Opera 's latest State of the Mobile Web report has shown a massive rise in the use of Facebook through mobile devices , but an even more explosive growth for microblogging service Twitter . Opera 's monthly report delves into the aggregated usage reports it receives from users of the popular Opera mini – giving a snapshot of what people are surfing through their smartphones and other mobile devices . January 's report looks at social networking – and although the service 's popularity in Russia gives it a bit of a .ru skew , the growth of Twitter and Facebook are clear . Facebook number one If Opera 's report is representative , Facebook is now the clear leader as the most used social network from mobile phones , partly due to a huge 619 per cent growth through 2009 . However , the real success story was Twitter – which despite only entering the top ten list at number seven has apparently experienced a growth of nearly 3,000 per cent . Although it was leapfrogged by Twitter , MySpace also grew – picking up an 84 per cent increase , but Friendster use declined by 29 per cent pushing it out of the top three .

Manchester United has apparently put its foot-down over its players ' social-networking habits and announced on its official website that no player in the team uses Facebook or Twitter . While it was unlikely that any of the team actually maintained their own social-networking page anyway , according to EPL Talk all Twitter and Facebook pages pertaining to the team have now been deleted . This comes after Man Utd 's website issued a warning , explaining : `` The club wishes to make it clear that no Manchester United players maintain personal profiles on social networking websites . `` Fans encountering any web pages purporting to be written by United players should treat them with extreme scepticism . `` Any official news relating to Manchester United or its players will be communicated via ManUtd.com . '' Accounts deleted EPL Talk does note , however , that some players did used to have Twitter and Facebook accounts – these have either been shut down or the contents removed . This is in stark contrast to the likes of Sunderland player Darren Bent who went as far as getting his Twitter account name ( @ DBTheTruth ) sewn into his boots . At least he used his account to issue out a grovelling apology after his team faced a 7-2 drubbing at the hands of Chelsea at the weekend . Some two hours after the game he posted : `` ... Bad day today feel sorry for any supporter who went today . We will bounce straight back I 'm convinced . 150 % commited [ sic ] to the cause . '' A little digging has found that Rio Ferdinand does indeed still have a MySpace page but this seem to nothing but an advert for his business assets , so looks to be run by his management . It will be interesting to see how many other football teams follow suit .
Facebook has once again shown it is playing catch-up to Twitter in the functionality stakes , with the soft launch of its own retweet function – which it 's called Share . Up until now there has been no way to share other people 's status updates with the rest of your friends , but Facebook has decided to change this by adding some new functionality which will sit next to the Comment and Like buttons at the bottom of a post . Share and share alike Interestingly , the Twitter retweet was originally started by users of the site who felt that a particular tweet needed spreading to the masses . Now that Twitter has actually made the option official , it does seem that a lot of people are shunning this method for the plain old RT . Facebook will be hoping that sharing posts will give users yet another reason to come back more and more – much like the gravitational pull Twitter seems to have with its users . Other quite recent additions to Facebook – which remarkably resemble Twitter – are status tagging and the Live News feed .

Facebook has finally created the ultimate workaround for those who ca n't access Facebook at work – it 's allowing you to reply to posts through email . It 's a less than ideal situation for those who are banned from using Facebook at work but what it does mean is that you can make contact if needs-be to your fellow friends without actually accessing the social-networking site . Reply and send `` Were launching the ability for you to participate in these conversations by replying directly to these email notifications , '' says Facebook 's blog post . `` When you receive an email notification about comments , you can just click 'Reply ' and start typing a comment at the top of the email . Then hit `` Send '' from your email and your reply will automatically be added as a comment on Facebook without you having to even log in . '' If you are n't receiving these emails but your online friends are trying to contact you , then you have to go into your account settings and choose whether you want to receive emails or not . Who 'd have thought it – the next step in the social-networking journey is email .
Facebook and McAfee have teamed up to offer up free online security for users of the social-networking site . Facebook 's 350 million plus users will be able to download a six-month trial purchase of McAfee 's Internet Security Suite , which will protect computers from viruses and the like which could get picked up while your surfing through the myriad of social networks . Alongside the free trial , a new online tool has been developed which will scan and clean your computer if it thinks you have been attacked by malware . Free service `` If your computer is infected , you will be asked to run a scan ... and clean it before accessing Facebook , '' says Facebook 's blog about the new virus services . `` We 're not aware of another free internet service that takes this much responsibility for helping people keep their accounts secure . '' Facebook has also listed a spot-check on its blog for those who are surfing the net . It 's all self-explanatory stuff but if you want to give it a look , then click on http : //blog.facebook.com .

Mark Zuckerberg , the founder of Facebook , has said that the growth of social networking over the last decade means that people no longer have an expectation of privacy . The 25-year-old Facebook entrepreneur was speaking at TechCrunch 's 'Crunchie ' awards in San Francisco over the weekend and said that privacy was no longer a `` social norm '' . `` People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds , but more openly and with more people… That social norm is just something that has evolved over time , '' said Zuckerberg . `` When I got started in my dorm room at Harvard , the question a lot of people asked was , 'why would I want to put any information on the internet at all ? ' `` Then in the last 5 or 6 years , blogging has taken off in a huge way , and just all these different services that have people sharing all this information . '' By no coincidence at all , Facebook has recently changed the privacy settings of its 350 million users . Have you checked your settings recently ? Zuckerberg backtracks `` A lot of companies would be trapped by the conventions and their legacies of what they 've built , '' said the Facebook founder . `` Doing a privacy change for 350 million users is not the kind of thing that a lot of companies would do . But we viewed that as a really important thing , to always keep a beginner 's mind and what would we do if we were starting the company now and we decided that these would be the social norms now and we just went for it . '' Microsoft researcher and social networking expert Danah Boyd disagrees , having told the Guardian : `` Kids have always cared about privacy , it 's just that their notions of privacy look very different than adult notions . '' We reported back in October how Zuckerberg was changing his thinking , and his position on , the private versus the public space on Facebook . Is Facebook , or 'Facecrack ' as many bored office workers refer to it these days , your favourite waste of time ? If so , you might just want to check those privacy settings again… Via Guardian.co.uk

Did you have a nice Christmas ? Craig 'Lazie ' Lynch did , seeing as he absconded from prison on 24 September this year - and has been taunting police about his whereabouts and continued life of freedom via aggressive photo updates on Facebook ever since . Over the Christmas holidays , Craig uploaded a picture of himself holding a turkey to Facebook , along with a - very poorly written - message boasting about still being free for his Christmas binge while the cops were failing to track him down . Lynch now has over 1,200 Facebook friends enjoying his on-the-run campaign of cyber-terror , but his ballsy actions have spawned a protest group - in which other users complain about those who are egging on the criminal in his goading of the law . Negative feedback Meanwhile , online car boot sale site eBay came to the rescue of Tristan Brooks , who had around £8,000-worth of stuff nicked from his flat . When police failed to turn up any culprits , Brooks turned to eBay - and managed to track down his stolen fridge . THAT 'S MY FRIDGE : I 'd know that stained milk shelf anywhere `` I logged on and all of a sudden I was staring at the screen and looking at my fridge freezer '' he said of the event , which shall henceforth be known as the Miracle of the White Goods . Posing as an interested buyer , Brooks contacted the fridge-seller and managed to confirm the fridge was his particular fridge ( he did n't recognise it , he kept serial numbers ) , then sent the police around to nick the seller and recover the rest of his stuff . Home economical A man who calls himself `` Darin Cosgrove '' has managed to increase his car 's fuel economy by 15 per cent , thanks to sticking a `` boat tail '' monstrosity on the back of it . The curved homemade construction , built out of cardboard and tape , enhances the aerodynamics of the car and reduces drag , improving economy as a result . Darin , who runs a site about efficient driving and car-modding called EcoModder , now gets 64mpg out of his battered old 1998 Pontiac Firefly , claiming the handling is the same as it was before - although he now has to deal with non-believers laughing at him . HEALTH & EFFICIENCY : Boost efficiency further still by getting a bicycle Continue until wife stops breathing An American couple 's GPS device nearly killed them by sending them off down a remote , snow-filled country road , then realised its mistake and saved their lives - by automatically calling for help when the weather lifted enough for the satnav to signal for assistance . The call-for-help was issued thanks to the American E911 system , which lets certain GPS phones on certain networks send out emergency signals with embedded location data . PLEASE SEND HOT TEA : Technology develops ability to cover its own arse The fully-automated mishap , reported by USA Today , tells of the epic journey of John and Starry Bush-Rhoads , who ended up getting themselves stuck in snow for two and a half days . Fortunately , they had planned ahead for the ineptitude of modern technology , packing food , water and spare clothes , just like the way Ripley in Aliens never really trusts Bishop .

US troops are now allowed to use Twitter and Facebook following a recent review of internet use by the US Defence department . A number of sites blocked by the Pentagon in 2007 - including YouTube – will all now be unblocked and accessible to soldiers in war zones , allowing them to stay in touch with their loved ones back home far easier than ever before . US Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , has a Twitter feed with over 16,000 followers . This Web 2.0 phenomena ... `` We need to take advantage of these capabilities that are out there - this Web 2.0 phenomena , '' said David Wennergren , deputy assistant secretary of defence for information technology . `` And what we had were inconsistent approaches . Some websites were blocked and some commands were blocking things . `` The idea is be responsible and use these tools to help get the job done , '' he added . `` There are two imperatives . One is the ability to share information . The other is about security - we need to be good at both . '' Via BBC

A patent filed by Facebook 's founders – including Mark Zuckerberg – has been validated this week which shows the company claiming the idea of a news feed as its own . Facebook 's News Feed is where the site lets its users know just what their friends are up to . Within this feed there is also the Live Feed which treads on Twitter 's toes – offering live status updates of what people are up to . This is the main problem . Sites like Twitter are essentially a news feed and MySpace , even Google , use a news feed of some sort to distribute content . Status update At first glance this could mean big trouble for a number of sites , if Facebook decided to coin it in when it comes to its patent . Bu it 's not as clear-cut as this . The site which unearthed the patent , All Facebook , has an update which notes that 'status updates ' are n't part of the patent , merely the actions of a user 's friend . For example , 'John Smith tagged an embarrassing photo of you/wrote about copping off with your mum on your wall ' . This should mean that Twitter and the like are safe but any site using an activity stream out there should be a bit worried .

Google has started adding the Facebook status of pages , not individuals , to its real-time search , following on from the news last week that it was integrating MySpace statuses into its searches . Since it 's been showing Tweets since the end of 2009 , that means Google now carries updates from all the major social networks . However , Microsoft 's Bing still has the edge when it comes to Facebook . Bing can show the public status updates of individuals under the deal Redmond has with Mark Zuckerberg and Co ; Microsoft has invested in the social networking site and provides its search . Google , however , can only show the status update for Facebook Pages . Those , by definition , cover `` organisations , businesses , celebrities , and bands to broadcast great information to fans in an official , public manner . '' There are about three million Facebook Pages , while the site itself has 400 million active users . No money changed hands The deals allowing both Bing and Google to shows Facebook data have cost the search engines any money , a fact confirmed by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg . The idea is to drive even more people to the site . Quite appropriately , Google announced the news via…a Tweet .

New statistics from Experian Hitwise have found that the inhabitants of Sunderland are more likely to log on to social-networking site Facebook than people from elsewhere in the UK . The statistic was compiled for the BBC 2 documentary , The Virtual Revolution . According to that , Sunderland 's inhabitants are a staggering 24 per cent more likely to log into Facebook than people living in other cities . It 's not certain as to whether that 's a comment on recreation in Wearside . Robin Goad , Director of Experian Hitwise , said : `` We find social networking is more popular in smaller towns and cities compared to large ones . Our belief is people in larger cities have most of their friends living closer to them than people in smaller cities . '' Not big in Scotland Sunderland Football Club has its own Facebook page , with over 9,200 fans , and local band the Futureheads boast more than 8,000 fans on their page on the site . Back in 2004 Microsoft awarded the city a £10 million web prize . The other cities where Facebook is extremely popular are Durham , Bolton , Llandudno and Manchester . Although Facebook is big up north , head beyond the border and the reverse is true ; all the bottom 10 cities for the site are in Scotland , with the likes of Aberdeen and Perth , and Kilmarnock and Motherwell bringing up the very rear .
The Bishop of Crediton , Robert Evens , has set up a Facebook page where he will take prayer requests during Lent . Known as Bishop Bob 's prayers , the page currently has a meagre 88 fans , but plenty of requests and encouragement in the wall postings . Bishops Evens has promised to offer silent prayer for the requests from 11.30am to 1.30pm on 13 March in Exeter Cathedral . The prayer session is open to the public . Bishop Bob explained his reason for setting up the page : `` Prayer is hugely important for many people whether they are churchgoers or not . `` I want to encourage people to pray , and many people feel very supported in knowing that someone else is praying for them , or alongside them . '' Travelling Prayers The Bishop will also offer prayers when he 's on the road , adding `` I will be pulling over in lay-bys all over Devon , as well as adding people to my prayers at home each day . '' He hopes that using Facebook , with its massive base of people , will make prayer more accessible to millions . All prayer requests , he said , will be treated in the strictest confidence . Religion and technology have been coming a lot closer recently , with plenty of religious apps for smartphones , as we detailed earlier this week . No word , though , on whether a prayer for Leeds United to receive automatic promotion to the Championship this season is acceptable .

Google 's Bradley Horowitz has insisted that Google Buzz is not a direct competitor for the likes of Facebook and Twitter , but that it fills a niche 'not currently met by market ' . Although it has suffered a controversial birth , the company believes that the combination of various Google functionality and the third-party support will win out . When asked by eWeek whether Buzz was a competitor to Twitter and Facebook Horowitz stated `` Absolutely not . '' A new category of communication `` …this is creating a new category of communication . It 's filling a niche which is currently not met in the market , '' he added . `` I think something unique is happening on Buzz that will continue to evolve . `` It 's hard to create a trend line or extrapolate too much from six days of use , but certainly conversation and the conversational Web is a place where Buzz has excelled . I think it is unique and offers a compelling interesting experience . '' Question mark There are still major question marks over Buzz , especially with some features still not working as fluidly as Google will have hoped , but the potential behind a social network from the internet giant is clear . The controversy around Google 's old enemy – privacy – has certainly dealt damage to Buzz in the crucial early fight for leverage , but after speedy changes the company will be hoping that its latest service can battle back .

Five people have filed a class action suit against social networking site Facebook in the US District Court for the Northern District of California concerning privacy changes implemented at the end of last year . The lawsuit claims that the changes actually reduced , rather than increased , the privacy of Facebook users . That 's contrary to what the company claimed . Where a single click once took care of privacy , with only a user name and the networks a user belong to available on public search , now a great deal more is accessible , including photos and listing of friends , as well as geographic data . `` Misleading , confusion and disingenuous '' The lawsuit , which calls Facebook 's messages about the changes `` misleading , confusing and disingenuous , '' is seeking unspecified damages . It asserts there are now at least 29 privacy settings spread over a number of Web pages , a procedure it calls `` grossly ineffective and users are misled into allowing Facebook to having their personal information easily accessed for commercial use , exposing them to identity theft , harassment , embarrassment , intrusion and all types of cybercrime . '' When Facebook first explained the changes last December , Electronic Frontier Foundation Kevin Bankston issued a warning about them : In a blog post he wrote : `` Our conclusion ? These new 'privacy ' changes are clearly intended to push Facebook users to publicly share even more information than before . Even worse , the changes will actually reduce the amount of control that users have over some of their personal data . '' Before the changes , somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of Facebook users adjusted their privacy settings . There are no figures on how many attempt it these days .
Microsoft has announced that the beta of its social connector for Outlook will soon be expanded to include MySpace , Facebook , and Windows Live . The software , first mooted last November , adds a new pane to the main mail reading screen in Outlook . This shows recent activity among friends on a social networking site whenever a user clicks on Outlook to read an email message . To date , though , the only social network hooked up to the social connector is LinkedIn . Microsoft obviously hopes that the addition of the new networks will make Outlook into a social networking hub . On the Office 2010 beta site , the company promises : `` Synchronise your contact data right into Outlook 2010 and obtain information about your friends and colleagues . See status updates from various networks and recently posted files—even view shared photos . `` Connect to SharePoint Server 2010 social data and receive updates from your workplace , such as newly posted or tagged documents , site activity , and more . '' Coming soon-ish Users can currently only read information from LinkedIn on Outlook , not change their own status or upload material . Microsoft says that the plug-ins to access Facebook , MySpace and Windows Live in social connector will be online by the time Office 2010 lands on shelves in June . In the meantime , a beta of Office 2010 is available free . Curiously , Microsoft forgot to mention Google Buzz in there .
Facebook has announced to Mobile World Congress that it will be releasing a text-only , low-bandwidth version of the social networking site `` in the coming weeks . '' The site ( http : //zero.facebook.com ) is already live , but people will only be able to use it when it 's been adopted by networks . Given that Facebook claims that over 100 million people worldwide access the site from their mobiles , expect that to happen very soon . The GSM Association says that of the time people spend online on their mobiles , almost half is at Facebook . In December alone it accounted for 2.2 billion minutes . According to a Facebook spokesman : `` 'Zero ' is a light-weight version of m.facebook.com that omits data intensive applications like Photos . `` It will launch in coming weeks and we are discussing it at MWC as an option to make Facebook on the mobile web available to everyone , anywhere and allow operators to encourage more mobile Internet usage . '' Adds to Facebook Lite Facebook already offers Facebook Lite , aimed more at the developing world , where Internet connections can be very slow . It cuts out some data-intensive applications . That customisation has helped increase the social network 's penetration globally . The site does work with mobile operators , and already has mobile versions for different handsets . This , however , strips everything right back , which will please the networks , as it should free up bandwidth . The only problem is that it 's much harder to upload embarrassing text . Via BBC

Facebook has opened up Facebook Chat to allow it to be integrated into a number of other popular desktop instant messaging clients , expanding the functionality of its social network to over 400 million members . `` By integrating Facebook Chat with your preferred instant messenger , you 'll never miss a message when you have to navigate away from Facebook and you 'll be in control of how and where you chat with your Facebook friends , '' says Facebook . `` Simply connect your Facebook account with the instant messaging client of your choice and start chatting . You will not need to stay logged in to Facebook.com to continue to access your Facebook friends '' . Facebook Chat will now work with your AOL Instant Messenger account and other IM clients that use Jabber , including iChat , Pidgin , Adium and Miranda . Open web emerges Mickael Remond , CEO of ProcessOne , told us the following regarding Facebook 's latest move to open up Facebook chat to speak with other instant messaging providers `` With Facebook opening up its chat to connect with other IM providers this is sign of the 'open ' web emerging enabling users to communicate with each other irrespective of platform , thereby breaking down walls between online communities . With the integration with Facebook adding about 300 million potential users , XMPP is now by far the largest standard protocol for instant messaging and real-time web communications . `` Gtalk , Nokia Ovi and Livejournal all have chat based on XMPP meaning that it now also has the largest instant messaging user base in the world . This is a demonstration of the growing popularity of XMPP in the messaging space . It is already being used as part of Google Wave and I am sure that it will spread to other forms of real-time web communication in the future . '' Via Facebook

Todd Jackson , Product Manager for Google Buzz has just been showing off Google 's latest sharing tool that is set to take the real time web to the masses . Google Buzz is part of Gmail and key features include : • Automatic friends lists ( friends are added automatically who you have emailed on Gmail ) • `` Rich fast sharing '' combines image sources and real-time feeds like Picasa and Twitter into a single feed , with full-sized photo browsing • Public and private sharing ( switch easily between family and friends ) • Inbox integration ( instead of emailing you with every update , like Facebook , Buzz features emails that update dynamically with Buzz thread content , ensuring you do n't get emails you do n't need or want ) • `` Recommended Buzz '' puts friend-of-friend content into your stream , learning which recommendations you want the more you use it and the more feedback you give it . Voice-posting , location-awareness Buzz really comes into its own on Google Android and Apple iPhone , where you can post entirely using your voice . There are three components to Google Buzz on mobile : A new mobile Google homepage with automatic geo-location and Buzz integration ; a web app for Google Android phones and iPhone which you can get here with some rather special speech-to-text powers ; and a new version of the hugely popular Google Maps that ties your location with Buzz . The location features are where Google Buzz will potentially pull users away from their Twitter and Facebook habits . You can add it in as a layer in Google Maps to see what people are Buzzing about nearby , and , should you wish , chip in your ten-penneth to the Buzz conversation . Google 's Places database has also been updated to integrate Buzz . Go to http : //www.google.com/buzz to get involved . See more on the mobile version of Buzz below : Stay tuned for updates ...

A new report from the European Network and Information Security Agency ( Enisa ) has highlighted the security dangers of using social network sites , the most obvious being Facebook and Twitter , with the threat the greatest when accessing the sites from a mobile phone . The report , which Enisa will be putting online when it 's published , highlights a number of examples where malware has been used on social networking sites for such crimes as identity theft . Although it admits that `` there is not yet any known mobile malware propagation , this kind of social network can send especially crafted software directly to mobile phones , using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi features in mobile phones to propagate . '' Golden rules In other words , it 's just a matter of time before viruses start spreading through mobiles , and the report also points out threat of corporate data leakages as more vital information is stored on smartphones . The Enisa report has 17 'golden rules ' to help people stay safe . Most are just common sense , such as paying attention to what you post and upload , using the privacy setting properly on social networking sites , and reporting lost or stolen mobiles immediately . One or two , though , go a little further , such as disabling location-based services on your mobile unless you need them and always reading the privacy policies of social networking sites to ensure you 're fully aware of all the risks posed by using your mobile to access such services . The iPhone has been a high profile example of such exploitation - a self-propagating worm took advantage of jailbroken devices to send pictures without consent , highlighting the danger posed .

Facebook has announced a birthday redesign , which is meant to `` help you find what you are looking for on Facebook '' . This is n't a completely new design , so there should n't be any of the backlash the social-networking site came under after it 's last change but a few things have been tweaked . Oh , and it just so happens to coincide with Facebook 's sixth birthday this week . These include : Sharing enriches It sounds like applications will play a significant part in Facebook in the future , with the blog post noting that : `` We think sharing information about the applications you use enriches the shared experience between you and your friends . `` At the same time , we feel strongly that control is an important element of any information sharing on Facebook . That 's why these features are launching with an entirely new privacy setting . '' So , anyone using Farmville , please for the love of our sanity – keep it private .
A prisoner at HMP Wolds in the UK has been posting on Facebook about his easy lifestyle . Using a smuggled mobile phone , Brendan Rawsthorn posted status updates and pictures of himself while in his cell , something forbidden by law in a prison . He talked about making a chocolate cake , playing PlayStation all day long and getting drunk on home-made prison brew - which we 're worried may have been made of urine . Chilling with the sounds Rawthorn was convicted in 2006 of Arson for setting fire to a builder 's yard , but clearly is enjoying his new lifestyle - talking about `` listing [ sic ] to music with my feet up . '' Facebook has since removed the offending profile page , stating it contravenes its terms of use . The managing company for the prison pointed to the decreasing size of the mobile phone as the reason they are becoming harder to detect . Although mobile phone jamming equipment is illegal in the UK , its use in prisons is possible in the near future to stop instances like this .

When Facebook turned five , we - OK , I - said its success would n't last . That may have been premature . Facebook is six today , and it 's still piling on the users : last year it had 150 million active users , and now it 's got 350 million - 200 million of whom appear to be spamming us with invites for Mafia Wars . So were we wrong , or is Facebook just taking longer to jump the shark than we predicted ? It certainly looks like the former . The continuing rise of Facebook demonstrates something pretty amazing : the way in which technology is becoming increasingly available , affordable and egalitarian . People we 'd never have expected to see online in a million years are now online , and more often than not Facebook is the thing that 's got their attention . So , Facebook is brilliant , I 'm a great big numpty and everything in social networking land is groovy . Not so fast . Facebook is n't popular because it 's good . It 's popular because it 's popular . Facebook is the budget airline of tech . If Margaret Thatcher were to start a company that ran around giving small children Chinese burns , blasting Jedward through your windows at 3am and interrupting your thoughts every fifteen seconds with the wit and wisdom of Katie Price , it 'd still be more popular and more loved than budget airlines . And yet millions of people fly with them every year . Why do they do it ? There are two kinds of passenger : passengers new to the airline , and passengers who 've flown with them before . The former are excited , their brains full of the possibilities . Grin and bear it The latter grin and bear it in the knowledge that it 's the only way to get where they want to go at the price they want to pay . If they do n't , no problem : the airline just does a few more rubbish ads to attract some new passengers . Facebook 's rather like that . To its constant stream of new arrivals it 's a playground , a world of joy and adventure . They have n't been on long enough to get sick of the oversharers and quiz takers - in fact , the odds are that they 'll be the oversharers and quiz takers - and they were n't on Facebook when the various privacy controversies took place . They 're far too busy playing FarmVille to worry about the enormous amounts of information a remote and unaccountable corporation is collating about them . To the old hands , it 's a compromise : they 're not keen on the privacy implications , on the way in which the Live Feed/News Feed distinction buries everything important and ensures you see only trivia , and they 'd rather not spend half of their time fending off invitations to play stupid games , take part in stupid quizzes , or become fans of stupid products - but that 's where everyone else happens to be . Of course , not everyone grins and bears it . Some commit Facebook suicide ; far more simply stop logging in . But Facebook does n't care , because every new sign-up invites all their friends , who invite all their friends , who invite… eventually Facebook will do something really , spectacularly stupid , or everybody will hit their 150-friend mental maximum , or The Kids will realise that Facebook 's becoming OldPeopleBook and will head for a service their parents ca n't use to annoy them . For now , though , Facebook is flying high . See you next year !

Facebook has outlined a number of changes to its privacy settings , which includes the sharing of user information to third parties . The changes mean that advertisers may start to tailor ads to your interests on the site - much like they do at the moment , with users who are part of Facebook Connect . Like most settings within Facebook at the moment , users will automatically be included to give your information away to 'pre-approved third-party applications ' , unless they manually go into the settings and opt-out of the service . `` We occasionally need to provide General Information about you to pre-approved third party websites and applications that use Platform at the time you visit them ( if you are still logged in to Facebook ) , '' notes Facebook . `` Similarly , when one of your friends visits a pre-approved website or application , it will receive General Information about you so you and your friend can be connected on that website as well ( if you also have an account with that website ) . '' The time and the place The information given out is actually quite detailed . It includes your date of birth and what device you use to access and even your location . The location part is an interesting one , as it relates to something that is n't happening on the site yet . Facebook is changing its location information to include places . This brings Facebook in line with services like Foursquare , which merges social-networking with locations . `` We 've removed the old language and instead added the concept of a 'place ' that could refer to a page , such as one for a local restaurant , '' explains Facebook on its blog . `` As we finalise the product , we look forward to providing more details , including new privacy controls . '' While it 's great that Facebook is being transparent about its privacy options , it 's a worry that it seems to be changing its privacy settings more frequently . Facebook has said that these changes are n't set in stone quite yet , however , and it is asking its users to comment on the new settings .

Facebook has rolled out its happiness index application to include the state of people 's emotions in the UK , Canada and Australia . Originally a US-only project , the Gross National Happiness index looks at people 's status updates and decides what days of the year we are at our highest and lowest emotionally . The information mined is n't exactly , well , mind-blowing but it does show a correlation between holidays and 'event ' days and how people who use the social network feel . `` Although there are differences between the nations ' GNH graphs , they are more similar than they are different , '' says the Facebook blog . `` Christmas , New Year 's Eve and Valentine 's Day are amongst the happiest days across the board . `` Negativity is trending down over time for most nations , likely due to the changing demographics of Facebook users that now include more older people , and perhaps also due to the economic recovery . '' Stat of play Some Brit-specific information which the graph shows is that the UK was emotionally on a high on dates that coincided with the X Factor final ( something that frankly depresses TechRadar ) and when we had the first snow day last year . Our depression seems to be linked with that of the world of celebrity , with Cheryl Cole announcing her split with Ashley Cole one of the UK 's most negative days on Facebook . At first glance , the Gross National Happiness index may seem throwaway . But for statisticians it 's gold , as it makes public vast amounts of anonymous data from one of the biggest sites in the world .
FarmVille , the ridiculously popular Facebook app , has decided that Facebook is n't a big enough platform for the game and has launched its very own website . Farmville.com is the games new , official website which offers links to the Farmville forum , support and access to the game 's shop . That 's right , FarmVille has its own shop where you can pick up everything from mugs to keyrings to t-shirts . We looked for a model of a cash cow being milked , but that item seems to be out of stock . Self-farming You can also play FarmVille on the website - crazy , we know . It has n't completely got rid of its Facebook roots , though , as the only way you can play the game is through the Facebook Connect service . There 's no doubting FarmVille 's insane popularity , but does it really warrant its very own website ? If it means we are one step closer to getting rid of those annoying Facebook status updates about what livestock so-and-so has bought , then it gets a thumbs-up from us . Via NowPublic

Microsoft has launched the official Facebook fan page for its Bing search engine . Following a first post on Friday , the site has picked up 22 fans at the time of writing , although the first attempts at publicising it have only just started in earnest . `` The official Bing UK fan page has launched , '' tweeted the official Bing UK Twitter account . A US fan site for Bing has more than half a million members , so the UK Bing Facebook fan page has some way to go Google dominance With Google hugely dominant in UK search , Microsoft will be pushing hard to win back market share . The Bing search engine has won praise , but faces the difficult task of converting the UK public . Will a Facebook fan page help ? Only time will tell .

Erik Huggers , the BBC 's Head of Future Media and Technology , has revealed that social-networking tools are coming to the Player , with Twitter and Facebook integration already poised for launch . Speaking at the Guardian 's Changing Media Summit 2010 , Huggers revealed that the next iteration of the BBC iPlayer ( dubbed iPlayer 3.0 ) will launch soon and Facebook , Twitter and Bebo were already signed up as partners . BBC goes social `` We are close to launching the third version of the iPlayer in beta which will have many more social functions embedded within it , '' explained Huggers to the Telegraph . `` People will be able to bring their Facebook friends onto the iPlayer so they can share what they are listening to or watching with each other more easily . '' For this content sharing to work , it looks like a password protection scheme will be put into place for the iPlayer , where you would have to add in your Facebook and Twitter log-in details to the site . Once logged in , users would see 'coloured puffs ' of information about what your friends were watching and so on . iPlayer lite ? Alongside iPlayer 3.0 , there will also be a lite version of the service launched which will be embeddable into other areas of the BBC website . Although Huggers was coy about what this would look like , he did note that it would resemble the iPlayer 's functionality .

In cyberspace it seems that deceased serial killers can live on . I know this first hand , because for the last few months a character calling themselves `` Fred West '' has been running a Fan Page in my honour . There 's even a picture of the murderer on his profile , and a status message that says he loves to `` potter around under people 's patios '' Facebook rules state that only authorised representatives of companies , celebrities and music groups are allowed to create Fan Pages - other users should create groups instead . I would n't exactly classify myself as a `` celebrity '' , but clearly `` Fred West '' did not have my permission to create a Fan Page in my honour . Furthermore , friends , acquaintances , and people who might know me for my work in the computer security field , are joining the Fan Page in the belief that they are somehow connecting with me . They have no way of telling that I did n't create this Fan Page . As someone who has received anonymous death threats from Facebook users in the past , I do n't see the funny side in someone called Fred West creating a Facebook page about me . I 've reported the abuse to the Facebook team and asked them to remove the Fan Page , but no action has yet been taken and the page remains in place at the time of writing . If Facebook simply tightened up the process for creating a Fan Page on its site , so that the creators needed to prove that they are genuinely affiliated to the celebrity or company they are making the page for it would drastically reduce the number of fake Fan Pages and make the site safer . So , how about it Facebook ? Is n't it time to implement some better checks if you want to enforce your own rules ?

Facebook is culling some of the applications available on its site , believing them to be nothing but conduits for advertising . The ingeniously monikered 'stalker apps ' allow you to see who has been checking up on your profile – presumably to give you some sort of self-esteem boost , by proving that people actually care about your entire life and not just your witty status updates . According to the BBC , a number of apps have disappeared from the social-networking site , including the idiotically titles 'Stalker Check ' and the not-so-catchily named 'Who has visited my profile ' . Stalking status update `` Do n't believe any applications that claim they can show you who 's viewing your profile or photo . They ca n't , '' said a spokesperson for Facebook , who has obviously tried one of these applications and were unhappy that no one was interested in their status . According to Facebook , rather than actually do what they say on the tin , the apps merely push you on to advertising . These are completely unrelated to the site 's gaming apps like Farmville which push you to violence . Well , the continued updates of how your mates are doing with their virtual farms do . Via BBC
Facebook is officially the most-visited website in the US this week , knocking Google off of the top spot – where it has been since 2007 . Facebook has been enjoying phenomenal growth in 2010 , with the site showing a 185 per cent increase since March 2009 . Hitwise , which monitors everything web , web , web , noted that Facebook had 7.07 per cent of all US visits in the week ending 13 March , compared to Google which hosted 7.03 per cent . Popularity contest Interestingly , the last site to nab the number one spot from Google was MySpace back in 2007 . Facebook will be hoping that this is n't an ominous sign of things to come . Facebook also enjoyed being the number one site in the US over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day , but it could n't hold on to the position for the whole week . With 350 million plus visitors worldwide , Facebook 's popularity has never been greater – then again , just two year ago MySpace must have been thinking exactly the same thing .

Facebook has contacted TechRadar with regards to the Daily Mail 's recent report accusing the site of lax security measures for younger users , explaining that it is `` not ruling out legal action '' over the article . Earlier this week , the Daily Mail published an article titled ' I posed as a girl of 14 on Facebook . What followed will sicken you ' which outlined how easy it was for underage members of the site to get chatting to complete strangers . After the article was published both online and in the paper , the person who wrote the piece , Mark William-Thomas – a retired policeman and now criminologist – claimed that he never once said the site he outlined in the piece was Facebook , but another unnamed social network . The addition of the Facebook brand name was in fact inserted by the Daily Mail . This is something that , for obvious reasons , Facebook is n't happy with . Extremely concerned `` We are extremely concerned by the behaviour of the Daily Mail , who have since corrected the story somewhat and made some clarifying statements , '' a spokesperson for Facebook told TechRadar . But it 's not just the fact that Facebook were wrongly name-checked but the site who really does let underage users vulnerable to online abuse has not been outed . `` We should all be concerned that their refusal to name the network they did use for the experiment is not helping to expose the real places where people are vulnerable online , '' notes Facebook , also explaining `` we are in discussions with them and have not ruled out legal action . '' Push the button Facebook is no stranger to controversy , with the site criticised last year for not adding a CEOP report button for young people to click if they get into problems online . This is despite the company already offering myriad ways to report problems on its site . The Daily Mail saga highlights a problem which brands like Hoover have had in the past . Facebook is so successful it is now synonymous with social networking . Because of this it is in real danger of becoming a catch-all term and , in turn , demonised when social-networking anywhere on the web turns nasty .

While there is currently a cool 32 million people regularly playing FarmVille on a daily basis on Facebook , the social network has made a plea to games developers to create 'iconic games ' such as Mario , Halo or Sonic for the platform . Facebook Platform Manager , Gareth Davis , speaking at this week 's Games Developers Conference in San Francisco , reminded devs that the next killer game was out there and that Facebook was ready to help to host it and popularise it . Research suggests around three quarters of Facebook 's 400m users regularly play social games on the site . `` The next killer game is still out there and this game will come from you , '' Gareth Davis told a room of designers in San Francisco . `` When we look at every major game platform , we see that there is an iconic defining game on that platform whether it 's Sonic or Mario or Halo . `` And while there are some great games on Facebook today , no one has yet produced the iconic game for [ it ] . The Facebook Mario is still out there , '' added Davis . FarmVille leads the charge `` [ FarmVille ] has grown to $ 1bn from nothing nearly three years ago . It is definitely a mass market phenomenon across the board and represents a change in the way people play games and interact with their friends , '' said Justin Smith of research firm Inside Network . This is just the beginning of Facebook 's move into the game space , according to Gareth Davis . `` We are going to see multiple games with more than 100m people playing each one . That is as many people as watched the recent superbowl , the most watched TV programme in American history . `` The growth we are seeing is amazing and in a short space of time we have developed a brand new mass market audience for gaming . '' Namechecking Battle.net , Xbox Live and games like Rock Band Davis reminded the developers in San Fran this week that : `` The most profound revolutions , the most significant disruption , is how social games are designed . They are made for social interaction - people want to play with their friends . '' `` Social games are the past , present and future of the games industry . Someday soon all games will be as social as they were in the past - and we wo n't call them social games , we 'll just call them games again . ''

Facebook is set to be worth over $ 1 billion a year ( £666.4 million ) , according to new figures that estimate projected revenue for the social networking site . Facebook is set to break the billion dollars of revenue mark by the end of 2010 , according to Inside Facebook 's new figures . Tending virtual farms Facebook has over 400 million users , many of whom spend an inordinate amount of time poking their online mates and tending to their virtual farms . Inside Facebook says that the fastest growing part of the company 's market is `` performance advertising '' – whereby companies use ads in Facebook to drive the use of their own games and apps such as the incredibly popular casual game FarmVille . That same report from Inside Facebook claims Facebook made $ 635m in 2009 .

YouTube and Facebook users have weighed in on upcoming general election , with some 180,000 users voting for which questions were to be asked in the UK 's first Digital Debate . Over 5,300 questions were submitted by YouTube and Facebook users and , in the end , the 10 most popular questions were used . Digital economy questions As these questions were answered before the Thick Of It style Brown / bigot shenanigans of this week , there were no apologising from Gordon Brown , but he did sound off on banking , mephedrone and interestingly had this to say about the Digital Economy Bill : `` I think there 's got to be a lot more debate about the digital policies of the future . '' Which does sound like the Bill is not yet set in stone . The questions were definitely aimed at a more youthful audience , with the problems of methedrone highlighted . Liberal Democrats ' leader Nick Clegg said about methedrone that these things should be looked at `` on an entirely independent statutory basis so that experts once again lead this debate , not populism , not scaremongering . '' Web video It may not be as scintillating as watching the leaders sweat under hot studio lights in HD , but the web videos do show the politicians in a different light . Well , David Cameron and Clegg were tie-less and – Shock ! Horror ! – Cameron decided to answer his questions outside . Brown chose the safe environment of a school where there was presumably nobody named Duffy on the register . Unfortunately , some of the questions which did n't make the list were : `` What 's your favourite type of Pokemon ? '' and `` Where are the jobs . Where are they ? '' Also `` what is your favourite food ? '' To see for yourself what went on in the digital debates , log on to www.youtube.com/ukelection and facebook.com/democracyuk .
According to reports , Yahoo fancies buying Foursquare - and both Facebook and Microsoft have been sniffing around , too . We think Facebook should stop sniffing and stump up some cash before its rivals do . If Facebook is n't seriously considering a purchase - or developing a similar service , ahem , `` inspired by '' Foursquare - then its executives are completely nuts . They 'd be nuts for two reasons : first , because real-world check-ins mean people would spend even more time using Facebook.com and the various Facebook mobile apps , and secondly because Foursquare has the potential to be the internet equivalent of the Tesco Clubcard . That could make a big difference to Facebook 's income . The problem with Facebook is that while it gets Google-esque levels of traffic - in March its homepage had 7.07 % of US internet visits compared to Google 's 7.03 % - it does n't generate Google-esque amounts of money . The Wall Street Journal predicts that Facebook will bring in $ 710 million this year , but that 's small potatoes compared to search : in the first quarter of this year , Google 's revenues were $ 6.77 billion . Adding up Why are the numbers so different ? One key reason is that when you Google , you 're looking for something - so if Google sticks relevant adverts on your search results for smartphones , holidays , fridge freezers or anything else then it 's going to generate a decent number of clicks from people who are interested in the advertiser 's product . On Facebook , though , things are different . You do n't go on Facebook to look for a new washing machine ; you go on to play Farmville , or to stalk ex-partners , or to see what daft videos your friends have linked to . Ads on that kind of activity are n't very effective . That 's where Foursquare could come in . By adding location-based `` Here I am ! '' features to Facebook , the site could deliver advertising that 's much more relevant than anything Google search can offer advertisers . A Google search tells advertisers what you 're interested in , but a Foursquare update can tell advertisers where you are and what you 're about to do . Clubs could tempt nearby punters out of bars and into their establishments . Restaurants could offer vouchers or specials . Airport-based businesses could tempt you from the other side of the terminal . Businesses could use Foursquare 's badges as loyalty schemes , and historical location data could build up extraordinarily detailed pictures of people 's interests . Not only that , but Foursquare can tell businesses whether their promotions work , and could be a mechanism for online ticketing . You can see why it would be good for Facebook , but it would also be good for us : with a simple , effective and lucrative way to make proper money from social networking , Facebook might even stop looking for new and exciting ways to mine our personal data and make its privacy features more confusing . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Liked this ?

Whether you think it 's a handy tool or insidious blight on the internet , nobody can deny that the Facebook Like button has been a hit – with a whopping 50,000 sites integrating the latest tool since launch . Facebook 's Like button along with Activity Feed and Recommendations were launched on 75 sites , but have quickly become familiar sights on the internet – not bad for something that arrived at the f8 conference on 21 April . The tools have been hit by criticism , with questions about privacy and what information people choose to share , but Facebook is celebrating a big hit already . Social plug-ins `` At f8 , we also launched new tools called social plug-ins — including the Like button , Activity Feed , and Recommendations — on more than 75 websites , '' Sandra Liu Huang said on the Facebook Developer blog . `` Already , just one week since launch , more than 50,000 sites across the web have implemented the new plug-ins . `` We are thrilled by the strong adoption so far as developers realise how easy social plug-ins are to use and how powerful they are in engaging users in a frictionless experience without requiring them to share any personal information . '' With Facebook Video overtaking some of the major players in the video market since launch , Farmville on Facebook having more users than Twitter and now a Like button that 's spreading across the web – the social network certainly is n't lacking in web influence .

Spotify has finally unveiled a new revamp that sees it bring Facebook integration and take a step closer to replacing iTunes on your computer . The first major change is the addition of Spotify Social , which uses Facebook from within the music program to let you share your track choices with buddies . The obvious benefit of this is that people can easily discover what their friends are looking at and listening too , as well as 'subscribing ' to the people that you think have the greatest taste ( you can easily spot these people : they 're wearing sunglasses in their profile picture ) . You got the power Friends online with Facebook and using Spotify Social will be listed at the side of the screen , and clicking in will let you see their profile picture and track listings for easy music stalkage . Spotify founder Daniel Ek spoke at SXSW earlier this year about the forthcoming social network integration , highlighting how it will make music more available to all users : `` We are looking at integrating some parts of the social aspect , '' he says . `` If you think about the problem of how do you browse music – most people approach the problem by looking at genres . I could probably come up with 200 different genres , but I do n't really know what 'neoclassical pop ' is . What classifies neo-rock or neo-pop ? `` Spotify is approaching 10 million tracks - how do you browse through 10 million tracks ? Searching is one solution but it 's not an optimum way of discovering new music . A social aspect is . '' The other big feature with the new update is the option to import your music files from your computer to the Spotify interface , thus making it much easier to listen to the tracks you want to without having to search for them time and time again . The new update will hit your computer later this week , but if you simply ca n't wait to try it out , head over to www.spotify.com/download and have a look-see for yourselves . Check out the video below to see for yourselves how it all works :

Facebook 's 'rate the debate dial ' experiment drew just 2,000 people for the second leaders ' debate , although a poll as the television event closed got 20,000 votes from users of the social networking site . Although the much-hyped dial only managed what would seem to be a minimal audience through the debate , it did throw up some interesting data . Again it was Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg that came out on top , not only picking up 48 per cent of the final vote , but also picking up the most positive feedback through his opening statement . Brown highs Bu it was Gordon Brown who picked up the biggest highs during the debate , with his answers on climate change , the pope and pensions enthusiastically received by users . Faith and religion did not go down well with the Facebook audience at all , and Clegg 's stance on terrorism gave him his low for the night . Richard Allan , Director of European Public Policy at Facebook commented : `` It 's clear that the TV debates are an historic moment , but with 76 rules of engagement and broadcasters banned from showing the audience reaction , it 's online where voters can express their opinion . `` Our dial test gave the power of opinion back to the public allowing them to say exactly if they liked what they are hearing in real time . '' All the results from the dial-test are available for download as a spreadsheet from a dedicated page , located at http : //apps.facebook.com/dialtest/export.php .

An ISP is offering customers and concerned parents a new web-filtering system that uses the British Board of Film Classification 's well-known age-ratings logos . It is the first time that the BBFC has teamed up with an internet service provider – allowing parents to select the level of filter that they require - U , PG , 12 , 15 or 18 – to ensure safe web surfing for their kids . Parents simply select the filter level they require – and Tibboh ( the ISP ) does the rest , using filtering technology such as Netsweeper to classify websites accordingly . Right now the service is only available as a 3G mobile dongle offering . Once customers have signed up then they can register various profiles for all the members of the family , according to their age . The service costs £19.99 a month and has a 15 gigabyte data limit . Facebook rated '12 ' Social networks such asFacebook and Twitter and search engines such as Google and Bing are rated '12 ' by Tibboh . `` Search engines are great but at the `` U '' and `` PG '' level we found so many results and sponsored links that were inappropriate , '' Tibboh MD Phil Dawson told the BBC . Tibboh claims its filtering tech has , to date , classified around three billion websites . The company effectively licenses the BBFC 's age-rating symbols , which it clearly feels is an ideal way of supporting the UK Council for Child Internet Safety ( UKCCIS ) 's `` Zip It , Block It , Flag It '' campaign . Andrew Cooke , of BBFC online says : `` We 're delighted to be able to welcome tibboh as the first internet service provider to meet the BBFC online membership standards . We 've been working very closely with tibboh and have helped them to develop bespoke criteria which match our standards . `` Parents often find themselves in the unenviable position of having to lay down the law in a digital universe they barely understand . Our classifications are understood and trusted by UK parents and they are based on our unique understanding of child development and parental expectations . Our research shows that 91 % of parents want to see BBFC film and DVD classification on downloads or streaming films and other digital audiovisual content . * '' For more info on the new system head over to tibboh 's own website ( www.tibboh.co.uk ) .
Mark Zuckerberg has explained the forthcoming changes to Facebook , including the way in which it plans to share the connections you make on sites with your friends on Facebook . Facebook is set to bring in a like button that will allow you to share and highlight content to your friends from other sites , something which founder Zuckerberg believes is increasingly important to the social network . `` We are making it so all websites can work together to build a more comprehensive map of connections and create better , more social experiences for everyone , '' Zuckerberg blogged . Redesigned `` We have redesigned Facebook Platform to offer a simple set of tools that sites around the web can use to personalize experiences and build out the graph of connections people are making , '' he added . `` This next version of Facebook Platform puts people at the center of the web . It lets you shape your experiences online and make them more social . `` For example , if you like a band on Pandora , that information can become part of the graph so that later if you visit a concert site , the site can tell you when the band you like is coming to your area . `` The power of the open graph is that it helps to create a smarter , personalized web that gets better with every action taken . '' Partnerships Facebook has partnered with the likes of Pandora , Yelp and Microsoft to showcase the new Facebook Platform – which spells the end of the Facebook Connect branding . `` We think that the future of the web will be filled with personalized experiences . We 've worked with three pre-selected partners - Microsoft Docs , Yelp and Pandora - to give you a glimpse of this future , which you can access without having to login again or click to connect . `` For example , now if you 're logged into Facebook and go to Pandora for the first time , it can immediately start playing songs from bands you 've liked across the web . `` And as you 're playing music , it can show you friends who also like the same songs as you , and then you can click to see other music they like . '' It 's certainly exciting times if you like sharing , and it will be interesting to see how Google – a company whose Buzz tool has not had the impact it would have helped – responds .
Facebook users will now be able to 'discover , create , and share Microsoft Office documents ' with the announcement of Docs for Facebook in beta . Built using Office 2010 Web Apps , Microsoft states that Docs for Facebook provides the best possible document service for the Facebook environment . `` Docs gives you a great , flexible social–productivity experience , '' said Microsoft 's Fuse labs . Collaboration `` You can decide who to share with ... from privately creating , editing , and collaborating around docs , all the way to public sharing on the web . `` You can upload or start doc online , have someone help you edit it , incorporate feedback , and then share it with the world . `` Docs can be viewed and edited directly within a web browser – or , with a single click , you can edit them more richly and powerfully through the Microsoft Office software on your PC or Mac . '' Key times The online Web Apps functionality of Office 2010 is obviously hugely important for Microsoft , with Google Docs offering an alternative for both businesses and the general public . `` The fact that we 've been able to adapt the Office 2010 `` Web Apps '' technology to work directly with Facebook truly speaks to the flexibility and power not just of the Facebook platform , but also of the Office system 's rich `` contextual collaboration '' capabilities , '' said Lili Cheng , FUSE labs ' general manager . `` And we 'd never have been able to achieve our critical 'simplicity ' goals had it not been for our ability to use a new test feature from Facebook that allows us to build an instantly personalised and seamless document authorisation and sharing experience directly from our site . '' Powerful Facebook has become a hugely powerful force on the internet , with the social network vying with Google for the most visited destination in some markets . And although we are n't entirely sure we 'll see the Facebook generation editing that Excel spreadsheet , Microsoft will be delighted that it is getting the word out to a new generation about Office . In the meantime we 'll look forward to poking that PowerPoint and seeing if editing 20 Word docs gives an extra pig pen in Farmville .

Facebook has shut down Facebook Lite - but insists that the experiment was a success . Facebook Lite , launched last year , was designed for those with poor connections , offering a pared down service . Anyone trying to access the Lite version will now be redirected to full fat Facebook . No longer supporting it `` We 're no longer supporting it , but learned a lot from the test of a slimmed-down site , '' read a post on the Lite Facebook fan page . Speculation about exactly why Lite was finished is rife , but Facebook has remained closed lipped so far . Of course , it could well be that with phone versions and better connections proliferating , there simply was n't enough demand for a reduced service . We 'd ask if anyone here was upset , but we never got round to TechRadar Lite so you probably ca n't even read this . Via BBC

Facebook users will be able to rate the main candidates during their live television debates ahead of the election , with a 'dial test ' monitoring users ' opinions in real time . Technology is already playing a much larger roll in the forthcoming election than it ever has before , and the Speed Dial promises real-time social feedback on whether Labour 's PM Gordon Brown , the Conservatives ' David Cameron and Lib Dems leader Nick Clegg are appealing to the Facebook generation . `` With Britain 's first ever prime ministerial debate taking place on Thursday , Facebook 's 23 million UK users are being invited to participate in a mass `` dial test '' which will enable them rate the debates in real time and provide instant feedback on the performance of the three party leaders , '' explained Facebook . `` The dial test will give a detailed , moment-by-moment snapshot of exactly how voters up and down the country are reacting to the debate between the three candidates for prime minister . `` Never before has this kind of online opinion test been attempted on this scale or at this level of sophistication in the UK . '' Rate the debate The Speed Dial works by asking users to rate , during the debates , to use the dial to indicate how much they agree or disagree with the debates as they happen . So when the Digital Economy Act gets mentioned you would imagine that leading parties might not win the approval they desire , following its controversial passage through Parliament . `` The first prime ministerial debates are a landmark moment in British politics , but the rigid rules mean that the voters themselves have a limited role , said Richard Allan , Facebook 's Director of European Public Policy `` The mass dial test changes that completely . The Facebook dial test enables millions of voters to say exactly what they think of the three leaders ' performances and to wrest back control from politicians . `` 2010 is the UK 's first ever social media election , and the dial test shows how voters can get involved on a scale never seen before . The dial test will provide a true barometer of the public mood and will define how the impact of the debates is interpreted . '' A nice idea – but will it jar with a Facebook generation whose social network site represents poking and picture tagging rather than their political cares ? The first debate is on Thursday 15 April .

Facebook has still not full green-lit the use of a panic button on its site , despite increased pressure from CEOP – the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre . CEOP re-started discussions with the biggest social-networking site this week and while it has n't opted for a link to CEOP on its site , it has said it will forward all links to the centre . Jim Gamble , CEO of CEOP , said about his meeting with Facebook : `` I felt that at the end of what were lengthy and at times tense negotiation we are able to move towards a position . They are one small step away from doing the right thing . `` I am more optimistic than when I came . They are not saying no , that is very clear . But they were equally direct and they came with their own agenda . `` There is no doubt they are looking to improve their position around child safety and we recognise that . What I am looking for is turning words into action . '' Not yet a partner Facebook 's struggling rival BeBo added a CEOP report button to its site last November and the likes of Microsoft have also become partners . If Facebook were to eventually bow to CEOP , who want a one-click solution to help those vulnerable on social sites , then it would be the ultimate coup for the centre . Despite Facebook 's reassurance it will cooperate with CEOP , it still seems that the site wants to protect its users in its own way .

Facebook execs are set to meet with representatives of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection ( Ceop ) centre in Washington this week to discuss ways of making the online social networking service safer for youngsters . Ceop 's director Jim Gamble said there is an urgent need to discuss the possibility of installing 'panic buttons ' on Facebook , following the recent murder 17-year-old student Ashleigh Hall by Peter Chapman , a man she met via the site . Chapman , 33 , has been jailed for at least 35 years for the killing . Hit the panic button Facebook has previously said that it would not install a panic button on its main pages for users , but it looks like it may well re-consider that view . `` If you 're going to operate a business that encourages people to frequent your public place so that you can advertise to them , then let 's look after them while they 're there , '' said Mr Gamble . Ceop received 252 complaints about Facebook during the first three months of 2010 – 40 per cent of which were about the potential `` grooming '' of children . Via BBC
Gordon Brown , Nick Clegg and David Cameron - the three main political party leaders in the UK - have agreed to take part in digital debates on Facebook and YouTube , causing some commentators to suggest we are seeing the beginning of a new era in digital democracy . Facebook and YouTube users will be able to suggest question on the sites , which can then be voted on by the public.The leaders will then answer the most popular questions . Post video questions Users can post questions in text or video in the categories of economy , health and education , law and order , foreign policy and miscellaneous . The three leaders have pledged to post video responses 10 days before election day . Google 's Director of Communications Peter Barron said : `` Although the televised debates will be a historic first , we feel that that there is an opportunity for a different type of platform that allows voters to be in charge of the questions . `` By collaborating with Facebook to put together one initiative we hope to enable as many voters as possible from across the UK to take part . '' Facebook 's Director of Policy Richard Allan added that : `` The dawn of the digital election this year is a transformative moment for democracy in Britain . By allowing voters to cross-examine their leaders , these digital debates will put the voters firmly in charge . `` This marks a decisive shift away from the constraints of top-down traditional media and will take full advantage of unique scale and reach of Facebook , thus changing the way that politicians campaign for good .

In response to widespread criticism about the complexity of its privacy controls , Facebook has streamlined the system to make it easier for users to protect their personal data online . CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the new privacy settings in a blog and admitted that they had become too complicated and revealed the new methods of ensuring your private data is kept safe this week . Four basic settings Facebook 's 450 million users will be given access to the new privacy controls over the coming weeks . Zuckerberg said in a press conference , and revelaed in a screengrab , that there will be four basic settings : share with 'friends of friends ' , 'friends only , ' 'recommended ' or 'Everyone ' . Recommended shares most of your info across your friends list , but limits sharing of your photos and videos with friends of friends . Facebook cares about privacy `` People think that we do n't care about privacy , but that 's not true , '' Zuckerberg added . `` There 's a balance . More and more people want to share information , and as long as they have good controls over that , I think that 's where the world is going . '' Speaking about Facebook 's policy of sharing data with advertisers , the CEO added : `` The principle is that we do n't give any information to advertisers . We target the ads to people ourselves . Advertisers come to us with adverts that they want shown to particular [ demographic groups of ] people , and we take the ad and show it to the person that we think will be interested in that information . `` So it does n't matter who you 're showing your data to . It does n't matter whether you share it at all . '' The new sharing options are drastically reduced from the six pages of info you had to trawl through before . Facebook is hoping that this 'one-click ' service will finally satisfy users of the site who do n't want their information farmed out to other sites .

The entire England squad will be banned from using Twitter , Facebook or any other social-networking during the World Cup , with the FA noting that they will only air their thoughts via official channels . It seems that Fabio Capello 's team will have to focus on football instead of procrastinating on social sites , which will mean that the players wo n't be able to keep their myriad Twitter followers informed with what 's going on within the England camp . Express yourself Twitter has already got some footballers into hot water with the PFA . Darren Bent , who was prolific on the site until recently , used the micro-blogging service to hit out at Spurs chairman Daniel Levy . He even had his Twitter tag sewn into his boots , but his page has now been closed down . Back in January , Man Utd reportedly issued a similar ban on its players , with all official comment channelled to its website . According to the BBC , it is not just England who are banned from Twitter and the like , Spain has also done the same banning players from using the sites pre-tournament and while the World Cup is on .

Nokia has finally upgraded the N900 to include a large number of updates that helps turn the internet behemoth into a more mainstream phone . Among the highlights of the 1.2 rollout is the integration of Facebook chat to the Nokia N900 , meaning you can talk to your buddies easily without having to enter the main Facebook page . Skype Video calling has also been added , joining the ability to call your friends over VOIP and perhaps helping better quality video calling become mainstream ( after all , Apple is doing it ... ) One handed fun Portrait browsing is also possible , meaning you do n't have to hold the phone in two hands all the time - something that really marked it out against its smartphone peers . Email and calendar functionality has been improved to include enhanced search , better copy and paste and the ability to accept calendar invitations in emails . But in our view the biggest upgrade is to the Ovi Store - those of you out there playing Angry Birds Level One but finding themselves unable to buy more packs will find that the world is now a brighter place thanks to Nokia fixing the Ovi Store . Sadly those of you using older versions of the Maemo OS wo n't be able to access the Ovi Store any more , as Nokia looks to force through this upgrade to everyone - but for Angry Birds alone we think it should be checked out .

Parents of young children can spot an insincere apology from miles away . `` Sorry , '' your tot mumbles , after you find the dog half-shaved and your Xbox full of jam . `` Sorry for what ? '' you 'll say . `` Sorry for shaving the dog and putting jam in your Xbox , '' he 'll say , looking at the floor . But he 's lying . He 's only sorry that he did n't get away with it . Facebook 's much-reported apology in the Washington Post is a bit like that . `` Sorry , '' says Mark Zuckerberg . `` Sorry for what ? '' the internet asks . `` Sorry for invading your privacy and making things confusing and stuff , '' Zuckerberg says . `` Can I have an ice cream now ? '' In his article , Zuckerberg explains the `` principles under which Facebook operates '' . Number one ? `` You have control over how your information is shared '' ; number two , `` We do not share your personal information with people or services you do n't want '' . Number three , `` We do not give advertisers access to your personal information . '' Principles are good things , but only if you stick to them . You have control ? Facebook does n't share with people you do n't want to share with ? Then why did EU regulators warn Facebook earlier this month that its most recent privacy changes , which made private information public by default , were `` unacceptable '' ? Why do we need a stand-alone bit of software to work out what we 're sharing and with whom ? As for not giving advertisers access , here 's a story about , er , Facebook accidentally giving advertisers access to people 's private information . If Facebook really cared about protecting your data , it would make features opt-in , not opt-out : it would say `` here 's your stuff , and we wo n't share it unless you want us to '' rather than `` we 're sharing all your stuff with everyone until and unless you can find the right options to stop us '' . But it wo n't , because the fifth principle Zuckerberg describes - `` We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone '' - means that the only way Facebook 's going to make money is by invading its users ' privacy . Forget Zuckerberg 's claim that Facebook 's mission is about `` giving people the power to share and making the world more open and connected . '' Facebook 's mission is to make money . Facebook is n't sorry . It says it 's sorry , but it is n't sorry . Sure , it 'll come up with tweaked privacy settings to defray criticism , just like it did in December 2009 . And in August 2009 . And in March 2008 . And in December 2007 . But make no mistake . Mark Zuckerberg has his eye on your Xbox , and he 's got jam jars in his hand . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

Twitter and Facebook look to be reining in their involvement with third parties , with both sites announcing restrictions to how third-party networks can use their services . Twitter has made the biggest change , banning third-party ad networks from the site , instead pushing all advertisers to its Promoted Tweets service . This means that nobody except Twitter can add paid tweets into a timeline , effectively banning users from utilising Ad.ly and Sponsored Tweets ( run by Izea ) for monetary gain . Twitter preservation Twitter says on its blog about the announcement : `` It is critical that the core experience of real-time introductions and information is protected for the user and with an eye toward long-term success for all advertisers , users and the Twitter ecosystem . `` For this reason , aside from Promoted Tweets , we will not allow any third party to inject paid tweets into a timeline on any service that leverages the Twitter API . '' The blog continues : `` Third party ad networks are not necessarily looking to preserve the unique user experience Twitter has created . `` They may optimise for either market share or short-term revenue at the expense of the long-term health of the Twitter platform . '' Blocking third parties On the other side of the social-networking coin , it seems that Facebook is making it easier for users to block third-party developers from blurting out information about you . This is all part of the massive privacy shake-up which Facebook is poised to announce . For developers this could mean that wo n't be able to automatically fill up your friends ' walls with posts about how well you are doing on , say , FarmVille . Zuckerberg announced the news in a statement to the Washington Post , which explained : `` We will give you an easy way to turn off all third-party services . We are working hard to make these changes available as soon as possible… `` We already offer controls to limit the visibility of that information and we intend to make them even stronger . '' However Twitter and Facebook sugar-coat this news , it seems that some devs who see both sites as an income source are about to get a little short-changed .
The CEO of Facebook , Mark Zuckerberg , has outlined new privacy policies to make the social-networking site `` a better place '' and right the mistakes made so far . In the candid email to blogger Robert Scoble , he explained that : `` We 've been listening to all the feedback and have been trying to distill [ sic ] it down to the key things we need to improve . `` I 'd like to show an improved product rather than just talk about things we might do . `` We 're going to be ready to start talking about some of the new things we 've built this week . I want to make sure we get this stuff right this time . '' Intentions are in the right place When it comes to privacy , it seems that Zuckerberg holds his hands up , noting : `` I know we 've made a bunch of mistakes , but my hope at the end of this is that the service ends up in a better place and that people understand that our intentions are in the right place and we respond to the feedback from the people we serve . '' Facebook 's biggest problem at the moment is privacy . Zukerberg and co need to radically change people 's opinions of the site and make them want to add content , without the fear that it will end up somewhere else without their consent .

Pakistan has blocked its citizen ’ s access to Facebook because of a competition page on the site that encouraged people to post their drawings of the prophet Muhammad Facebook is now blocked by authorities in Pakistan 'until further notice ' . Public outrage The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority , told internet service providers to block Facebook following a high court order and public outrage over the competition on the site . The Facebook page in question was called ‘ Everybody Draw Mohammad Day — May 20 ’ with over 200 images of the prophet , most of which would be considered blasphemous by Muslims . In one of the pictures , the prophet is depicted with a bearded male face superimposed over a bikini-clad body . Another showed pictures of an airplane crashing into the World Trade Centre with the slogan , “ Islam : a religion of peace . ” The competition page had over 5,000 followers and links to leading critics of Islam . The creator of the page has not been identified . Shakir Husain of Karachi-based net company Creative Chaos said of the ban : `` By banning this web page , it will just make people more curious . It 's pouring petrol on a small fire that could become a lot bigger . `` You ca n't police the internet . The Saudis have tried it , as have other governments , and all have failed . It 's a waste of state money . ''

Facebook has announced a slimmed-down version of its site which is accessible through mobile phones for no extra data charges . Called o.facebook.com , the site is optimised for the mobile format , with a focus on speed , and will allow users to access all the key features found on the existing mobile version of the site . There is one caveat : it is not available in the UK at the moment . However , it is coming out in 45 countries , with 50 mobile operators signed up , so it seems that it will only be a matter of time before it reaches British shores . Discovering mobile internet `` When using the mobile internet , people around the world face two main challenges – sometimes the experience is too slow to be fun and the cost of data plans and understanding them can be daunting , '' explains Facebook about the release . `` We have designed 0.facebook.com to help solve these two barriers and we hope that even more people will discover the mobile internet with Facebook as a result . '' Facebook does note that you will be charged if you leave the site to view photos and the like . So , in short , it 's a place where you will view your friend 's updates , much like Twitter .
Zynga , the owners of FarmVille , have put rumours to rest that the game was leaving Facebook by signing up to a five year strategic partnership with the social-networking site . The agreement shows that Facebook means business when it comes to social gaming and to strengthen its games arm further , the social networker will be expanding the use of the site 's digital money , Facebook Credits . Although it 's not been established who gets what money in the Facebook Credits system , more Zynga games will be using credits in the following months . There was a rumour that Zynga was looking to pull out completely of Facebook and it seemed that Facebook Credits was the sticking point , so it 's no wonder this is a big part of the announcement . Games pioneer Speaking about the link-up , Mark Pincus , founder and chief executive officer at Zynga , said : `` Facebook was a pioneer in opening their platform in 2007 and in just three years tens of millions of Facebook users play our games everyday , from FarmVille and Cafe World to Treasure Isle and Mafia Wars , '' `` We are excited about Facebook 's long-term commitment to social gaming and Zynga , and look forward to working with them and other platform providers to bring the best social gaming experience to users worldwide . '' Last year , Facebook exclusively told TechRadar that FarmVille had more members than micro-blogging site Twitter .
Google 's Larry Page and Eric Schmidt have praised Facebook 's 'Like ' button , explaining that it will help their search engine decide what kind of information people are interested in . Speaking at the Google Zeitgeist conference , Google co-founder Page and CEO Schmidt both spoke about the rise of the 'Like ' button , with the latter believing that this way of sharing content is a 'new phenomenon ' . `` It will probably allow our search to become better , '' said Schmidt , `` because we have more information from people on what matters and what does not matter . `` So…it 's a nice improvement , and it looks to me like there 's going to be a lot of these sort of ideas . `` It 's a new phenomenon and it 's a good one generally . '' Page up Page pointed out that Google already has Buzz tools that offer similar 'like ' functionality , but also sees the move as a key one . `` I think it 's an important area to get lots of feedback from people , '' said Page . `` In [ Google ] Buzz we have a 'Buzz this ' button which is similar to [ Facebook Like ] . `` I think people have been sharing stuff in lots of different way for a long time and that 's clearly a really important signal for a lot of different things . `` I think we have done a pretty good job of harnessing that data so it 's good that there is actually starting to be more and more of that data that 's explicit from users and I think that 's pretty useful in lots of things .

A video attack on Facebook users is luring thousands of thrill seekers into installing malware , falsely offering clickers the 'sexiest video ever ' . According to Sophos , thousands of people have already been caught out by the fairly obvious ploy of offering sexiness on video – in this case a 'candid camera prank ' offering a thumbnail of a woman in a skirt on a bike . When you click on the link you are prompted to install the 'correct video software ' which is , as you probably guessed because you are n't the kind of fool who falls for this , actually an adware installer . Plagued by pop-ups `` You may want to watch a sexy video , but you 're more likely to end up being plagued by pop-up advertising , '' warned Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos . `` Not only is adware being installed on your computer , but the rogue Facebook application is posting the same message to all of your friends ' accounts . `` It 's no surprise that your friends might click to watch the movie when it looks to all intents and purposes that you are the person who has sent it to them . '' So if you did fall for this , not only will you be left fuming at the pop-ups , but you 'll also have propagated the link to all your friends , who will then know you clicked on it in the first place . Embarrassing .

An EU ruling claims that it is unacceptable for Facebook to make people 's profile information public without their prior consent . Facebook has been sent a letter from the European Union 's Data Protection Working Party this week to alert the social networking company of the EU 's concerns . Unacceptable privacy settings The Data Protection Working Party highlights the fact that Facebook 's recent changes make private information publicly viewable by default and is simply `` unacceptable '' . Facebook profiles should be set to a default whereby info is only shared with `` self-selected '' contacts , claims the EU . `` Any further access , such as by search engines , should be an explicit choice of the user… It is unacceptable that [ Facebook ] fundamentally changed the default settings on its social-networking platform to the detriment of users . `` Providers of social networking sites should be aware that it would be a breach of data protection law if they use personal data of other individuals contained in a user profile for commercial purposes if these other individuals have not given their free and unambiguous consent . '' Facebook in a statement , following the EU 's letter : `` We already enable users to exclude themselves from being indexed by search engines , and recently introduced granular data permissions for applications , '' `` We are happy to continue working with the Data Protection Working Party . '' Facebook has over 400 million users worldwide . Via The Telegraph

EA has revealed that it is set to release a new FIFA game , FIFA Superstars on social networking site , Facebook . The game is to be developed by Playfish and will feature multiplayer gameplay through Facebook . EA Sports president Peter Moore explains the idea on his blog , noting that : `` Leveraging our football gaming knowledge and marrying it with the social gaming expertise of our partners at Playfish is sure to provide more great opportunities to bring hundreds of millions of new fans to compete against their friends to win the FIFA World Cup through an engaging interactive football experience . '' Moore promises `` more to come on FIFA Superstars soon '' . Zynga changes the game In the meantime , it looks like Zynga 's hugely popular FarmVille could be pointing the way to a new economic model for games publishers . FarmVille has attracted 78 million active monthly users on Facebook to date . Additionally , Zynga recently announced the private placement of preferred shares which suggest a market valuation of $ 4 billion . Most recently , there are rumours that Zynga may well part company with Facebook and create its very own social-networking service . The Wall Street Journal recently noted that a social videogame like FarmVille may cost in the region of $ 500,000 to $ 1 million to develop , compared with spends from mega-publishers such as Activision of more than $ 20 million to develop traditional $ 50 or $ 60 console games . No wonder that Zynga 's business model is becoming increasingly compelling for the likes of EA Sports and other 'traditional ' videogames publishers .
Google is on the hunt for a social media expert to head up its social strategy , a new job listing reveals this week . Google has still to develop a social networking strategy that appeals to a mass market of casual users , following in the footsteps of recent successes such as Facebook and Twitter . Google is late to social GigaOm was first to obtain the Google letter which outlines the new role , stating : `` This is a new and very strategic position , as Google knows it is late on this front and is appropriately humble about it . `` In Google 's view , conceptually , there are two ways to tackle social , each impacting who may be successful in this senior post : 1 ) building an innovative offering specifically in this area ; or 2 ) developing the capability and integrating social into Google 's existing portfolio . '' Google already has an array of social products from Orkut through to Google Buzz and the social search service Aardvark . Yet there is no clear social strategy , as yet .

Reports suggest that casual game developer Zynga may well have its own plans to leave Facebook in the near future and run its hugely popular games such as FarmVille and Mafia Wars on its own dedicated social network . If Zynga was to launch its own social gaming network , as the report on TechCrunch suggests , then it would be a major blow to Mark Zuckerburg and his team at Facebook . Facebook pushes Zynga Latest reports claim that relations between Zynga and Facebook are at an all-time low , largely down to Facebook 's `` Facebook Credits '' system , which is the only way that independent game makers can get paid via Facebook . The credits system gives 30 per cent of revenue to Facebook , very much like Apple 's own system with the App Store . Facebook is apparently pushing Zynga into signing a new long-term exclusivity deal , which has pushed the issue to the fore . Zynga CEO Mark Pincus has now informed staff to prepare for a the possibility of a split from Facebook and , according to a leaked email , is planning to `` launch a social game network called Zynga Live . '' Facebook told TechCrunch `` we have conversations with our large developers all the time and we do n't typically comment on specific discussions . '' Zynga has so far declined to comment .

Facebook could be set to start the roll out location based features within weeks , according to a major advertising magazine . Advertising Age has reported that Facebook will be integrating location based information and check-ins – highly reminiscent of Foursquare , a company that some analysts have suggested could be an acquisition target for the social network . The report suggests that the likes of restaurant giant McDonalds are already showing interest in the services , and the chance to tap into Facebook 's enormous user base . Although the first signs of the location specific information are almost certainly going to appear in the US first , the UK will not be far behind . No confirmation However , when asked directly about the local features , Faecbook 's Kevin Colleran said : `` We 're still trying to figure out what our strategy is . '' `` When we launch , whatever our product in that space , we will figure it out . '' Of course , the quick rise of location-based services means they were always likely to be something that Facebook would adopt . With a huge social community already heavily engaged in the platform , the prospect of allowing them to bring in local social information and geo-location social games is certainly an exciting one .

Facebook has contacted TechRadar regarding the news that its privacy settings allowed users to see their friends ' friend requests and other sensitive information . In a statement , the social-networking giant says that : `` For a limited period of time , a bug permitted some users ' chat messages and pending friend requests to be made visible to their friends by manipulating the 'preview my profile ' feature of Facebook privacy settings . `` When we received reports of the problem , our engineers promptly diagnosed it and temporarily disabled the chat function . We also pushed out a fix to take care of the visible friend requests which is now complete . '' Quick resolution TechCrunch were the first to flag up the privacy loophole . Soon after the article went up , Facebook suspended its Chat facility . While this function is still currently down , Facebook has said that `` Chat will be turned back on across the site shortly . '' Although there is no actual apology for the `` bug '' , Facebook is noting that it fixed the problem as fast as it could , explaining : `` We worked quickly to resolve this matter , ensuring that once the bug was reported to us , a solution was quickly found and implemented . ''
A massive security flaw has been found on Facebook , which allows users to see personal information about their friends , including friend requests and more . The flaw was found by TechCruch who have posted a video of just how to see other people 's information without doing any hacking . Privacy problem It seems there is a loophole in the security preferences of the site , in the section where you can preview security changes you have made and see what your profile looks like to other people . Once you do this , a simple refresh allows you to see sensitive information of that person , and even their chat windows if they have been left open . There has been no statement as of yet from Facebook , but Chat is currently disabled on the site . TechRadar has tried out the flaw on willing participants and it does seem legit . We saw the pending friend requests of our friends and were told how many notifications they had . Facebook has been very public about its privacy changes – changes which have not been popular with the public . Although this privacy loophole is likely to be closed sharpish , the consequences of such an oversight may be far reaching . TechRadar has contacted Facebook for comment .

Facebook users have decided that Nick Clegg , the leader of the Liberal Democrats , is the best bet to be the new Prime Minister , with a whopping 42 per cent of a vote conducted on the social-networking site . A poll was conducted via Facebook 's Democracy UK page , which brought in nearly 500,000 users ' opinions , and saw 42 % opt for Clegg compared to only 31 % for David Cameron ( Conservatives ) and 27 % for Gordon Brown ( Labour ) . Compared to a month ago , the Lib Dems currency has gone up considerably when they were only ranking with 19 per cent of the vote in a parallel poll . Huge surge in engagement Facebook 's poll was definitely one which echoes what today 's youth is thinking about politics – as three-fifths of those voting were under the age of 35 . Speaking about the poll , Richard Allan , Facebook 's Director of Public Policy for Europe said : `` We have seen a huge surge in engagement on Facebook with thousands of political groups and pages being set up , with some attracting hundreds of thousands of users – including Facebook 's own Democracy UK page . `` Whatever the outcome of the election , the level of engagement we have witnessed both on Facebook and beyond is hugely positive for the health of our democracy .

Google , it seems , is about to announce a Facebook competitor : Google Me . If you 're thinking we 've been here before , you 're right : Google dipped its toes in the social networking water when it acquired Orkut , and when it made a mess of launching Buzz . Third time lucky ? Maybe ! Here 's how Google can win a social networking war . Improve Google Profiles Profiles feels half-finished at the moment , with half-hearted social network integration and a bit of Reader article sharing . They could be much more useful , integrating all your social activities in a profile that turns up at the top of search results when you Google somebody 's name . Build Buzz into Google Me Buzz suffered a PR nightmare , but as a tool it 's quite nifty and a credible rival to Facebook 's News Feed and Twitter 's status updates – and unlike Facebook , you do n't need someone 's permission to follow them . It 's also got 200 million potential users in the form of Gmail account holders . Give Google Me a Brazilian Millions of Brazilians , in fact : Orkut is a huge deal in Brazil and in India , which just happen to be two of the BRIC ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) nations where pundits expect serious growth of online services . BRIC nations are a key target for Facebook ( and other big firms , such as Yahoo ) , and with Orkut Google already has some impressive numbers . Whatever it does needs to work inside Orkut or be so appealing that Orkut users will migrate . Make the Mafia an offer they ca n't refuse Well , the creators of Mafia Wars , and Farmville , and all the other apps that pollute our Facebook feeds : they might be annoying , but in traffic terms they 're stickier than Sticky Mick The Sticky Stick . Link in Latitude When you think about it , Google has all the things you might want a social network to do . Location awareness ? Latitude . Photo sharing ? Picasa . Video ? YouTube . Document sharing ? Docs . And so on . Become friends with Begbie Remember Begbie , the moustachioed psychopath from Trainspotting ? He 's the embodiment of `` with friends like these , who needs enemies ? '' One of the reasons Buzz went so wrong was that Googlers do n't seem to have crazy people like that in their past or present , so they do n't need to worry about privacy too much . Everyone involved in Google 's social network activities should be issued with a full complement of bunny-boiling exes , nosey bosses , boggle-eyed stalkers and flat-out nutcases so they understand the importance of privacy controls . Go on about openness Google could make the anti-Facebook , with sharing controls that are opt-in rather than opt-out , the ability to delete your data easily and permanently and the ability to export some or all of your posted items to your computer or to other online services . And then it could go on and on and on about it . It 's a strategy that 's already worked for the firm : even your Gran probably knows that Android is a more open platform than Apple 's iOS . Hire people to make Google Me look nice Google stuff is clever . It 's rarely pretty . Hide Eric Schmidt Whether taken out of context or not , Eric Schmidt 's `` if you 've something to hide , do n't do it online '' comments to CNBC do n't exactly make you want to give him all your personal data . Particularly when he looks like he owns pants made from human skin .

David Fincher 's upcoming movie about Facebook has got its first trailer , and it 's actually pretty good . The Social Network is a movie that takes its inspiration from the early years of Facebook and while it is not based on the Facebook 'tell-all ' book The Accidental Billionaires , author Ben Mezrich was one of the writers of the movie . Being social The main writing credit , though , goes to Aaron Sorkin – who penned A Few Good Men and the West Wing . Expect lots of `` you ca n't handle the truth moments , '' then . The story of how Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg became one of the USA 's richest men is a short but impressive one . And the trailer for the movie hints at the perils overnight success brings . As Zuckerberg has had absolutely no involvement with the production , though , this will be one movie which is unlikely to get a big Like from the social network . To see what all the fuss is about , check out the trailer below .

Facebook execs flocked to London this week to promote the social-network 's first Developer Garage in the UK . While they were there they confirmed just how many people in the UK use Facebook . The answer : a cool 26 million . Considering the UK population is around 61 million , this means more than a third of the UK whiles away its hours on the site . In celebration of this number TechRadar , who was at the Developer Conference , has decided to do a bit of number-crunching regarding the biggest social-networking site in the world . So , for your reading pleasure , here are the numbers which make Facebook tick . This is how many people worked on the Facebook Chat service until very recently . As Zuckerberg said at the event : `` Our IM network is maybe the second largest in the world and we have like one guy working on it . '' The amount of people who now look after Facebook chat , as of this week . The number of Downing Street Mark Zuckerberg visited while in London . He spoke to Prime Minister David Cameron about opening up government data apparently . The original amount of partners for Facebook 's recently announced social plug-ins platform , which uses simplified code to make it easier to add Facebook integration to external sites . Two-and-a-half months later there are now hundreds of thousands of sites using this code . The average amount of 'friends ' a person has on Facebook . The cap for how many friends you can have on Facebook . The reason , according to Zuckerberg : `` Most people do n't have 5,000 friends in real life . '' The amount of websites in the UK which have used Facebook 's social graph plug-in so far , which brings the Facebook Like button to third-party sites . The amount of sites worldwide that have adopted the Facebook social graph plug-in . The amount of playbacks the Nike Write Your Future advert got on Facebook in 24hrs when it was first posted . The amount of people play games from developer King.com , who owns Tetris and Bejewelled for Facebook . The amount of 'Likes ' that have been clocked up since Facebook lanched its social plug-ins service . The amount of people who play games on Facebook . A mere 24 different games have more than 10 million views on Facebook a month . The amount of games played by the 25 million users of King.com in a month . As for percentages ... The amount of people using the new Facebook integration on BBC iPlayer 3 . The BBC iPlayer 3 beta has been available for less than a month and currently 8 per cent of those using iPlayer are using the beta version . The amount of Facebook users that come from outside the US . The UK accounts for 26 million , Spain and Germany account for 10 million each , while France has 15 million users and Italy has 16 million . The amount of status updates on 12 June which were about the World Cup .

UPDATE Zuckerberg has spoken a bit more about meeting the Prime Minister today , saying `` David Cameron seems very insightful . A lot of the stuff we talked about was openng up Government data . '' He also noted : `` At the hackthon I visited this week in London it was amazing how many devs were working on civic projects , like taking information about the tube and creating new services . `` I mentioned that to the staff at Number 10 Downing [ sic ] and they were really excited about wanting to open up data and are excited about what can be done . '' ORIGINAL STORY Jeremy Hunt , the Secretary of State for the Department of Culture , Media and Sport , met up with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg today at Number 10 , with the Prime Minister popping in to say hello . Zuckerberg , who is visiting London for the Facebook Developer Garage , met up with Hunt who used Twitter to say that he had met with the Facebook boss , noting `` Just met Mark Zuckerberg , Founder of Facebook . Really smart guy with some good ideas on improvement digital engagement in policy making . '' News at 10 At a roundtable with TechRadar in attendance , a Facebook spokesperson announced that a meeting did indeed take place , but could not say what was said . The spokesperson also said that the Prime Minister did `` pop in '' . Facebook is trying to push the social side of Facebook and it will be interesting to see if something comes out of the meeting . We have no idea why Facebook is being so tight-lipped about the meet-up but it just shows how popular the site is if its CEO can get face-time with the Prime Minister .
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg made a rare visit to London this week , introducing the UK Facebook Developers Garage and discussing his thoughts about what makes Facebook so popular . In his brief and thankfully sweat-free speech , Zuckerberg told a packed audience , with TechRadar in attendance , that Europe was a significant part of a site which he believes is one of the most engaging out there . `` It is a really exciting time to get information , '' notes Zuckerberg . `` What we have seen is the Facebook web application is the most engaging website ever built because it has been made for people . `` We are at a pretty interesting point in the world . The world is becoming more and more open . Google came out when I was at middle school . Before that there was AOL , then Napster with all the music you wanted . `` Then you could look at everything on Wikipedia and finally Facebook brought social to the web . '' When it comes to Europe , Zuckerberg noted that it is European developers who are using Facebook 's social plug-ins , explaining that its take-up has been massive outside of America . `` Already 300,000 sites use our Like plug-in and social APIs , with 50 per cent coming from Europe . `` The social graph means that all developers can easily add social tools to their sites . The graph API meant that we completely re-did the core programme , it is a lot easier to use , it is a lot faster . '' Social web Zuckerberg noted in his speech that he wants all websites to be social and he believes Facebook has the tools to do this and that is why Zuckerberg is giving these tools to developers for free . `` We realised early on that we could n't develop all the social things we wanted , so we started the API platform so developers can build the next generation of applications . `` Social gaming has interrupted the games industry , making us the biggest gaming platform in the world . `` The new version of Spotify is fundamentally social and is pretty amazing , it adds a new level to the experience that is completely different from what was before . `` Every industry is going to go through a wave of social development . It is not just music and games . Most of what people do on the web is n't on Facebook , it is n't on any one website . All the websites you use are based on structured data but there has n't been any way for websites to utilise this . Facebook is trying to do this . ''

Facebook made a cool $ 800 million in 2009 , twice the amount of money it made in 2008 . It is considerably more money than was predicted by some of Facebook 's own board members and a number of industry analysts . It also means that , for the first time , the leading online social network has turned a profit . Advertisers and userbase growth Over the last year , the number of advertisers on Facebook has increased by 400 per cent and the number of users has swelled to nearly half a billion worldwide . The latest news on Facebook 's record financial results comes from Reuters , citing `` two sources familiar with the situation '' to confirm Facebook 's 2009 revenues . While we await official confirmation from Mark Zuckerburg 's accountants , it is clear that the massive growth in the company 's revenues is an indicator of how it plans to develop as an advertising sales platform . `` They are downplaying their performance , '' one unnamed source told Reuters . `` There 's no upside in getting people 's expectations high , it 's always better to go low .

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg says e-mail may soon become obsolete , following the demise of the written letter and the telegram . Speaking at the Nielsen Consumer 360 conference this week , Sanberg told the audience how teenagers are using email less and less and how she expects it will soon die out . Watch what teens do with tech Sandberg told the crowd : `` I hate to be the bearer of bad news but in consumer technology , if you want to know what people like us will do tomorrow , you look at what teenagers are doing today . `` And the latest figures say that only 11 percent of teenagers e-mail daily . So e-mail — I ca n't imagine life without it — is probably going away . So what do teenagers do ? They SMS and increasingly , they use social networking . '' Sandberg did n't cite any more in-depth figures or research on the matter , but the fact that she is COO of Facebook , who presumably know more than most companies how teenagers operate online , is certainly reason enough to take her words seriously .

Yahoo users will be treated to a bunch of new features offering them easier access to their updates on Facebook , with the two web giants ' announcing the latest plans in their partnership deal . Starting this week , Yahoo users can now opt to have a Facebook newsfeed delivered to their homepage or Yahoo email . The move is clearly an attempt on Yahoo 's part to stop its aging , and slightly less 'tech savvy ' users spending more of their time online over at Facebook . Sharing holiday snaps It will now also be easier to share your information and photos uploaded to various Yahoo sites , such as your holiday snaps on Yahoo 's Flickr with your pals and family members on Facebook . The latest moves are part of a wide-ranging partnership deal between Yahoo and Facebook , originally announced back in 2009 . Yahoo is also set to rename Yahoo Profiles to Yahoo Pulse and , following Facebook 's recent lead , improve the overall privacy features on its sites . Facebook 's latest improvements to the privacy settings for its users were seen by many as a response to a recent spate of negative PR surrounding the social networking site 's attitudes to data protection .

Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Facebook , took to the stage at the All Things Digital D8 conference this week to have his say on the site 's privacy debate . A rather sweaty Zuckerberg – it must be hot under those convention lights – tried to explain Facebook 's reasoning about privacy , explaining : `` Privacy is very important to us . I think there are some misperceptions . People use Facebook to share and to stay connected . `` You do n't start off on Facebook being connected to your friends , you 've got to be able to find them . So having some information available broadly is good for that . `` Now , there have been misperceptions that we 're trying to make all information open , but that 's false . We encourage people to keep their most private information private . But some of the most basic information , we suggest that people leave public . '' Social serendipity When asked why people have to actually make steps to protect their privacy on the site , he explained rather cryptically that it 's all about `` serendipitous connections '' . As for the backlash the site is getting , Zuckerberg noted : `` I started building this when I was around 19 years old , and along the way , a lot of stuff changed . We went from building a service in a dorm room to running a service that 500 million people use . '' During the interview Zuckerberg apparently looked so sweaty that his interviewee asked him to take his hoody off , saying : `` You all right ? We 're not even yelling at you… yet . '' In its live blog , All Things Digital said , jokingly , that this could be Zuckerberg 's `` Nixon moment '' . Compared to Steve Jobs ' interview at the conference , Zuckerberg was a lot less polished , although he did manage to throw a joke in , saying : `` One of the things I try to do as CEO of this company is not make mistakes that other companies make . I make different ones . '' Never a truer word said… Via All Things Digital

Facebook has a new service , Facebook Questions . As the firms ' Blake Ross explains , `` Millions of people ask their friends questions on Facebook every day . What new music should I listen to ? Where 's the best sushi place in town ? How do I learn to play the piano ? How can I give my valuable time and knowledge to help an enormous , vaguely creepy corporation make money that it wo n't share with me ? '' I made that last question up . Maybe I should post it on Facebook . One question I do n't need to ask is : what on Earth is Facebook up to now ? It 's obvious : it 's another Facebook land grab , another attempt by everyone 's favourite sinister social network to take something that exists on the open internet and bring it inside Facebook 's reinforced walls . There are already stacks of Q & A sites online - Ask Metafilter , Yahoo Answers , Quora , Ask.com and many , many more - but none of those sites are Facebook . Time spent on those sites is time you 're not spending on Facebook , and when that happens Facebook makes a sad face . By `` sad face '' , of course , I mean `` attempts to clone those sites in the hope it can do to their business what a Terminator would like to do to Sarah Connor '' . Like Google and Microsoft before it , Facebook 's sheer scale means that when it decides to compete in a new sector , the resulting competition is a bit like a fist-fight between Soviet Russia and an eight-year-old girl . Content for nothing Facebook has half a billion users , and even if only the tiniest percentage of users contribute answers , and even if only the tiniest percentage of those users are n't complete and utter imbeciles - which , to be fair , is a pretty big if - then Facebook will end up with an enormous amount of Q & A content . Unlike the `` demonic '' content farms who are often pilloried for paying a pittance and stuffing the web with search engine bait , Facebook seems to think a pittance is far too generous . The answers wo n't cost Facebook a penny , but collectively they could bring in enormous amounts of traffic that Facebook can throw targeted ads at . It 's a simple enough plan : make every single link on Google point to a Facebook page . Where 's the best place to buy a T-31 Modulator ? Ask Facebook . What 's the best time of year to go turtle punching ? Ask Facebook . How can I tell if I have a horrible bum disease ? Ask Facebook . Have we always been at war with Eurasia ? Ask Facebook . Matt Haughey created MetaFilter , one of the smartest websites on the entire internet . In a recent interview , he put it like this : `` Facebook 's coming at it from a corporate position . It 's basically like AOL in 1997 - everything is there and there 's no need to go anywhere else . I do n't know if they 're even considering what users want anymore . It 's all about how to maximize revenue and all that crap . '' Still , it 's not all bad . Dumbasses only have so much free time , so let 's make sure we encourage them to spend all their time posting and answering on Facebook . By making Facebook into an idiot magnet , magically drawing all the droolers to its warm embrace , that 'll keep the other Q & A sites idiot-free . Hurrah for Facebook !
Facebook has unveiled Facebook Questions , with the beta functionality offering its users the opportunity to poll the wisdom of the Facebook community . Facebook 's mighty reach means that Facebook Questions could well prove to be a major hit , despite rivalry from internet sites like Yahoo Answers or the search engine Ask . `` Millions of people ask their friends questions on Facebook every day . What new music should I listen to ? Where 's the best sushi place in town ? How do I learn to play the piano ? '' explains Facebook 's release . Beta arrival `` Today we 're introducing Facebook Questions , a beta product that lets you pose questions like these to the Facebook community , '' it continues . `` With this new application , you can get a broader set of answers and learn valuable information from people knowledgeable on a range of topics . `` Since we like to develop products carefully over time with your help , Facebook Questions is available to a limited number of people right now , and we 'll be developing it rapidly based on their feedback . `` We 're aiming to bring this product to all of you as quickly as we can . '' 'Ask question ' If you happen to be one of those granted access to Facebook Questions you can participate simply by hitting the 'Ask question ' button at the top of the screen - you can add a poll or photo . `` To help us show your question to the most relevant people and ensure the best answers , you can tag it with a specific topic , '' adds Facebook . `` For instance , if you have a question about what type of camera you should buy , you could tag it with `` Photography . '' If you want to find the best bike routes in the area , you might tag it with `` Cycling . '' `` The questions you ask will be shown to people who have expressed interest in the particular topics you tag , as well as to your friends and friends of friends . ''
A white hat hacker has announced on his blog that he 's taken advantage of Facebook 's muddled privacy settings by putting 100 million people 's details on BitTorrent site Pirate Bay . While there have been various media reports that this was private data made public , this according to Facebook was n't the case , more an aggregation of publicly available information that 's free for all to view at the moment . `` People who use Facebook own their information and have the right to share only what they want , with whom they want , and when they want , '' noted Facebook 's statement . `` In this case , information that people have agreed to make public was collected by a single researcher and already exists in Google , Bing , other search engines , as well as on Facebook . `` No private data is available or has been compromised . '' Data mined The 'hacker ' is security consultant Ron Bowles who took publicly available data – user IDs , names , URLs and other information – and created a 2.8GB file for all to download from Pirate Bay . While this was n't a breach of privacy , by collating a mountain of data that is freely available about members of Facebook Bowles has shown just how much information users do allow Google and the like to aggregate . But the fact of the matter remains : If your details are in the file , then your privacy settings are , or were until recently , set to public .

Mark Zuckerberg was recently quoted as saying Facebook `` was almost a guarantee '' to hit 1 billion worldwide users . With a current user base topping 500 million , and a market leading presence in all but four countries worldwide , this statement is anything but hyperbole . What is more , its implications are simply huge . Facebook provides a wide range of services to its userbase ; for all the hype Farmville is but one of them . At its most basic Facebook is a communications tool . It lets Person A contact Person B . With 1 billion users this simple premise becomes something else entirely . With 1 billion people you can be sure the person you are looking for is on Facebook . If they are n't then they are n't on the internet full stop . The traction that 1 billion users would provide would quickly suck in those who had resisted creating accounts so far . You would almost need to create an account for fear of being left out in the cold . So why bother with Gmail or Yahoo chat ? Your friends , parents , and partner are on Facebook , so it 's simply easier to do everything within the same friendly blue landscape . All Facebook needs to do is add VOIP and video chat to its , still occasionally flaky , text chat service and it becomes an all encompassing communications tool . No need for separate accounts , separate directories , and different protocols . It sounds far fetched , but is it really ? The , totally unscientific , poll I conducted in the office showed that all concerned felt Facebook messaging had replaced email for personal use to some degree . The more users in the Facebook fold , the more persuasive this argument becomes . The downside So what 's the harm ? Well , we have already seen Facebook 's slightly slipshod handling of people 's privacy . How well can it be trusted with all of your emails ? I 'm sure it could find lots of juicy data in there for the marketing firms . Even more worryingly Facebook is closed shop to all intents and purposes . Getting a backup of your data is n't easy . You may be relying on Microsoft or Google to look after your email , but this feels significantly more reliable than Facebook . Then there is the issue of Facebook making money . Nothing is to say it wo n't start charging for some of its services . 10 pence an email ? Sounds unlikely , I know , but with a captive audience of 1 billion and all those servers to pay for who knows . Social proof But generating revenue is a serious area for Facebook . Attempts to harness the business benefits of social media , with its 'Beacon ' advertising system , did n't go well . To sum up , this advertising system collected data from external websites , sites users had visited or purchased from , and used this information within Facebook . Adverts could be targeted at users more precisely using the collected data , and related/relevant events posted to users ' walls . But the system was a huge failure as privacy concerns engulfed the concept and ultimately led to it being pulled . People just did n't like having their activities monitored in this way , even when they had opted or even logged out of Facebook . Facebook had much more success with its 'fan page ' functionality . This built on the existing 'groups ' idea and allowed users to create 'fan ' pages for products , companies , people , in fact pretty much anything they choose . These pages are public , contain links , and allow updates to be sent out to 'fans ' . Agencies can create fan pages for products , services , or clients for free and encourage their use and uptake . But most importantly of all fan pages make use of a hugely important aspect of social media - friends and networks . And with a billion users or more that is a lot of friends , and some very healthy networks . If my friend joins a fan page I 'm inclined to do the same . If someone I trust is discussing a service or product , then I may take a look . If someone in my network does the same I 'd also pay attention , more than I would to a simple advert - that is the power of 'social proof ' or 'following the crowd ' in cruder terms . Crowdsourcing This idea of social proof leads us to that mainstay of social networking - crowd-sourcing . Wikipedia defines crowd sourcing as `` delegating a task to a large diffuse group '' . This has been demonstrated most recently by the UK government , who have setup a Facebook page asking users to suggest ideas for spending cuts . Whilst many would argue this is nothing more than a publicity stunt , and simply the modern equivalent of being stopped in the street by a man with a clipboard , it 's difficult not to worry about the Government of a sovereign nation using social networking to generate policy . This is an extreme example , but if ever the `` wisdom of crowds '' was ever to be fully tested , the 1 billion users of Facebook seem like good candidates ' . Let 's just hope we do n't lose sight of individual innovation and free thinking - that is , after all , what gave us our favorite social networking site in the first place .
The founder of Facebook , Mark Zuckerberg , is to feature in The Simpsons . The US hit show has been animating guest stars for years , and Zuckerberg is now considered to be important enough to follow in the footsteps of Simon Cowell , Aerosmith and Stephen Hawking . Apparently , the 26-year-old billionaire will meet Lisa at convention of entrepreneurs and give advice on how to run a Nelson 's bicycle company . The episode will air in October in the US . 15 and a bit minutes Zuckerberg will have to get used to seeing an aproxomation of his face on screen , with an unofficial film of his foundation of Facebook set to arrive in cinemas . The film is called The Social Network , and is directed by David Fincher , but Zuckerberg is not keen on the concept . `` As an example of fiction , they wrote the movie and said that I was creating Facebook to get girls , '' he said . `` But I 've been dating the same girl since even before Facebook .

Flying in the face of everything that 's good and lovely about the world , Facebook has hit the 500 million user mark - and it 's so popular Hollywood is making a movie , The Social Network , about it . You may have heard about it , partly because there 's a trailer for it before showings of Inception and partly because every time you mention social networking online right now someone from a street team pops up and says `` OMG THE SOCIAL NETWORK TRAILER IS AWESOME '' . Unless reviews talk about The Social Network 's Seven-style horrors it 's safe to say we probably wo n't be going to see it , but it 's got us wondering : what would the film versions of other sites and services be like ? Twitter With a cast of 140 characters including Stephen Fry , Stephen Fry and Stephen Fry , the Twitter movie is bound to be a success - but will the projectors be able to stay working for an entire showing ? No ! Google Two and a half hours of adverts and pictures of kittens punctuated at random intervals by a man screaming `` WE KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE ! WE KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE !

Facebook has announced it has crossed 500m active users – six years after it was first launched . That number comes after it reached 400m active users in February , showing that the social networking site is not slowing down in terms of popularity . To celebrate , Facebook Stories is being launched – which is basically a chance for users to write just how great Facebook is and the impact it 's had on their lives . Needless to say , those that made the front page are a touch sycophantic to say the least , but it does have a cool interactive map to see the stories by location . Facebook has also posted a wall of thanks from its employees – which is cool simply because it uses a neat '3D ' interface to scan through . Facebook is no longer cool CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to the stage at the Computer History Museum in the US to talk about the new numbers , he said that the site has grown beyond the premise of other social networks because it 's no longer 'cool ' : `` Think about MySpace . People used it because it was cool and fun . People ask what 's going to happen when Facebook is n't cool anymore . But I 'm not here to build something cool . `` We 're here to build something useful . Something that 's cool can fade . But something that 's useful wo n't . '' Zuckerberg also stated that Facebook may have made 'some mistakes ' regarding privacy settings , but said that changes are still in the pipeline , with things like being able to offer certain privacy settings to certain groups of friends a possibility .

Sophos has produced a video showing how hundreds of users are falling for dodgy Facebook links that say 'OMG mother went to jail ' . Sophos has detailed how people are falling for the latest scam , which tricks users into Facebook Liking a page , adding a link to it on their wall and then being hit with a fake survey . `` I really feel like despairing that the general public will ever learn to avoid dodgy links like this , '' said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos .

'' Users who have been affected should view their profile , click on the 'Info ' tab and remove any of the offending pages from the `` Likes and interests '' section . Obviously . In reality , the people who read this article are n't really the people who will fall for this scam , but check out the video and see how the other half live .

Coca-Cola has been forced to pull a Dr Pepper campaign from social network Facebook , after a 14-year-old girl 's status was changed to reference a pornographic film . Mumsnet – the community for parents – highlighted the problem , after the girl 's mother noticed that her girl had Googled the film to find out what the reference was to . According to the Guardian , Coca-Cola has launched an investigation into the incident . Dr Pepper A spokesman said : `` It has been brought to our attention that the Dr Pepper promotion on Facebook posted an offensive status update . We apologise for any offence caused . '' `` As soon as we became aware of this , we took immediate action and removed the status update from the application . `` We have also taken the decision to end the promotion . We will take all steps necessary to ensure this does not happen again '' . This will , no doubt , serve as a note of caution for big businesses looking to social networks to launch ad campaigns .

Facebook went against the wishes of Prime Minister David Cameron this week by deciding to keep a fan page dedicated to killer Raoul Moat on the site . This in itself was the right thing to do . Whatever your opinion of the situation , Facebook was completely within its rights to keep the page up unless its terms have been violated . It 's not as if Facebook was forcing its users to become a fan , like it has n't been forcing people to become a fan of the Hitler Rocks ! ! ! fan page either . Of course , Cameron disagreed and in his Prime Minister 's questions he spoke of his dismay of the online tributes , saying he `` can not understand any wave , however small , of public sympathy for this man '' . In a statement the social-networking site explained its stance , noting : `` We have 26 million people on Facebook in the UK , each of which has their own opinion , and they are entitled to express their views on Facebook as long as their comments do not violate our terms . `` We believe that enabling people to have these different opinions and debate about a topic can help bring together lots of different views for a healthy discussion . '' Technology to blame This Facebook fracas is the very tip of the Raoul Moat media iceberg . The stand-off between Moat and Northumbria police was a very public affair , with 24-hour news outlets Sky News and BBC News relaying live every little bit of detail about the case . Debating the media attention the case got , Mark Lawson writing in the Guardian , noted that is was because of technology we are now getting rolling media coverage on events such as this . `` Has the equation between broadcasting technique and editorial importance gone wrong ? Brutally judged , Moat was a local crime story that would once never have claimed national attention on this scale , '' he explains . `` The BBC and ITV were perhaps worried about losing viewers to Sky News , which was mad for Moat , but the suspicion remains that they covered the story like this because , technologically , they now can . Yes , but should they ? '' Trending topics The media frenzy is something which has spilled over on to the web , with Raoul Moat becoming a trending topic on Twitter on numerous occasions and sites like YouTube awash with videos regarding the killer . In one particular YouTube post , late night radio host Ian Collins speaks to the creator of the Facebook fan page , who calls Moat `` a legend for giving the police the run around '' . He retorts by asking his audience : `` is that the stupidest woman you have ever heard on this radio show '' . The less said about the interview with Raoul Moat 's 'friend ' Paul Gasgoine the better . Freedom of speech It 's not just Facebook who has 'problems ' with Raul Moat fans . A quick search on MySpace shows that Moat has his own page on the site , something which was put up nearly a week after his death . The right to say what you want is something the UK prides itself on , whether it 's is ill-judged or not . While the Facebook page that caused the controversy has now disappeared , it was n't Facebook who took it down but its creator . As the site told TechRadar : `` Facebook did not remove the 'RIP Raoul Moat you Legend ' Page . Facebook will remove content that violates our terms when reported to us . '' `` Any content on Facebook can be removed by the user who created it . For example if you upload a photo , you have the right to remove that at any time . '' And there are still many similar pages on the site . The internet has always had a inherent lack of opinion when it comes to sensitive issues . The mere fact that there is a Raoul Moat meme generator doing the rounds shows that regardless of how despicable the acts are that someone does , the web will find a way to make it into entertainment .

Facebook is no stranger to posting big numbers but its latest stats for those who check Facebook on a mobile phone are more-than impressive . At the MobileBeat 2010 conference in San Francisco , Eric Tseng , head of mobile products at Facebook , revealed that there are now 150 million people who log on to the site from their phones , up 50 million in just three months . Growth lever The social-network site knows the importance of on-the-go Facebook checking and is calling it the key platform for the future , with Tseng explaining : `` Mobile is fast becoming our growth lever '' and that in just six months the mobile platform should `` catch-up '' with its PC counterpart . If it does , then the growth will be phenomenal , considering Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook has around 500 million members overall . In June , Facebook told TechRadar that it now has 26 million members in the UK , which equates to more than a third of the population . Via MacWorld

As announced in February , Microsoft Outlook now allows users to integrate their Facebook accounts and view contacts ' photos , news feeds and status updates with an add-on to Social Connector . Microsoft states that : `` According to the Nielsen ratings , 67 per cent of the global online population now goes online to visit social networks and blogs to stay connected , make decisions , and get things done . Today 's news demonstrates our commitment to evolving Office to support the way you get things done . '' LinkedIn and MySpace became available in Social Connector over the winter , and this week Facebook and Windows Live were also added . Convenience Instead of offering up its own social network , Microsoft is keen to promote the convenience of mixing users ' Outlook inbox with their social networks , such as Facebook and MySpace . Microsoft has also released a new version of the Outlook Social Connector , giving users the ability to receive real-time updates in the 'People Pane ' within Outlook . With regard to privacy , Microsoft have said that the user decides what information they share , and with who . Back in April Microsoft announced Live Messenger 9 , which allowed users to share their status updates with all of their social networks . Today 's Outlook update promises similar integration with our inboxes , too . Via BBC
Figures released by eMarketer for April reveal that a startling 29 per cent of teenage Facebook users left the site , or used it less , during the month . A further nine per cent of teens admitted to abandoning the social network completely , although this is some way behind MySpace 's abandonment rate of 22 per cent . The most popular reason for leaving , accounting for 45 per cent of teens aged 13 to 17 , was that it 's become boring , or they 've lost interest in the site . Being given too many notifications ranked in third place with 27 per cent , while 16 per cent left because their parents joined . Shared Information Interestingly , privacy was not a popular issue among teenage users , with just 13 per cent being uncomfortable with their information being shared and 12 per cent disliking changes implemented by Facebook . The eMarkter report found that social gaming is big news for teenagers , with 73 per cent playing social games online , and 81 per cent of teens playing games on Facebook .
A New Yorker who designed the original website for Mark Zuckerberg that eventually grew into Facebook has claimed that he owns 84 per cent of the company . Facebook is fighting Paul Ceglia 's claims in court , overturning a New York judge 's recent order to temporarily block any transfer of the company 's assets . Web designer Ceglia said he signed a contract with Facebook 's Mark Zuckerberg back in 2003 to design a site , for which he was paid a $ 1,000 fee and a 50 per cent stake in the company , originally launched as thefacebook.com . That contract also said Ceglia `` would acquire an additional 1 per cent interest in the business , per day , until the website was completed . '' Completely frivolous Ceglia is now claiming that by February 4 , 2004 , his stake in Facebook was 84 per cent . For its part , Facebook has said the lawsuit is 'completely frivolous ' . Reuters notes in December 2009 , New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo obtained a temporary restraining order against a wood-pellet fuel company owned by Ceglia , following allegations that Allegany Pellets took $ 200,000 from customers without delivering anything in return or giving them refunds . Stay tuned for updates on Ceglia vs. Zuckerberg & Facebook as and when we get them . Via Reuters

Facebook is set to launch a new initiative with the UK 's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre to give all of its users potential access to CEOP 's advice and services , in a move set to appease critics . CEOP is the government law enforcement agency that tracks down online sex offenders . It has been in negotiations with Facebook over the installation of a 'panic button ' for users since late last year . ClickCEOP app launches The latest initiative with CEOP will provide users with a Facebook app which is very similar to such a panic button , although users will have to install the app by choice . A ClickCeop button added to your Facebook will then give younger users the option of reporting suspected inappropriate behaviour from others they encounter on the site . `` Our dialogue with Facebook about adopting the ClickCeop button is well documented , '' said Jim Gamble , the chief executive of CEOP in a statement . `` Today , however , is a good day for child protection . '' Online child safety awareness Facebook plans to run an awareness campaign online to promote the ClickCEOP button , with an automatic advert set to appear on every homepage of users aged between 13 to 18 . `` We know from speaking to offenders that a visible deterrent could protect young people online , '' said Joanna Shields , vice president of Facebook for Europe , Middle East and Africa . `` There is no single silver bullet to making the Internet safer but by joining forces with Ceop we have developed a comprehensive solution ... and backed this with an awareness campaign to publicise it to young users . '' Facebook 's head of communications in the UK , Sophy Silver , told BBC News that both CEOP and Facebook were `` happy of where we have got to . '' The Facebook PR added : `` We still have the Facebook reporting system and by having a pre-packaged application that users play an active part in , you not only help keep them safe , it makes all of their friends aware too , and acts as a viral awareness campaign . `` Ultimately though , this makes for a safer environment for users and that 's the most important part .

Facebook has announced the end of its virtual gift shop , revealing that it will close for business next month . The social-network giant has made a pretty penny from its virtual gifts ( around $ 100 million since its launch in 2007 ) so it is interesting that it has decided to get rid of the service so that it can `` focus instead on improving other products '' . This does n't mean that you wo n't see virtual gifts from appearing on the site anymore , as Facebook is allowing third-party applications to continue offering their services . Improving and enhancing `` Closing the Gift Shop may disappoint many of the people who have given millions of gifts , but we made the decision after careful thought about where we need to focus our product development efforts , '' explains Facebook in a blog . `` We 'll be able to focus more on improving and enhancing products and features that people use every day , such as Photos , News Feed , Inbox , games , comments , the 'Like ' button and the Wall . '' Those who are worried that the gifts they have already accrued will disappear , do n't worry as Facebook has confirmed that they will be staying put on your wall . For those who are fed up of seeing virtual gift pop-ups appearing in their newsfeed , then Facebook 's cutting of this service may well be the biggest gift of all .

Facebook saw a dramatic drop in new active users in June . The social network was visited by just 320,800 active members from the United States , down from 7.8 million in May , according to figures released by Inside Facebook . Blame could be pointed at Facebook becoming saturated in the States , but the media backlash to its new privacy settings may well have caused the considerable decline in visits . Facebook blip ? Facebook 's largest demographic , the 18-44 age range , visited the site less during June , but users of other ages , which represent a smaller audience , remained as active as previous months . Inside Facebook points out that the 18 to 44 age group is probably most likely to have paid attention to the privacy concerns . However , this marked drop in active users could just be a blip : `` It 's not uncommon to see a saturated country like the US take a breather after a spurt of growth , '' Inside Facebook said . It added : `` Some unusually interesting demographic trends took place for the country in June that add to the overall growth number . ''

Lady ' I 'm going to wear a teapot on my head and not give a darn what you think ' Gaga has become the first person alive to reach 10 million fans on Facebook . A similar feat was achieved posthumously by Michael Jackson , but Gaga has done it and lived to tell the tale . According to Famecount , Gaga has beaten the likes of Barack Obama who is currently flagging under the 10 million mark . Gaga for Gaga The reason so many people are flocking to become followers with famous folk is apparently to do with the new-ish option that lets you become followers of fan pages of your favourite musicians and film stars . Interestingly , in second place – according to Famecount – is Vin Diesel who has n't exactly set the box office on fire recently . Currently , Lady Gaga is garnering around 140,000 new fans a day which is scary but also shows how much people power sites like Facebook have at the moment .
The BBC has shown off what its redesigned website will look like , complete with social networking tools . The site is set to get an overhaul – the biggest since 2003 – and to make things as open as possible , the BBC has shown off some of the extra functionality , including better use of images , easier ways to share stories and more multimedia like videos . `` We have focused on design and navigation , looking to see how we can make all the existing content we produce each day easier for you to find , use and share , '' says Steve Hermann , editor of BBC News , in a blog . Some of the more prominent changes include the sharing of stories , with the blog explaining : `` [ There are now ] links that allow users more quickly and simply to share stories with friends on social networks including Facebook and Twitter . '' Video has been overhauled and will now be on `` a bigger video player , streaming with better quality '' . There will also be a load more highlights to choose from on the updated site . The BBC 's websites are going through a number of changes at the moment . Back in May , the iPlayer 3 was updated to open beta and also featured a number of social-networking options .

Facebook has revealed to TechRadar that it will not be in the running for sponsoring the England football team , despite speculation that the site was in talks . The Telegraph had reported this week that Facebook was one of the forerunners to take over sponsorship of the team after Nationwide announced it was ending its sponsorship after 11 years . FA-cebook While it seemed highly unlikely that a company like Facebook would sponsor England , the story has been picked up by a number of sites , who note that BlackBerry , O2 and Orange are also in the running . TechRadar contacted Facebook and a spokesperson told us : `` Facebook is not in talks with the England Football team regarding sponsorship . '' This will be great news to Fabio Capello , who banned the England players from using social-networking sites while at the World Cup . Not that it actually made much of a difference to their performance .

Facebook has unveiled new features to the site , which are designed to make the tagging of photos easier . Speaking about the new face-recognition tech in a blog , Sam Odio from Facebook says about the updates : `` People love tagging their friends and family in photos , but we 've heard that it can be a tedious process . `` You now can add tags with just a couple of clicks directly from your home page and other sections of the site , using the same face detection technology that cameras have used for years . '' Essentially this means that you do n't have to manually add an image box to faces to tag them , as Facebook will now automatically 'see ' the faces . Those who are worries that they are automatically going to get tagged smoking and boozing at the work 's party , do n't be , it will recognise your face as an , er , face but you still have to manually add a name to the mug . Divvy it up Odio knows a lot about this sort of tech as until a few months ago he was part of Divvyshot – a photo-sharing service which was snapped up by Facebook . The company was bought to make Facebook 's photo service better , so the addition of better tagging should be the first in a long line of tweaks .

Facebook has rolled out new features for its app platform , which means that all third-party applications now have to ask for your permission before they take any of your information . If there is one issue that is Kryptonite to Facebook it 's privacy ; this move to bring transparency to the site 's applications is something Facebook will hopefully quash some of the privacy fears users may have . Share and share alike In a release , Facebook had this to say about the new privacy controls : `` We understand that it 's important that you also have control over what you 're sharing . `` With this new authorisation process , when you log into an application with your Facebook account , the application will only be able to access the public parts of your profile by default . `` These improvements reflect two core Facebook beliefs : first , your data belongs to you ; second , it should be easy to control what you share . `` If at any point you ask a developer to remove the data you 've granted them access to , we require that that they delete this information .

News Corporation-owned MySpace is now offering its users the option to sync with rival social network Facebook and micro-blogging site Twitter . Members can now post their status updates and shared content to Facebook and Twitter , in a move that is pretty much a tacit admission of the old maxim : `` if you ca n't beat 'em , join em . '' Span the networks The move takes the recently revamped 'stream ' design of MySpace profiles and plugs in Twitter and Facebook 's application program interfaces ( APIs ) to allow easy syncing across the networks . The syncing applies both to individual MySpace users , as well as bands and celebrities . `` This is particularly exciting for the millions of musicians on MySpace who can now use this tool as a complement to their MySpace Music presence and share their vast library of content , including full album catalogs , to people who 've liked their Facebook page , '' explained MySpace in a press release . Sync with Facebook Jennifer Ruffner , Director of Product , MySpace Stream explains a little further about the thinking behind Sync with Facebook . `` Sync with Facebook allows users to keep their friends on Facebook up to date on everything , including : sharing songs , latest photos , fun game apps , and more . `` The opportunities to experience and share this type of entertainment content are endless . This is particularly exciting for artists who can now use this tool as a complement to their MySpace Music presence and share their vast library of content , including full album catalogs , to people who 've liked their Facebook Page . '' `` Users continue to have the option to sync to Twitter as well . Once you 've synced your Facebook account , simply update your status on MySpace as you normally would ( from your homepage , status and mood page , or mobile phone ) . When you update your status on MySpace , it will then be shared with friends on Facebook . ''

The developer for the Facebook application on the iPhone has criticised Android and given reasons why the official app is poorer for Google phones . Although recently getting a decent upgrade , the Facebook for Android application has always been the poorer cousin to the iPhone version , and Joe Hewitt , who helped created the Apple option , says it 's down to the tools offered . `` The more I work with Android the more it reminds me of Windows… as in , it 's really flexible , agnostic , and developer-friendly , but also really sloppily designed , '' he said on Twitter . Like running through a meadow in linen trousers However , despite the problems , he did give praise to the open-thinking way that Google offered up the Android platform , calling Apple overbearing and hinting that that presence may cause more developers to switch platforms : `` Android tools are horrendous , OS is hideous , but the absence of big brother telling me what to do gives it a slight edge . '' While the criticism of Android is probably just , it 's important to remember the platform is less that two years old , and is developing at an incredible rate , something which Hewitt agrees with : `` Android fragmentation will hopefully stabilize within two years , and if not , at least people upgrade phones much more often than computers . '' Let 's just hope Google gets its act together to help create an app development platform to really start getting some quality options into the App Market .
The new version of Digg launches for all users this week , with the link-sharing social network taking some cues from Facebook and Twitter . Founder and CEO Kevin Rose explained how the new changes will impact users over on the Digg blog Follows Facebook and Twitter The new-look Digg has been in invitation-only alpha testing for over a year now , and focuses on a Facebook and Twitter style system of following other users . `` Hey everyone , I 'm excited to announce that today we opened up the newest version of our Digg platform . We 've been working hard on this next evolution of Digg ( what we 've been calling `` v4 '' ) and everyone here is really looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes we 've made , '' writes Rose . `` This redesign is a major revision of our platform – front end to back end – this is just phase one of what will be an on-going , iterative process , involving lots of input from all of you . We 'll be pushing out features on a regular basis and tweaking often . `` Our goal has always been for Digg to be a place where people can discover and share content and conversations from anywhere on the web . With Digg v4 , we are introducing a few things that will make discovering and discussing news a lot better . '' `` My News '' Digg users also get a new view called `` My News '' clearly displaying links from those you follow , offering a more streamlined version of what it popular and of direct interest to you at any given time . However , `` Top News '' view is still set to be the default view , with `` My News '' as an option for those that prefer it . The latest redesign is the first since Digg founder Kevin Rose took over from Jay Adelson as CEO . Digg 's traffic has slumped over the past twelve months , particularly when compared to the exponential growth of Twitter and Facebook You can see a detailed walkthrough video of the new Digg with Kevin Rose on Vimeo .

Facebook has been valued at $ 33.7 billion ( £22 billion ) , making it a bigger money maker than publicly listed technology brands like eBay . Although Facebook is a privately held company , the Financial Times has taken a look at secondary market transactions – ie , how much initial investors are selling their private stakes for – in the company to see how much the social network is actually worth . The number is bigger than that of established brands like eBay , which has been priced at around $ 30.1 billion . And it is also double that of Yahoo , which is said to be worth $ 18.3 billion . Money talks Although $ 34 billion is a phenomenal amount of money for a social network – bearing in mind MySpace was bought for $ 580 million back in 2005 – its price is still dwarfed by the likes of Google and Microsoft . Google is currently worth around $ 143.9 billion , Microsoft $ 197 billion and Apple a whopping £200 billion . However , when Google initially went public in 2004 it floated for $ 1.67 billion . This was one of the biggest Initial Public Offering for a technology company , a figure which Facebook would far succeed if it went public . According to the Financial Times , though , the social network is unlikely to make the jump until 2012 , which will be a hugely significant year for Facebook – unless the Mayans have something to do with it .

Foursquare CEO Dennis Crowley has responded to the news that Facebook is taking on location tagging with Facebook Places , insisting that a redesign and new features will keep people checking in . Facebook Places offers many of the kind of features that has made Foursquare a hit , but Business Insider received an email from Crowley insisting that Facebook users were already well served . `` We 're still a platform for location , specifically around sharing locations though check-ins , surfacing interesting things around you and using game mechanics to encourage and reward for certain actions and/or behaviours , '' wrote Crowley . Location , location , location `` Facebook also launched a location platform , which appears to be mostly based on checkins ( and common FB elements like comments / likes / photos ) , '' he added . `` We already allow users to publish their 4SQ checkins into the Facebook News Feed and we 'll eventually going to allow users to push them into the Facebook Checkin Feed . `` I 'd imagine we 'll probably pull FB checkins into 4SQ too . We 're in the middle of a redesign and some new feature launches , so we 're going to get through those before getting started on FB integration . '' Crowley also makes the valid point that Facebook photos are bigger than Flickr , but it does not make the latter any less of a successful service . Whether there 's room for two geo location tagging services remains to be seen . Via Business Insider

Update : Facebook Places has now launched in the UK - check out our hands-on review . Facebook has announced Facebook Places – an app that enables you to post location-specific information to Facebook . Sadly , it 's only available in the US for the moment , though we 're sure it wo n't be too long until it rolls out to the UK – and the Facebook iPhone app has already been updated on the UK App Store . So does this mean the end of Foursquare ? Perhaps , Facebook is even using Foursquare 's check in terminology to describe the action of , er , checking in . The social networking site has issued a full 3.2 update to its iPhone app , while touch.facebook.com also supports Facebook Places on other handsets – providing your browser is HTML5 compatible . A button in the mobile apps ( see image above ) enables you to check in , and the workings are extremely similar to Foursquare , as you 'll be presented with a list of nearby places to select from ( or add your own ) . In the UK , the iPhone app has the Places button in place , but tap it and you 're told it is n't yet available here . `` You have the option to share your location by checking in to that place and letting friends know where you are . You can easily see if any of your friends have also chosen to check in nearby , '' says Michael Sharon , Facebook product manager for Places , in a blog post . After checking in , your check-in will create a story in your friends ' News Feeds , and show up in the Recent Activity section on the page for that place . `` Like tagging you in a photo '' `` When you check in , you can also tag friends who are with you , just as you can tag a friend in a status update or photo , '' continues Sharon . `` You can post an update along with your check-in to tell people more about what you are doing . In the 'People Here Now ' section , you can see others who are checked in with you at that place . '' You 're also able to see who has been to a location before . Only your friends will be able to see when you visit or are tagged at a place , unless you have specifically set your master privacy control to Everyone . You also have the choice to set more restrictive customised settings . When a friend tags you through Places , you will receive a notification on Facebook and on your mobile device . `` The first time this happens , you 'll be given the choice to allow your friends to check you in to places . When your friends check you in , it is as if you have checked in at that place yourself . You can always remove any Places check-in or tag using your mobile device or on the web . It 's like removing yourself from a photo tag . '' You can also choose for friends to not be able to check you in .

The number of reported 'abuses ' on Facebook is up 650 per cent thanks to the ClickCEOP application introduced on the site . According to the Press Association , the amount of people who have used the app to report problems on the site has risen to 211 – which is up from just 28 people the month before the application was introduced . The ClickCEOP app ( created by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre ) has been downloaded a total of 55,000 times since its launch and while it is n't quite the 'panic button ' campaigners wanted installed on to Facebook 's main page , it is a compromise that does seem to be working . Making the internet safer Speaking about the CEOP app , Joanna Shields , Facebook 's vice president for Europe , said : `` There is no single answer to making the internet safer but CEOP has taken a great step forward by setting up their ClickCEOP page . `` It now means that they can have an ongoing dialogue with thousands of Facebook users , educating them about how to stay safe online in a place and language they are familiar with .

Facebook has hit out at Google over its net neutrality pact with Verizon in the US , saying it supports an `` open internet '' . In a controversial move , Google and Verizon announced this week it was proposing new rules as to how web traffic – both through wired broadband and wireless – could be managed in the future . Facebook has reacted to this , believing that no matter how big or small a company is , it should n't be given any web preference . Vibrant and competitive In a statement the social network said : `` Facebook continues to support principles of net neutrality for both landline and wireless networks . `` Preserving an open internet that is accessible to innovators – regardless of their size or wealth – will promote a vibrant and competitive marketplace where consumers have ultimate control over the content and services delivered through their internet connections . '' It 's no wonder Facebook is opposing the pact – anything that favours Google over the site would cause serious problems , especially if Google does decide to create its own social network .

Five is all set to launch its catch-up TV service on Facebook , becoming the first broadcaster to offer TV shows on the site . New Media Age is reporting that a deal has been struck which will see embedded videos on Facebook `` within the next week to ten days '' , so users can update their status then tune into an episode of Neighbours . This is a massive move for Facebook , pushing the site into an untested realm for the social network – video streaming . TV catch-up The likes of YouTube and Hulu will no doubt be watching closely to see if any other broadcasters sign on to embed their content on to Facebook . It is unlikely that the likes of ITV will sign on , though . The channel has reportedly been the main sticking point for Hulu not launching in the UK and its new boss , Adam Crozier , said recently that it was looking to refresh its own catch up service rather than port content on to other sites . While Five will be the first broadcaster to offer content straight from Facebook , the BBC in its iPlayer revamp has added social-networking tools to the service , making episodes easier to share .
Facebook 's `` check-in '' Foursquare competitor is imminent and due within weeks , according to latest reports . Multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNET that the new geo-location feature in Facebook is due to launch very soon . The check-in on Facebook feature with take the form of an application programming interface ( API ) for third-party developers to make best use of location-aware apps . `` We are working on location features and product integrations , which we 'll be launching in the coming months , and we 'll share more details when appropriate , '' Facebook spokesman Larry Yu told CNET . Like this place ? One developer of geolocation apps was told by a Facebook insider that it might be wise to change a thumbs-up style feature in his application to `` like , '' which gives some indication of where Facebook may go with geo-location . Facebook has reportedly partnered with Localeze , the local search provider that provides Twitter 's `` Places '' directory . `` We can not comment on any future deals , however can say that we anticipate having a few significant social announcements in the coming weeks/month , '' added a Localeze rep .

Facebook is set to tweak how many notifications a person receives , bringing in an 'unsubscribe ' button and cleaning up the birthday section of the site . The unsubscribe feature is said to be testing at the moment , with the folks at Inside Facebook managing to grab a sneaky peak of the button in action . Essentially , implementing this feature will mean that if you Like somebody 's post and then unsubscribe you wo n't be sent notifications every time someone else says something on that particular post . Five years ago the above sentence would have made no sense whatsoever . It 's your birthday Facebook is also in the process of testing a new birthday wall which formats the look so it does n't pollute the rest of your feed . So , when it 's your birthday , Facebook is looking to aggregate all the birthday related tweets in one easy to read post . That is unless you do n't put the words Happy Birthday into your message , as the algorithm will probably ignore whatever birthday missive you write . These are part of a multitude of changes to the site , including the hiring of a new boss for its games division . Via Inside Facebook
Facebook is hiring a dedicated games boss , to deal with games publishers and development studios , indicating the increasing importance of gaming to the social networking giant .

New statistics for Facebook show that its UK growth has slowed somewhat , compared to the massive drive in traffic the site has seen in the last five years . While there wo n't exactly be panic in the social network 's offices , the latest stats from Hitwise do show a levelling out with both page views and session time on the site . The new figures show that the average session time on the site has levelled out to around 27.36 minutes in June/July , down from a seasonal peak of 30 minutes in December . When it comes to page views , these are at 16.73 per cent ( of total UK market share ) , which is a slight dip from what was seen in April . Number crunching In real terms , this levelling out still accounts for phenomenal traffic for the social network . At 16.73 per cent the site gets more than double the page views in the UK than its nearest rival ( Google with 8.22 per cent ) , which means that one in six page views from the UK is Facebook . Google is still winning the numbers war when it comes to visits , with Facebook accounting for 7.14 per cent to Google 's 9.59 per cent . Hitwise , though , is questioning whether saturation point for the site could well be on the horizon , explaining : `` Cleary Facebook is not losing traffic in the UK , but do these stats point to a stabilisation ? `` The rapid period of the site 's growth is now probably over in the UK , but does that mean Facebook has reached saturation point ? '' With 26 million people in the UK already signed up to the site , Hitwise may well have a point that they could be running out of users . Recent government statistics puts the amount of adults online as 37.4 million , so the site still has a few more people to entice in with the thrills of Farmville .

Facebook has done a bit of cyber-squatter cleaning and grabbed the rights to Facebook.me , which was originally registered in the United Arab Emirates in 2008 . While this looks like a clear cut case of trimming off someone who was trying to capitalise on the Facebook name , there are some reports that Facebook Me is set to become another launch for the social-networking giant . New service ? Currently facebook.me ( which uses the domain for Montenegro ) is redirecting to Facebook but Mashable is reporting that Facebook Me is also the name of an app which turns your profile page into something that resembles Tumblr , the quick-sharing blog site . The app takes your profile information and customises it into a number of different formats , bringing an extra layer of personalisation to the site . There 's no word from Facebook if Facebook Me will become an official spin-off of the site , but it will be interesting to see what happens to the domain in the future .
Facebook for Android has finally been overhauled for the legions of Google-phone users . The new update brings a raft of changes , and offer some much-needed functionality to make the Android offering as compelling as the iPhone version . The main updates are easily visible – a draggable notifications bar at the bottom of the screen will show you all new updates , and a photo-reel at the bottom of the screen gives you access to new snaps uploaded by your friends . Updated access You can also access events and respond to them within the application as well as commenting on photos without jumping to the mobile version of the site . Sadly , Facebook has n't got that element totally right on the new Android version of the application – you still get chucked out to the mobile site to read new notifications ( although previews are shown in the notifications drawer ) . But overall it 's a lot better than before , and apart from that little notifications bump , you can stay within the application to do nearly everything – take a photo , upload it , port contacts to your phone etc . It 's available now from the Android Market , so head on over and download or update to start actually using Facebook on your HTC Desire or Samsung Galaxy S ( or pretty much any Android phone really ... )
YouTube is celebrating after 10 million people Facebook Liked the online video giant , with the Google owned service thanking fans for making it more popular than Ronaldo and even 'music ' . Facebook Like has been a major hit with fans of the social network , which recently hit the 500 million users mark . One in every 50 Facebook subscribers have apparently taken time out to acknowledge their like for YouTube , to the delight of Community Manager Mia Quagliarelly . `` Today our Facebook page hit an important milestone : over 10 million of you have clicked that `` Like '' button , making us more popular thanCristiano Ronaldo and -- whoa -- music ? ! '' blogged Quagliarelly .

Facebook and leading internet telephony provider Skype are said to be looking at a major partnership , according to emerging reports . Reuters claims that Mark Zuckerberg 's social-networking website Facebook is in talks with the VoIP-provider , looking at ways of integrating their services . Skype up Facebook friends The news emerged initially from the Wall Street Journal , citing unnamed sources claiming to be familiar with the matter . The deal would let Facebook users sign into Skype via their Facebook Connect accounts , according to the Journal 's source . Users would also be able to chat with all of their Facebook friends from within Skype . Skype 's latest 5.0 version is expected to feature the improved Facebook functionality , and is due to be released within weeks .

Customers of mobile network Three can now access Facebook for free , thanks to a new deal with the social-networking site . Users can now access 0.facebook.com , which is a stripped down version of the website that features no graphics , only a list of status updates and the like . Three is the first network to offer the service in the UK , explaining in a press release : `` At Three , we want to make the mobile internet easy and affordable for everyone . `` We are delighted to work with Facebook to bring one of the most visited mobile websites to our customers for free . `` We have the only 100 % 3G network in the UK so that we can provide our customers with the very best experience of the mobile internet '' Facebook for free There have been a number of rumours that a Facebook phone is imminent from INQ , a manufacturer which already makes a Skype-branded phone ( the Skypephone S2 ) and an unofficial Facebook handset ( the INQ1 ) , which featured layering dedicated to the social network . Three was the mobile operator for both these handsets , so it makes sense that it would be the first in the UK to effectively offer Facebook for free to its users . While this phone is yet to surface , the free Facebook deal by Three ( try saying that 10 times fast ) seems like a decent stop gap for those who want to browse the site , but do n't want to pay for it . `` We are always looking to work with innovative companies to provide simple and fast mobile access to Facebook across the world , '' said Henri Moissinac , head of mobile business , Facebook . `` Thanks to our collaboration with Three , people will be able to stay connected to their friends on Facebook while they are on the go – all completely free . ''
If you believe the rumours , Facebook is working with INQ mobile and AT & T on an iPhone-style phone , and a network to go with it . It makes perfect sense - a Facebook phone has the potential to dissolve geographical boundaries and equip you with a globally-transparent currency that 'll let you do things that you ca n't do in your local currency . A phone and currency ? Let 's take it from the currency . Facebook has one thing that everyone wants - users . So many , in fact , that it ranks the fourth largest country in the world . And every country needs currency , even a virtual one . Facebook calls its virtual moolah `` Credits '' . It debuted last year , and is now the only method of payment for the games created by Facebook 's number one third-party developer , Zynga How do you acquire these virtual Credits ? Facebook sells them in gift stores in the US . Expect them to be available in a UK store near you soon . So at the end of a virtual currency is a physical bank account with real cash . Inside Networks , which tracks Facebook apps , says the virtual currency is expected to generate $ 835 million in hard cash this year . From here on , it 's only going to grow . Facebook projects that its virtual currency will be used to purchase much of what is sold on the site , and Facebook gets 30 percent of every sale . The advantage of a virtual currency is that it 's impervious to physical borders , and streamlines International transactions . If an item costs 5 credits in the US , it costs 5 credits here in the UK . Happening now Now take this virtual currency a step further , and you have access to a broad range of items which you could pay for with virtual Credits . And you 'll do it using your Facebook phone . Far fetched ? No , it 's already happening . There 's the yet-to-be-launched Social TopUps service which allows Facebook users to directly recharge a mobile phone user 's prepaid mobile phone in another country . Of course something like SocialTopsUps requires the participation of network operators across the globe . To tie up with the operators , Facebook needs its own phone . The rumoured phones are said to be modeled on the iPhone , but the similarities will extend far beyond aesthetics . Much like the iPhone , Facebook would want to meld its platform with the phone 's hardware . If it 's your own money involved , who would you trust as a user - a third-party app using the Facebook API or an official , tightly integrated Facebook phone and app ? The possibilities of a cross-border virtual global currency and the convenience of a phone , are limitless . SocialTopsUps and a Facebook-badged phone will whet your appetite . Soon you 'll be able to use your Facebook phone and virtual credits to pay for items in the real world .

Microsoft has announced it has added a number of new features to Hotmail , including the ability to chat with your Facebook friends through the email service . Microsoft 's Dick Craddock explains the new features in a blog post , noting : `` We recently announced that Messenger would let you chat with your Facebook friends . `` We released this into the beta of our Messenger app for your PC a few weeks ago , and last week we added this into Messenger on your iPhone . `` We 're now adding this ability to chat with Facebook friends into Hotmail , making it easier for the 250 million Hotmail users that also use Facebook to stay in touch with those friends . '' Better pictures This is n't the only new addition to Hotmail , as Microsoft has also unveiled a new package tracking system for the service which recognise the number and display the real time shipping status when you get an email from a courier . Currently , this is for the US postal service , but we 're hoping it will come to the UK at some point . Microsoft is also allowing the sending of bulk photos through emails by integrating its SkyDrive service into Hotmail . Essentially this means you can have up to 10GB of photos sent through in an email . Finally , it will now let you preview videos that are sent via email . Although you can already do this with YouTube and Hulu clips , this has been extended to stuff from Daily Motion and Justin.tv . The rollout will happen over the next few weeks , with Craddock noting : `` We believe that these features will benefit people using Hotmail with a more efficient email experience that saves time and is just more fun to use .

Facebook has outlined its plans to improve the quality and experience of gaming on the social network at a dedicated gaming event in Palo Alto this week . The event was led by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , with numerous game developers in attendance . Zuckerberg outlined how , every day , around 300 million people come to Facebook.com and that while hundreds of millions of users love playing games on Facebook , there are equally hundreds of millions of users that HATE playing games , and ( more likely ) hate spam from friends who are playing games on Facebook . Site Integrity team Facebook has a team called the Site Integrity/Graph Integrity team , who are tasked with ensuring that the experience users have on the site is a positive one . Zuckerberg claims that 'friend spam ' – friend requests that are n't accepted – is down 40 per cent over the last two month , largely down to improving gaming on the network and eliminating those negative experiences some users were having connected to Facebook games . `` When we turn the weight of game stories in News Feed up— we get complaints , '' said the Facebook CEO . `` Turn it down , get complaints . We want to build and enable anything that hundreds of millions of people want to use . `` The solutions are pretty simple : if someone is playing a game , and they want context about that game… then do n't limit stories about that game . On the other hand , if you 've never played a certain game , then you probably do n't want to see context from a lot of friends who are playing that game . '' New Facebook games team Facebook now has a dedicated gaming team , headed up by Jared Morgenstern , who outlines how the top ten games on the network all have over 12 million active users each Morgenstern notes on the Facebook blog this week how the company has `` assembled a team of dedicated engineers and product managers who are focused exclusively on designing the platform you need to maximize the potential of your games . '' He adds : `` And we are game lovers , every last one of us . It is clear that games have been one of the most successful categories of Platform applications , but we 've struggled in the past with how to optimize the games experience on Facebook . '' As such Facebook has announced a series of changes which are `` designed to lay the foundation for further games innovation on Facebook… the first step toward a new platform infrastructure and APIs that will provide you with the tools to reach and engage the growing number of people who play games , and drive discovery among their friends . `` With these changes , we 're also simplifying our platform policies dramatically . We realise that detailed policies that spell out exactly what you can do and ca n't do are hard for developers and simply add friction to the process of building on Facebook . `` With the changes we are making today , we are in a better position to eliminate many specific policies in favor of broader principles to ensure that applications respect user trust .

Facebook 's head of privacy , Lord Richard Allan , has revealed that hacking of users ' Facebook accounts to scam them out of cash has become a 'major issue ' for the social networking giant . Allan reveals that Facebook is developing new ways of countering the threat of hacked accounts and stolen identities . Lord Allan has detailed how Facebook is implementing new ways of detecting when a user 's account has been compromised and is adding more warnings to users to let them know if and when their accounts are logged-into from different places or in different ways to how they are normally accessed . Site integrity Allan said of the problem : `` The latest thing you 'll see that is a major issue is people hacking into accounts . Now , if you 're logging in from an unusual location you 'll get extra security questions and if you want to login by a new device [ Facebook ] notifies you by SMS or email . '' Facebook 's `` site integrity '' project looks at new and better ways of tracking suspicious activity on the network , to ensure that user 's accounts are secure . Ronald K Noble , secretary general of Interpol , recently revealed how his Facebook identity was being targeted by cybercriminals . Noble explained : `` Just recently Interpol 's information security incident response team discovered two Facebook profiles attempting to assume my identity as Interpol 's secretary general . One of the impersonators was using this profile to obtain information on fugitives targeted during our recent Operation Infra Red . '' Facebook is now using `` name verification '' as one way of ensuring hackers can not access accounts , by simply asking the user to identify a friend from their network from that friend 's Facebook photo . `` It is unfortunate that some people use the internet to maliciously target people either via scams or by compromising accounts on Facebook , over email or on fake websites , '' a Facebook spokeswoman said . `` However , unlike other websites , or email , or even the phone , we provide our users with robust reporting tools to report any content they are unsure of and anything which violates our terms , will be removed quickly . '' Facebook recently launched Facebook Places in the UK and has over 500 million users worldwide .

Facebook has denied rumours that it is planning on developing mobile phone hardware in the future , although has confirmed that it is pushing deeper into the mobile space . The initial rumour of a 'Facebook phone ' came from TechCrunch , with the website claiming that it has sources close to a Facebook project that claim the company is working with an unnamed third party to build mobile hardware . Facebook already has a number of smartphone apps , with plans to develop those already available and release more in the near future . Jaime Schopflin , a spokesman for Facebook , said in no uncertain terms that the company `` is not building a phone . '' Deeper integration with mobile Schopflin added that Facebook 's current projects included `` deeper integrations with some [ mobile ] manufacturers , '' adding : `` Our view is that almost all experiences would be better if they were social , so integrating deeply into existing platforms and operating systems is a good way to enable this . `` The bottom line is that whenever we work on a deep integration , people want to call it a 'Facebook Phone ' because that 's such an attractive soundbite , but building phones is just not what we do , '' Schopflin added .

Facebook has officially announced Facebook Places for the UK enabling you to post location-specific information to Facebook . The link is now live in the iPhone app and you can also access Places on other handsets through touch.facebook.com . Be warned that by using Places your location will automatically be posted to your wall for all to see - there is no pre-warning about this specifically though there is a more general warning . However , to be fair to Facebook , Places is opt in , so you only check in if you have authorised it . You do also get a warning if you define a new Place as you 'll see . So let 's get started . Your iPhone app will highlight that Places is now available - if it 's the latest version of the app of course . Click on the Places icon to see a list of your friends ' locations . The eagle-eyed among you will note that this image is taken a lot later than all the others . That 's because , when we first tried Places at 8.30 this morning , none of our friends were using it . This has now changed ! This is what you 'll see if you ca n't connect to the internet ( good work , Vodafone ) . However , if you have some semblance of connectivity , a list of local businesses will then appear . You can click the + icon to add a new one - we 'll show you this screen shortly . So we 've decided that we 're at a place called The Corridor ( a shopping arcade ) . As you can see , you can say what you 're doing there as well as tag other people in your status update . Using the options menu in the top right you can also flag inaccuracies in the location data . Clicking the Check in button will take you to this screen where you have to agree to use Facebook Places . THIS IS THE ONLY PRIVACY WARNING before sharing your location , so take heed . Facebook says that `` check-ins are defaulted to friends only ( unless your master setting is everyone ) and minors will not appear in posts or check-ins to anyone but friends , you can also always remove any check-in from your phone or on the web . '' `` Users have full privacy control and can customise these settings as well as amend them from a mobile device . '' If you chose to add a new place on the first Places menu screen , this is what you 'll see . Define the type of place it is , click Add , and you 'll see a warning about making places public as well . When you check in , your location is shown in your News Feed , and it will show up in the Recent Activity section on the page for that place . Facebook says that if you prefer not to appear in the 'People Here Now ' section on a place page after you check in , you can uncheck the appropriate box in your privacy settings . Facebook has obviously built some pretty robust privacy settings around this , but from our first look at Places it 's still confusing as to what you need to configure and what 's best to choose . The verdict is decidedly 'use with caution ' . As far as the actual service goes , we think Facebook 's first foray into location-aware has success written all over it . Why ? Because , providing you 're willing to share your data , the whole thing is so easy . Using Foursquare or Google Latitude ? You wo n't be for long .
Facebook has announced this week that its location-based service Places has come to the UK . Places first arrived back in August in the US and the more eagle-eyed of you will have spotted that there has been a dormant link to it on the UK Facebook iPhone app since then . Its arrival in the US sparked something of an outcry from privacy supporters who felt letting others know where you are at any given moment could turn you into bait for stalkers . But that was last month , which means we have had a bit more time to digest just what Facebook Places means to everyday users of Facebook and not just fan the flames of the privacy debate . So , here are some of the facts about Facebook Places and just why it 's going to be a social-network game-changer : It brings social networking into the real world It 's all very well speaking to your mates online or liking their status updates , but it is n't as good as meeting up face to face over a drink or two . Facebook Places allows you to do that , keeping track of where your friends are . It 's a recommendation engine If you spot that someone goes regularly to a certain café , then it 's probably because they really like the place – or they fancy the waitress . Places opens up where you live and may offer different places and things to see and do . This is similar to what Foursquare has done , but changed going to places into a game of one-upmanship . It turns your phone into the main place for Facebook Twitter 's explosive growth is n't just to do with the amount of celebrities using the thing but because it is so easily accessible from a mobile phone . Facebook has gone some way to improving its phone apps , but the service is still primarily looked at on a computer . Places gives the mobile phone version of Facebook a massive USP – it means that there is now a reason to use the social network on your phone as well as your desktop . Makes bumping into people that little bit easier It 's fair to say that most of us do n't actually meet up with the majority of our friends on Facebook . Some may want to keep it that way , but Places is focusing on the ones who would n't mind meeting up with real people once every so often . So , if you sign up you will be notified if a person is in a similar area to you . This could also act as a warning if you definitely do n't want to meet up with a particular person . It changes friends into tour guides If you are going to a place you have never been before and someone on your network has been there , Places allows them to offer travel advice , recommendations and the like .
Facebook has officially announced Facebook Places for the UK – an application that allows you to post location-specific information to Facebook . Places has been available on the UK Facebook app for a while - since it was launched in the US in August - but the link was dormant.It has now been activated . A link in the app allows you to check in wherever you are , making this a similar app to Foursquare . Once you check in you can see others on your network who have also checked in . At a Facebook event in London , with TechRadar in attendance , Michael Sharon , Facebook product manager for Places , said : `` Facebook is about real-world interaction , a place to share information about yourself with people you already know . Evolution `` Places evolved over time , when we saw how many people were using their status updates to tell friend where they are and what they are doing . `` It makes it easier to be more social , make it really easy to share where you are , discover new places , places you never knew about . '' When you do check in , this will be shown in your friends ' News Feeds , and show up in the Recent Activity section on the page for that place .

Soon-to-be-launched social network site Diaspora has announced it is releasing its source code to developers . The makers of Diaspora – four New York university students – are pitching the site as a `` community project '' which `` puts users in control '' . The idea for the site was borne from the privacy problems Facebook recently had , proving that there could be room for a social-network which does n't use people 's data for monetary gain . `` We began the summer a list of technologies , and a few bold claims and the goal to make an intrinsically more private social network , '' explains Diaspora on its blog . `` The overwhelming response that we elicited made us realise that technology would n't be enough . '' Share and share alike This is why Diaspora is being handed over to devs , so that the crowd can make a `` simple and functional tool for contextual sharing '' . Screenshots for Diaspora have been released and the site looks like a cleaner version of Facebook . Features that are being implemented in the site include the ability to share photos with friends privately and in real time and the fact that all data is signed and encrypted . Interestingly in the alpha release for Diaspora which is set for October , Facebook integration will be included .

According to data from comScore , US users spent more time on Facebook than they did on Google for the first time ever in August . While Facebook had comfortably sat below Google for the last three years , it has surged recently , creeping ahead of the search giant around the time it hit 500 million users , so maybe we should n't be surprised . For the last few years , Yahoo sites had ruled the roost when it came eating up the American people 's time , but the chart shows that it has failed to grow for the last few years , allowing Facebook and Google to steal a march on it . Bouncing back Perhaps the tie-up with Microsoft will help it claw back those precious minutes as people realise the sheer joy in trolling through photos of people they do n't really know . The timing of this particular graph is a little unfortunate , coming the day after the unveiling of Google Instant , which will trim yet more precious tenths of second off the time users spend there . Of course , as long as people keep clicking ads , we doubt Google minds too much how long you spend hanging around . Via Business Insider

Apple and Facebook are not seeing eye-to-eye over the former 's entry into social networking this week , with the announcement of Apple Ping . Ping is available now , as part of the new Apple iTunes 10 , although Facebook does n't seem to want to get officially involved . Apple CEO Steve Jobs informed reporters this week that the two companies had discussed how to work together to promote Ping , but that Facebook 's terms were `` onerous . '' Ping causes 'issues ' Apple used some of Facebook 's open programming interfaces to let users find their Facebook friends on Ping , although this stopped working earlier this week . While Ping could well have directed considerable amounts of traffic to Facebook , sources claim that this would have caused site stability and infrastructure problems , hence Facebook pulling the Ping plug . Following this , Facebook said in statement : `` We 're working with Apple to resolve this issue . We 've worked together successfully in the past , and we look forward to doing so in the future . '' Apple has not yet responded to the matter . Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has already opened his own account on Ping . Via The New York Times

The latest data from mobile network 3 clearly shows that social networking website Facebook and casual gaming firm Zynga ( they of FarmVille fame ) dominate mobile broadband use in the UK . 3 has released the first of a number of planned research papers detailing mobile broadband traffic use and behaviour . Facebook and gaming dominate Unsurprisingly , social networking and casual gaming are right up there at the top of the chart . 3 has over one million mobile broadband and 3G dongle customers in the UK , who used a total of 2,500 terabytes of data throughout the month of July 2010 . 3 now claims that its users make up 40 per cent of the dongle market in the UK . Facebook use amongst those customers made up 7.023 terabytes of that data use . Following Facebook and Zynga in the top ten most-visited services on 3 's network are those sites and tech brands that you would expect to see , including Apple , Google , Microsoft , MSN , YouTube and Bebo Here are the ten ten sites used by 3 's mobile broadband users throughout July 2010 In decreasing order : Facebook 7023 gigabytes of data Zynga 3584 Apple 2491 Google 1717 Farmville 1680 MSN 947 Hotmail 708 YouTube 678 Microsoft 657 Bebo 304
Okay , firstly , an admission . We all want Wagner to win the X Factor . 54-year-old Wagner Carrilho , for those that deny themselves the guilty pleasure of watching X Factor of a Saturday night , is a funny old Brazilian man who used to be a PE teacher and is now bravely branching out into the world of big-budget , blanket-promoted reality TV in the UK . And there 's a picture of him holding a lion by the tail . The comedy choice for X Factor He is clearly the comedy choice for the 2010 competition . This year 's Jedward , but somehow a little bit less annoying ( not that you could top them on that factor ) and a lot more vulnerable . By the show 's own logic , Wagner has not got a cat 's chance of getting anywhere near the X Factor final . Which is why there is a new Facebook campaign to help to give Wagner the push he needs to win the show . Whether or not the campaign will gain any traction , in the same way that last year 's Facebook campaign put Rage Against The Machine straight to the top of the charts ahead of X Factor 2009 winner Joe McElderry is still to be seen . The campaign is being run by a group of people who are clearly not massive fans of Simon Cowell . One commentator , Thanxx , wrote on the site : `` If you just fancy a really crazy Xmas number 1 this year ... vote Wagner ! ! ! If you despise all what the X Factor stands for vote Wagner ! `` If you hate Simon Cowell and want to p * * * him off vote Wagner ! If you want to help run the X factor into the ground and cause mayhem vote Wagner ! '' Another commentator , Simon Matthews added : `` I actually think Wagner would make for a really fun Xmas number 1 , got ta be better than the alternative romantic slushy s * * * e that one of the other contestants would bring out ! '' Despite the Facebook haters , Wagner is still the bookies favourite to be booted out of the show this week .

Facebook has announced another round of tweaks to Facebook Photos , offering drag and drop functionality to the service . According to Facebook the ability to drag and drop picture folders on the screen has been the number one wish from its users , so like the veritable genie in a bottle , Facebook has made this wish come true . You can also drag photos around in an album so you can put all the decent photos at the front . Hi-res photos Another new feature is high-res uploading . This was something which was first announced earlier in the month and means you can add high-res images to Facebook and print out a photo-quality version of these images from the photo album . There is also a better photo browser , which makes it easier to flick through images . There 's no news on when these features will rollout , but there is a video of how the new improvements work .

Facebook has quickly responded to stories that some third-party applications are sharing user data , accusing the press of exaggerating the implications of what was put public . It has come to light that certain applications are sharing the User ID ( UUID ) of their subscribers – something which is against the Facebook developers ' policy . However , the UID is not an especially critical piece of information , and Facebook believes that some sections of the media is making a mountain out of a molehill . Protecting user data `` Our policy is very clear about protecting user data , ensuring that no one can access private user information without explicit user consent , blogged Facebook 's Mike Vernal . `` Recently , it has come to our attention that several applications built on Facebook Platform were passing the User ID ( UID ) , an identifier that we use within our APIs , in a manner that violated this policy . `` In most cases , developers did not intend to pass this information , but did so because of the technical details of how browsers work . `` Press reports have exaggerated the implications of sharing a UID . Knowledge of a UID does not enable anyone to access private user information without explicit user consent . `` Nevertheless , we are committed to ensuring that even the inadvertent passing of UIDs is prevented and all applications are in compliance with our policy . '' Public scrutiny Facebook is well aware that its privacy policy is now under massive scrutiny and that any breach or loophole will come to the media 's attention . The company 's past transgressions mean that it may well never get the level of trust it desires , although the public 's capacity for uploading every nook and cranny of their lives has never been bigger . `` Ensuring that Facebook users are in control of their information is essential for the success of your application and the rest of Facebook Platform , '' concludes Facebook 's statement .

Skype for Windows 5.0 has been announced , with integrated Facebook news feed and phonebook and an overhauled user interface . The popular online communications platform is keen to keep growing and is hoping that the integration of social networking from Facebook will enhance its offering . The new Skype for Windows also brings a 'revitalised ' look for its familiar video and audio calls and instant messaging and – crucially - the much vaunted group video calling ( in open beta ) . Even more social `` The Facebook integration makes Skype even more social , '' explains Skype . `` For the first time Skype users can keep up-to-date and interact with their Facebook News Feed , including posting status updates , commenting , and liking , directly from Skype . `` Even better , the Facebook Phonebook in Skype allows users to call and SMS their Facebook friends directly on their mobile phones and landlines with just a few clicks . `` If your Facebook friend is also a Skype contact , you can make a free Skype-to-Skype call . '' According to Skype – 40 per cent of all Skype to Skype minutes in the first half of 2010 were video calls – and the arrival of group calls could well increase that . You can download Skype for Windows 5.0 from http : //www.skype.com .
Microsoft and Facebook have announced a major new partnership , in which Facebook 's social data is being added to Microsoft Bing to improve the search engine 's search results . Bing now displays relevant information on what has been 'Liked ' by your Facebook friends in an optional module displayed in its search results . Bing also offers Facebook-powered people search results . These new features will only work if you are logged into your Facebook account while searching using Microsoft Bing . They are being introduced immediately , with the full service being rolled out over the coming months . Personalised search results The key idea behind the new partnership is to offer a truly 'personalised ' search function via Bing , relevant to your friends and families likes on Facebook . Microsoft claims that around four per cent of all queries are people searches , which equates to around a billion queries per month . Microsoft is introducing a Facebook popup , which will appear if you are logged into Facebook or have an active Facebook cookie – giving the user the options : Learn More or No Thanks . This will pop-up the first five times you visit Bing . If you choose to ignore the pop-up each time , then the new Facebook modules feature will be automatically turned on . If you then want to turn it off you will have to remove Bing from your Facebook account . You can see Microsoft 's demo video of The Bing Social Layer over at the Bing.com Community Blog

Facebook has announced that it has upped the security credentials of the site , offering a number of new features that make sure nobody else can get hold of your information . The three new features are : one-time passwords ( which has recently been added to Hotmail ) , remote signing out and information update prompts . Facebook in its blog says the features have been created to make the site more secure but Graham Cluley at security firm Sophos is unsure about the use of one-time passwords . You 've got the keylog ... He explained about the news : `` If you believe a computer might not be secure in the first place , why would you use it to access personal accounts such as Facebook ? `` A temporary password may stop keylogging spyware giving cybercriminals a permanent backdoor into your account , but it does n't stop malware from spying on your activities online and seeing what 's happening on your screen . '' Regardless of security concerns , Facebook believes that adding a one-time password ( you have to text 'otp ' to 32665 on your phone to receive a password ) will make it safer to use public computers in places like hotels , cafes or airports . Remote sign-out The remote sign out is an interesting one , given the amount of time people log on at home , then also at work . You just go to account settings and follow the instructions to 'end activity ' of that device . The updating of security information may be a pain for some , but Facebook seems to be trying to highlight the importance of regularly changing passwords and relevant information like up-to-date email addresses . For more on the new safety features at Facebook , go to Blog.facebook.com .
Facebook app download patterns display a distinct `` herding instinct '' amongst users on Mark Zuckerberg 's massively popular online social network . The sheep-like behaviour of Facebook users was outlined in a new study of the download rates of a set of apps for Facebook . The authors of the research in PNAS ( Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the US ) describe the nature of what they call the `` spontaneous emergence of social influence in online systems . '' The popularity threshold The research shows that apps advertised to the Facebook community grew fairly slowly in popularity . However , when a specific app or game reaches a certain level of `` popularity threshold '' then downloads began to skyrocket . The study is based on data gathered in mid-2007 , at a time when Facebook had 2,720 apps and 50 million users . Researchers Jukka-Pekka Onnela and Felix Reed-Tsochas looked at anonymised data relating to the downloading of all the apps over 50 days . `` The surprising finding is that two qualitatively different behavioural patterns emerged , '' Dr Onnela told the BBC . `` There appeared to be a threshold of popularity , and users only seemed to be influenced by the choices of others for apps lying above this threshold . `` Social influence is strongly present in online cultural consumption but , at least in this case , only for a subset of products .

Steve Ballmer revealed his problems with the iPad and his love for mobile phones in an interview this week . Speaking to Cnet , Ballmer explained that the iPad was a decent device but not for everyone . When asked about the iPad he noted that he sees too many of the devices around , explaining : `` You certainly see more than I would like . One is more than I would like . '' When queried on the iPad 's form factor he said : `` Someone who wants to sit and do an interview and take notes and scroll around , they are unlikely to find that device very comfortable . `` It does n't stand up on its own . It does n't have a big screen and keyboard . `` I 'm not taking anything away from what Apple has done and certainly we have our work cut out for us . '' I 'm on the phone Ballmer also explained his love for phones and how his mobile is a key device for him , which is not that surprising given the interview took place was at a Windows Phone 7 event . That aside , Ballmer explained how he uses his phone : `` There 's very little I wo n't do when I am on my phone , '' he noted . `` I certainly do the typical email . I make phone calls , not surprisingly , a lot of them and I do n't want those phone calls dropped . I actually am fairly active on Facebook . '' `` I actually am fairly active on Facebook '' sounds like a Ron Burgundy boast ( `` I 'm kind of a big deal '' ) but it does show the importance of mobile connectivity for the Microsoft boss . He continued : `` I do , in fact , travel a lot , so the fact that I can take my Office with me is important . `` And I can take some videos to watch and music to listen to . It 's all great for me as a mobile person . '' So there you have it . Ballmer is a mobile person , who is fairly active on Facebook and has a phobia of iPads because they do n't stand up on their own . Via TechEye

Facebook has announced a raft of new features that have been designed to give users more control over how they use their Facebook pages , including a redesign of the Groups feature . It has long been a gripe that you ca n't send out status updates to select groups of people ( telling friends how hungover you are , but not your work colleagues ) . This has now been fixed , with Mark Zuckerberg , he of Simpsons and The Social Network fame , noting in a blog post : `` We 've long heard that people would find Facebook more useful if it were easier to connect with smaller groups of their friends instead of always sharing with everyone they know . `` For some it 's their immediate family and for others it 's their fantasy football league , but the common concern is always some variant of , ' I 'd share this thing , but I do n't want to bother 250 people . Or my grandmother . Or my boss ' . `` We set out to build a solution that could help you map out all of your communities , that would be simple enough that everyone would use it and that would be deeply integrated across Facebook and applications so you can communicate with your different groups in lots of different ways . '' Now the Groups feature means you can fence off communities easier on Facebook , make them closed and share whatever information you like – including IM , images and you can even treat the group as an email list . Download data As well as overhauling the groups , Facebook is now giving users the opportunity do download everything they have ever updated to the site . `` We 've built an easy way to quickly download to your computer everything you 've ever posted on Facebook and all your correspondences with friends : your messages , Wall posts , photos , status updates and profile information , '' said Zuckerberg . `` If you want a copy of the information you 've put on Facebook for any reason , you can click a link and easily get a copy of all of it in a single download . `` To protect your information , this feature is only available after confirming your password and answering appropriate security questions . We 'll begin rolling out this feature to people later today , and you 'll find it under your account settings . '' This will be great when the high-quality image viewer rolls out , as you will be able to store your images on the site Flickr-style and download them whenever you want at a later date . Private showing The final update is to do with privacy . A new dashboard for applications is being rolled out which hopes to add transparency into how your data is being used by apps . Here you will be able to change how much data apps can gain about you . There 's talk that this new wave of rollouts is part of on-going changes which will soon culminate in another redesign of the site .

Steve Ballmer has insisted that the likes of Facebook Places and FourSquare represent 'small innovations ' in the future of cloud computing , but believes that they can still make their mark . Location-based software , popularised by FourSquare and now becoming part of Facebook , represent the 'early part of the game ' in terms of what cloud computing and smart devices can do , according to Microsoft 's CEO . But Ballmer told the London School of Economics that even small changes can have a profound effect on the world . Small innovation `` FourSquare and Facebook Places are really a small innovation , '' said Ballmer . `` But small innovations can have a big impact if they change the way we think about the world . '' Ballmer reiterated his belief that smart devices are still needed , even if cloud computing allows people to harness the power of the internet . `` The cloud wants smarter devices , said Ballmer . `` I think that 's 100 per cent obvious now . `` There was this thought that devices would get dumber as computing power moved back into the cloud , but people want smarter devices that connect them to the cloud in intelligent ways .

David Fincher 's 'The Social Network ' ( or , as many are referring to it , 'that Facebook movie ' ) has topped the US box-office charts in its opening weekend , generating over $ 23 million ( £14.59 million ) and garnering plenty of highly positive reviews from leading critics . Fincher 's The Social Network has already received an outstanding 97 per cent review on Rotten Tomatoes ( `` a riveting , ambitious example of modern filmmaking at its finest '' ) and plenty more impressively positive reviews . Check-in at the movies Facebook itself hosted its own screening for employees last Friday , with many using Facebook Places to check in at the special company event . It will be interesting to see how the movie fares over the coming weeks and months , with a UK launch scheduled for Friday 15 October . The Social Network is estimated to have cost Sony Pictures in the range of $ 45 million to $ 52 million . Sony expects at least $ 100 million in total revenues from the flick .

Facebook has announced a raft of new features to its Photo service , upgrading the picture quality of images and making it easier to share photos . Browsing and tagging have also been improved , with Facebook introducing `` a better photo viewer '' . The new viewer simplifies navigation of photos , and the frame around the images has been darkened to highlight the picture more . It also means that you do n't have to go onto a new page to view photos , as the image opens in the centre of the screen . Bulk tagging has been added , so you can tag multiple photos of the same person / event a lot easier . Photo improvements The biggest improvement , however , is in picture quality . Images will now be shown as 720 pixels to 2048 pixels , which is a whopping eight times bigger than what the site delivers at the moment . You can download images easier too , by simply clicking on the Download link option . Sam Odio from Facebook says about the release : `` When we originally got started on Photos , we only had two people working on it . `` We did n't build out a lot of features ; we just focused on making sure photos were easy to share and this made Photos a great social experience . But we also wanted to give people on Facebook the best quality photo product on the web… So I 'm excited to announce three big improvements to Photos . '' The new and improved Facebook Photo will be available to the public sometime this month . If you want to see the service in action , though , then head over the National Geographic Facebook page .

President George W. Bush is taking a leaf out of Barack Obama 's book , by using Facebook to get his point across ... well , to flog his book at least . The former US Commander in Chief sat down with CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the Facebook Live channel this evening to promote his memoirs Decision Points , which was released earlier this month . Facebook users were encouraged to send their own questions into the 43rd President , who kick-started the interview by saying , `` They did n't think I could read , let alone write ! '' `` I 'm an iPad guy '' In a rather surreal interview with Zuckerberg , Bush said he used no tech and gadgets while President , but claimed that his administration was the first to use email . He said he refrained from using it himself so his words could not be taken out of context . He added : `` When I left office and went back to Crawford , Texas , I became a BlackBerry person , but now I 'm an iPad person and I use the Facebook to stay in touch with people who are interested in me . '' Dubya also took the opportunity to rip on Zuckerberg for not graduating from college , while congratulating him on the success of Facebook and its use as a freedom fighting tool around the world . Bush set up a Facebook page in June to promote his book and various personal appearances . So far he has 600,000 fans . Obama currently has 16.8 million . Keep on truckin ' George .
An application that claims to offer people the capacity to see who has been looking at their Facebook profiles is spreading virally and giving access to the accounts that are foolish enough to sign up to the scam . The message `` OMG OMG OMG ... I cant believe this actually works ! Now you really can see who viewed your profile ! '' is whizzing across Facebook , as people try to sign up and give permissions to use their account . These Facebook scams are obviously very common , but this is a successful one purely because of the type of offer being made . Who viewed my Facebook profile ? People have been desperate to learn who is checking them out on Facebook since the site arrived , but is something that the social network ( very sensibly ) blocks . According to the Sophos security blog , this latest scam takes anyone who clicks the link though to the permissions page , and the moment people say yes to , effectively , handing over the keys to their social kingdom it will propagate the very link that the user had clicked on through their own account . It 's an obvious scam , but it 's likely to lure thousands into its obvious trap and once again reminds us that you can not repeat enough the advice : `` do n't click random links offering suspiciously favourable things online '' .

Facebook has made some serious steps in protecting its brand by showing its intent to trademark the word Face . A Notice of Allowance has been granted to the social-networking site , which is the first step in taking ownership of the use of Face in certain circumstances . The Notice of Allowance states that , if successful , Facebook would be the only ones who can use the word Face for the following : `` Telecommunication services , namely , providing online chat rooms and electronic bulletin boards for transmission of messages among computer users in the field of general interest and concerning social and entertainment subject matter , none primarily featuring or relating to motoring or to cars . '' Facing facts Facebook now have three months to pay a fee and then it can start trademark proceedings . Considering that Apple currently uses the word Face for its Facetime service – which must fall under the banner of 'telecommunication ' – it will be interesting to see if this would be encroaching on the soon-to-be Facebook trademark . And let 's not get started on what the A-Team will do if the trademark becomes a reality .

Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the world wide web , has said that social networking sites such as Facebook are guilty of limiting the potential openness of the web . Tim Berners-Lee outlined his concerns in a piece in the Scientific American journal , entitled Long Live the Web : A Call for Continued Open Standards and Neutrality . Web 's egalitarian principles `` The web evolved into a powerful , ubiquitous tool because it was built on egalitarian principles and because thousands of individuals , universities and companies have worked , both independently and together as part of the World Wide Web Consortium , to expand its capabilities based on those principles , '' said Berners-Lee in an impassioned call for openness online . Saying that , Berners-Lee is also increasingly concerned that the open and democratic nature of the web was under threat by some of its more recent and `` most successful inhabitants '' such as Facebook , LinkedIn and Friendster . `` Facebook , LinkedIn , Friendster and others typically provide value by capturing information as you enter it : your birthday , your e-mail address , your likes , and links indicating who is friends with whom and who is in which photograph , '' said the web pioneer . `` The sites assemble these bits of data into brilliant databases and reuse the information to provide value-added service - but only within their sites . Once you enter your data into one of these services , you can not easily use them on another site . `` Each site is a silo , walled off from the others . Yes , your site 's pages are on the web , but your data are not . You can access a web page about a list of people you have created in one site , but you can not send that list , or items from it , to another site . '' Berners-Lee added that cable companies can also stop information flowing freely on the web , noting : `` Cable television companies that sell internet connectivity are considering whether to limit their internet users to downloading only the company 's mix of entertainment .

MySpace has teamed up with Facebook in a ground-breaking move to gain and keep users , in addition to countering the threat from Apple 's new 'Ping ' social network . News Corporation owned MySpace and Facebook have announced 'Mashup with Facebook ' this week to allow MySpace users to log into their Facebook accounts directly from their MySpace page . This will allow users to port over their likes and interests from Facebook and then receive relevant streams of entertainment from MySpace dependent upon these likes and preferences . The mashup is an updated version of MySpace Sync , which was announced back in August , and confirms reports that MySpace was planning a big link-up with its rival Facebook . Complimentary services `` We feel this is a complementary service to Facebook , '' said MySpace chief exec Mike Jones . `` This new feature is a great illustration of our strategy around social entertainment and enabling the real-time stream . '' Facebook 's VP of partnerships Dan Rose said the sharing of info with MySpace `` makes a lot of sense . '' Rose adds : `` Sharing entertainment and music interests is part of many of our friendships , online and off . `` MySpace is giving people an easy way to bring their favourite bands , celebrities and movies from Facebook to create a personalised experience on MySpace from the start . '' Forrester Research analyst Augie Ray opined : `` People have come to think of MySpace in a certain way and while I do n't think this deal will help them attract a lot of users it is necessary that those people on the site enjoy the MySpace experience and I think this helps . `` This is also a good opportunity for Facebook to demonstrate that the information you have about yourself and about your friends belongs to you . In many respects this is about Facebook changing attitudes over ownership of data than anything else . '' Five years left for Facebook ? Speaking at an Australian web conference this week , Dr Jeffrey Cole – who five years ago predicted the demise of MySpace – said that Facebook has around five years left . `` The same thing will happen to Facebook but it 's going to take a lot longer , '' said Dr Cole , a director of the World Internet project . `` And it 's not going to be replaced by one big social networking community but it 's going to fragment . '' That said , Facebook has gained more than 50 million new users in the past year according to online metrics firm comScore . Which means Facebook currently has 620 million users worldwide . More than 33 million people in the UK use Facebook , according to the latest figures . MySpace has just under 3 million UK users and 91 million users worldwide , making it the fourth biggest social network in the world right now . Via BBC News

MySpace is preparing itself to link-up with Facebook , with news that the site is to integrate Facebook Connect into its pages . This will mark a significant change for the service , which was the social network of choice before Facebook arrived and stole most of its thunder . MySpace is significantly repositioning itself , however , as an entertainment hub and becoming something of a social recluse . In a statement it told the Telegraph last week that it `` is a not a social network anymore . It is now a social entertainment destination . '' FaceSpace Severe losses , which have been called not sustainable by owners News Corp , and dwindling users have prompted a serious rethink about the site and it seems that using Facebook 's service for third parties - that allows users to 'connect ' their Facebook identity and friends to any site - is part of this . Although MySpace has n't confirmed that this is part of its plans , a number of people at the Web 2.0 Summit have , with one noting : `` MySpace are going to install a Facebook Connect button across the site , but no one at the company can admit it publicly yet . They have to . `` They need the same audience to come to MySpace , that now goes to Facebook , if their re-launch to a social entertainment portal is going to have any traction . '' Considering it 's rumoured that MySpace 's UK traffic is around 3.3 million , compared to Facebook 's 26 million – this does seem to be the case .

There 's a whole lot more to Facebook than poking people , sharing your status and commenting on photos . Applications make Facebook into a wider social site where you can play games , enjoy common interests , and share gifts . Most applications are provided by third parties who have developed them according to Facebook 's guidelines . As with applications that you run on your computer , you need to ensure that they 're trustworthy before giving them access to your information . You can find new apps to install in the Application Directory . You 'll find Facebook recommendations , plus information on which of your friends use each application . Use the search bar to look for apps by name , or browse through the categories in the left-hand column . You may also receive invitations from friends to start using particular applications , but check them out before accepting by visiting the app 's profile page . Applications have profile pages similar to your own , which give information about the application and show other users ' reviews . Select the app from the Directory to see its profile , and go to the Info tab to read the information provided by the developer . If you also want to find out what other users think about this application , click the Reviews tab . If you 're happy with what you see , return to the application 's wall and click `` Go to Application '' . Click Allow , to permit the application to access your data , and it will now appear in your list of applications on your profile . Select the application to go to it . Bookmark your favourites You can add as many apps as you like , although not all will appear on your profile page . If you want to ensure an application appears in the left-hand column simply bookmark it – in the top right-hand corner of the page , click Account > Application Settings . Pick the app to bookmark in the list and choose Edit Settings . Click the bookmark tab and select bookmark . If you subsequently decide you do n't want to continue using an application , you can remove it . Go to the Account drop-down menu in the top-right of the page and choose Application Settings . Find the application that you want to remove and click the X to its right , then click OK to confirm it . You can also make a dedicated tab for a particular application if you like it , by clicking the + icon to the right of your existing tabs on your profile . Select the application you want to add from the list , or search for more options . 1 . Lexulous Lexulous is a fun word game that follows very similar rules to Scrabble . You can play against friends or challenge random strangers to beat your word power . You 're given seven random letters and you need to create words that fit into the growing grid . Click and drag the letters from your hand onto the board , and you 'll score more for double and triple letter or word scores . It 's currently one of the best-loved applications on Facebook and can be a huge time-sink because it 's so addictive . 2 . Picnik Given Facebook 's aptitude for sharing photos with friends , it makes sense to also have a photo-editing tool available on hand for quick image fixes . Picnik provides you with access to its online photo-editing directly within Facebook . You can crop , rotate , resize and colour-balance your photos , or remove red-eye . It 's ideal to use on pictures that you 've emailed in or sent from a mobile , where you would n't normally have editing features . Picnik also enables you to browse and edit any photo you 're tagged in . 3 . Flixster Flixster is designed for movie-lovers to discuss films they 've seen with Facebook friends and fellow cinema-goers . The application helps you keep up with the latest releases in cinemas and on DVD , and you can rate the movies you 've already seen . Plus you can flag films you want to see , so you can arrange to watch them with other friends using the application . Flixster also includes thousands of movie trivia quizzes that you can complete , and challenge friends to beat your score . 4 . Trip Advisor : Cities I 've visited Share your travel experiences with your friends and help them decide where to go and what to do when they venture out in the world with TripAdvisor . There 's an element of travel-boasting involved , where you mark which cities on a map of the world that you 've visited , but you can also note those that you know well enough to advise others on . More importantly , you can fl ag places that you 'd like to visit , and benefit from the wisdom and experience of your other friends who 've already been there . 5 . Where I 've Been Similar to Trip Advisor 's application , Where I 've Been extends beyond the list of your frequently visited cities and enables you to note down everywhere you 've been in the world . You can post reviews of places for the benefit of the whole community , or become an expert on a particular place if you 'd like to advise others . Where I 've Been comes well-tipped by members of the travel industry , and so it goes beyond simply flaunting your travel experience to become a research tool in itself . 6 . Twitter Link your Twitter account to your Facebook profile and get two social networks for the price of one . You can use the Twitter app to find and follow those of your Facebook friends that also use Twitter . You can also set the application to automatically post your tweets to update your Facebook status . It will ignore @ replies and direct messages , however , to prevent your status getting clogged up with Twitter conversations . Use the application to encourage Facebook friends to find and follow you on Twitter . 7 . PuzzleBee PuzzleBee suits jigsaw lovers everywhere . Use it to create new jigsaws from your own Facebook photos , or compete against other users to finish the `` jigsaw of the day '' puzzle in the shortest time . Unlike other online puzzles , you can rotate pieces as well as move them around , and you can change the number of pieces in each puzzle to alter the level of difficulty . As you complete different puzzles you move up the hierarchy , in a quest to progress from Baby Bee to Queen PuzzleBee . 8 . DivShare The DivShare application links your Facebook account to its online storage service , so you can use it to share documents , photos , music and videos with your friends . It enables you to link your files with your profile , or post them on friends ' walls . You can even share them in your news feed . Files can be up to 200MB in size and you can have unlimited storage space on the DivShare servers . You can host anything that meets the terms of service for free , as long as your account lasts , and you do n't have to register . 9 . Web Sudoku Web Sudoku provides you with a new Sudoku puzzle to play within Facebook every day . Enter numbers one to nine in the blank squares , without repeating any in a row , column or block . The puzzles come from Web Sudoku , which is the most popular Sudoku site on the internet . You can change the level of difficulty as you improve – puzzles come in easy , medium , hard or evil levels . When you complete a puzzle you can compare your time with your friends , or see how you rank against all Web Sudoku players . 10 . Market Place Why sell your second-hand items to strangers using eBay ? Instead you can advertise them to people who you know and trust within your group of Facebook friends , using Market Place . You can use it to advertise stuff you want to give away for free , or set up a classified-style listing for items that are worth money . You can also use it to find articles for sale within a specified distance of your location , and sift through listings to find tickets to events , housing , cars and even jobs advertised .
The `` future of modern messaging '' - that 's what Facebook is calling its new Facebook Messages service . The revamped feature brings your email , IMs , Facebook messages and texts into one seamless inbox . In theory , Facebook Messages enables various forms of communication to take place on Facebook - even texts . We 're interested to see how that works in practice but , for now , Facebook has given us these images to give us a feel for the new offering . When the new Messages service is available for you , you 'll see the below message . Alternatively , you might see this new Messages splash screen if you click on the Messages sidebar link . Here 's the email setup screen . You 'll see new messages appear much as before - all of your messages are integrated into a single , continuous thread . Messages from friends are prioritised and that everything else goes into a separate 'other ' folder - rather like Gmail 's new Priority Inbox . There are also other enhancements such as adding or removing people from threads , sending attachments or forwarding messages . You can also choose to receive texts into Facebook - choose your country , then your carrier . Facebook says Messages will also have the following features :
Microsoft has announced that the arrival of Facebook 's messaging platform also brings in another significant addition – with Office documents now accessible from your Facebook page . Facebook 's new messaging platform – which Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg described as the `` future of modern messaging '' – not only brings together instant messaging , texts , mail and Facebook messages , but also can incorporate Microsoft Word , Excel , and PowerPoint documents via Office Web Apps . Microsoft 's corporate VP of Office , Takeshi Numoto , blogged : `` Facebook 's new messaging platform integrates the Office Web Apps to enable Facebook users to view Microsoft Word , Excel , and PowerPoint documents with just one click . Share ideas `` As you know , Office helps you create stunning documents that bring your ideas to life . Now you can easily share those ideas with your friends and family on Facebook , '' he added `` I 'm really excited about being able to make it even easier for people to use Office to access and share information across different devices , networks and platforms . `` With the Office Web Apps on Facebook , you have even more ways to express yourself with Office and easily share your thoughts with people that are important to you . '' View on Office.com Essentially , when you receive a Facebook message with an Office doc attachment – you have the option to 'View on Office.com ' or 'Download ' allowing you to access the data . `` So go ahead ! Create a personalized invitation to your dinner party next Saturday with Word or share that killer PowerPoint presentation you delivered for your school project , '' added Numoto . `` Let your ideas run free and inspire you to create something unique and share it on Facebook using Office. ``

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced the `` future of modern messaging '' by launching a service that brings your email , IMs , Facebook messages and texts into one seamless portal . The service , which could potentially change the way we think about email , will allow users to view communications from all devices in one conversation history for each of your friends . In theory , the new messaging service previously known as Project Titan , will allow our every technological correspondence to take place , and be recorded , on Facebook . The company will also offer each of its 500m users an @ facebook.com email address based on their profile name , but insists the new service is not based around email . Conversation history Zuckerberg says the multiple thread model used by Gmail is `` archaic '' and that the new service will provide a `` full , rich history with each of your friends '' that is one continuous conversation across many platforms . The example used at the media event was the ability to chronicle an entire relationship history `` from 'hi , nice to meet you ' , to 'hey it 's your turn to pick up the kids from soccer practice tonight , ' '' pulling together emails , texts and IMs . Another aspect of the new service is called Social Inbox , which ensures that users only see messages that they care about , while doing a better job than a spam filter of blocking out unwanted content by giving users greater control over who they receive messages from . Not an email killer Zuckerberg says the service is n't an email killer , but a new messaging service of which email is a part . He reckons it represents a seismic shift from email to simpler , more informal services like Facebook chat . The service will be rolled out to users , slowly , over the next few months.The bottom line is that we 're probably going to be spending much more of our time on Facebook .

The war of words between Facebook and Google is raging on , with the search giant now urging people to think twice before exporting their contents into the social networking behemoth . The once-amicable relationship between the two has turned decidedly frosty of late – with Google upset that it allowed Facebook to comb through its Google Contacts data to find friends for new sign ups for the social network , but that the share was not reciprocated . That saw Google change its terms and conditions so that it could stop Facebook doing just this , and this in turn prompted Facebook to use a workaround . Redirection However , now Google is redirecting people using this workaround to a page that questions Facebook 's lack of openness . `` Hold on a second . Are you super sure you want to import your contact information for your friends into a service that wo n't let you get it out ? '' reads the contacts export confirm webpage . `` Here 's the not-so-fine print . You have been directed to this page from a site that does n't allow you to re-export your data to other services , essentially locking up your contact data about your friends . `` So once you import your data there , you wo n't be able to get it out . We think this is an important thing for you to know before you import your data there . `` Although we strongly disagree with this data protectionism , the choice is yours . Because , after all , you should have control over your data . `` Of course , you are always free to download your contacts using the export feature in Google Contacts . `` This public service announcement is brought to you on behalf of your friends in Google Contacts . '' As it happens , Facebook unleashes its webmail service next week – a direct competitor to Gmail , so do n't expect the two former friends to play nicely in the sandpit for some time to come .

FarmVille still sits astride the top of the Facebook app charts , closely followed by the recently launched Windows Live Messenger app from Microsoft . The latest Facebook app data comes courtesy of AppData 's Facebook app top , which shows that over 16 million people are still tending their virtual FarmVille crops every day . Perennial Facebook favourites Other games in the top ten include perennial favourites such as Texas HoldEm Poker , FrontierVille and Café World . Perhaps one of the biggest surprises is the massive popularity of Microsoft 's instant messenger app Windows Live Messenger – which is the second most popular app in the Facebook app chart right now , with over 9 million daily active users . This follows Microsoft 's latest release of Windows Live Messenger featuring full integration of Facebook chat earlier this autumn . Microsoft claims that only around 20 per cent of Messenger users currently have access the Facebook chat integration feature . Facebook , meet Microsoft Dharmesh Mehta posts more details on the growth of the Facebook-Microsoft partnership over on the Windows Live blog : `` In the last few updates , we made a number of changes across Windows Live that made it both more valuable to connect Facebook to Windows Live , and easier for you to do this . `` We 're still early in the release , but to date , over 10 million people have connected their Facebook accounts with Windows Live . One thing that excites us about this is not only the scale of this adoption but the fact that it is already 6 times more than we saw in all of Wave 3 ( our previous set of releases ) . '' You can see more details online relating to the various options for connecting Windows Live to Facebook . `` We 're excited to see how this is continuing to grow as more people connect their Windows Live accounts to Facebook and as we begin to offer chat integration in more countries , '' adds Mehta . `` On the PC side , many device manufacturers and retailers are choosing to pre-install Windows Live Essentials on their new Windows 7 PCs – helping bring together a complete Windows experience . `` We 're continuing to work with these partners to make this possible , and we expect over 100 million new consumer PCs to ship with Windows Live Essentials next year .

Facebook 's online advertising business is booming , with Mark Zuckerberg 's social network running nearly one in four online display ads in the US . Facebook now owns a healthy 23.1 per cent share of display ad impressions in the US , up from 17.7 per cent in the last quarter of 2010 . Facebook races ahead It puts Facebook at nearly double the number two ranked company , Yahoo , which has an 11 per cent share of America 's online display ads right now . The latest figures showing Facebook 's growing slice of the online advertising pie come from a new report by Web analytics firm comScore , showing that Facebook 's website totalled more ad impressions than Yahoo , Microsoft , Google and Fox Interactive media combined . Facebook delivered 297 billion impressions of display ads in the US in the third quarter of 2010 , according to comScore . Evercore Partners analyst Ken Sena 's estimates that the effective CPM ( cost per thousand impressions ) for Facebook 's US display ads is around $ 1 , compared with a $ 3 CPM for display ads on Yahoo 's sites . `` It certainly is an issue for the portal sites , '' said Sena . `` While you still have the sort of traditional display players benefiting from strong growth trends in display ( advertising ) , social is probably taking a disproportionate share of that growth . '' The US online display ad market is expected to grow by around 13 per cent to $ 8.56 billion in 2010 , according to eMarketer . Via Reuters

Facebook 's head of mobile has claimed that Android and other mobile platforms are now just as important as the iPhone to the social network . Some consumers have claimed that Apple users always get access to the best Facebook Mobile features , like being the first to try out Places , but Henri Moissinac told TechRadar that it 's simply a case of what works best for each platform : `` Of course , we want to deploy [ all features ] across all platforms at once , but in the past we 've done things first on the iPhone and then tested to see what happens . `` Yesterday was the first time we launched two at once [ new applications for the iPhone and Android ] , but we do n't have a magic want to update all platforms at once ; if you ask any developer trying to synchronise across all at once is very hard . `` It 's not that the iPhone has all the best features , for instance you ca n't share directly from taking a picture or sync contacts to your address book - in that case Windows Phone 7 is best . `` But until we can get a much larger engineering team or a magic wand [ there will always be disparity in places ] . '' Combined future Moissinac also said that the desktop and mobile applications would always co-exist , although some users have migrated almost exclusively onto mobile : `` Comparing the mobile and web versions of the site , there are some users that are mobile only , or might only check on a PC ever six weeks or so . `` There has been some cannibalisation from the likes of iPhone or Android users , but when you look at the metrics both formats are still on the increase , so we see a world when the world is both web and mobile together . ''
The increasingly frosty relationship between Facebook and Google has grown a little colder , with the search giant making a change to its terms and conditions that will stop the social networking site having access to your email contacts . Facebook has previously been allowed to comb through your Gmail contacts to find potential matches , but Google is unhappy that its openness is not being reciprocated . A change to the site 's Terms of Service – as reported on TechCrunch – means that any site that wants to use the Google Contacts API has to offer reciprocity . Pulled the plug Facebook does not allow the export of contact information for your friends – and this means that Google has pulled the plug . `` Google is committed to making it easy for users to get their data into and out of Google products , '' said a Google statement . `` That is why we have a data liberation engineering team dedicated to building import and export tools for users . `` We are not alone . Many other sites allow users to import and export their information , including contacts , quickly and easily . But sites that do not , such as Facebook , leave users in a data dead end . `` So we have decided to change our approach slightly to reflect the fact that users often are n't aware that once they have imported their contacts into sites like Facebook they are effectively trapped . '' Ways and means There are still ways and means for users to export their own contacts and then convert them into a file that Facebook can read - although this is obviously a major hurdle for the average person and some way away from the convenience of the previous method . `` Google users will still be free to export their contacts from our products to their computers in an open , machine-readable format – and once they have done that they can then import those contacts into any service they choose , added Google `` However , we will no longer allow websites to automate the import of users ' Google Contacts ( via our API ) unless they allow similar export to other sites . '' This will be a major , although by no means critical , blow for Facebook – with its huge user base having already used the tool previously and dels with Yahoo and Microsoft ( Hotmail ) meaning they will not close off their contacts to the social networking giant . We 're guessing that Mark Zuckerberg may not be receiving a Christmas card from Larry and Sergei this year .

The Facebook app for Android is finally getting a facelift to include the Places functionality seen on its iPhone counterpart , while also adding Groups . Android owners will now be able to check-in at their current location on Facebook using their handset 's GPS signal using Places . This will allow those using Android to capitalise on the new Places Deals service announced at Facebook 's mobile event this evening . Back on track The refreshed app is a welcome boost for Android users who 've long bemoaned how poor the Facebook portal is compared to the iPhone iteration . `` Traditionally the Android app has always been a little bit behind , '' said Mark Zuckerberg . `` We did n't have a full team working on it , but now we 're back on track . '' The iPhone app itself also got a lick of paint , with users now able to geo-tag photos using Places , while both platforms will be able to access their Facebook Groups from within the app . The new apps will be available to download from their respective stores shortly .
Facebook has refreshed its mobile web offering to include single sign-on functionality for social apps and has expanded the reach of Facebook Places to include location-based deals . Quashing rumours that Facebook will launch its own phone . CEO Mark Zuckerberg used a special mobile event to launch three new features for the site 's 200m mobile web users . Facebook mobile users now have a one-touch `` single sign-on '' portal for social apps , games and sites using their Facebook login , rather than having to sign-up and log-in to each . Places comes of age Facebook Places , which allows users to tag their location , has also been opened up to developers to allow them to build the API in any social location application , including Foursquare and Loopt . The third and final improvement also uses Places to allow local businesses to easily create special deals for Facebook users , like discounted meals or services . Users will be able to check-in , cash-in the deal and then share it with friends on Facebook.com . Here 's how it 'll work . One of the first deals will be from Gap , who will be offering 10,000 free pairs of blue jeans for Facebook users and 40 per cent off for those beyond that if you check in at the store . Deals are only available in the US at the moment , but will be rolled-out internationally in due course . No Facebook Phone So not exactly the bombshell Facebook Phone many were hoping for , but some decent Foursquare-like upgrades for the mobile platforms . CEO Mark Zuckerberg told a group of bloggers and developers : `` There 's a rumour floating around that Facebook is going to build a phone . No . `` Our goal is to make everything social . Our phone is no matter how many platforms you 're building for that our app is social . The approach that we have and what we 're going to stick with for a while . `` We want a lot of the eco system not built by us . '' Privacy ? While these developments are sure to enhance user experience , we can foresee another privacy storm coming , with more third parties having access to Facebook logins and user locations . Zuckerberg says `` Nothing has changed '' with single sign-on , and that user permissions will still be required for third parties to gain access to user location .
Mega-publisher Electronic Arts has signed an exclusive five-year deal for its games to use Facebook 's virtual Facebook Credits currency for its games hosted on the social network . EA already has a number of popular gaming titles on Facebook , such as Pet Society , Monopoly , and Restaurant City . `` Since gaming has emerged as the most popular category of applications on Facebook , the natural next step is for EA to broaden its relationship with Facebook and its 500 million users , '' said Barry Cottle , senior vice president and general manager for EA Interactive . 70/30 revenue split EA will receive Facebook 's 70 per cent revenue share from Facebook Credits transactions . Facebook gets the other 30 per cent cut . Gamers will use the credits to play EA games and buy virtual goods within the game-worlds . Facebook gaming darlings Zynga ( they of FarmVille fame ) signed its own five-year deal with Facebook in back September . Facebook has also made similar five-year deals with other gaming developers including Playdom ( owned by Walt Disney ) and Crowdstar .
Google and Facebook may soon face a new government-backed privacy code in the UK . The new Google and Facebook privacy code has been proposed by UK Culture minister Ed Vaizey this week . Privacy code update The minister wants to see the development of a clearer and concise current code for the way online search and social networks deal with issues of individual 's privacy online Vaizey wants to see updates to the current UK code for privacy online used by the Information Commissioner 's Office . For its part , Facebook has said it `` looks forward to hearing more '' about Vaizey 's proposals for improving our online privacy in Britain . As do the rest of us ! The proposed code of conduct would give British citizens greater redress against online search and social networks if they felt that their privacy had been unduly breached or invaded , explained Vaizey . Facebook said of government proposals : `` We look forward to hearing more about Mr Vaizey 's plans and continuing to work with both him and the ICO . '' Google is still to respond to the issue . TechRadar has contacted the company for further comment . Via The Guardian

The Winklevoss twins are attempting to sue Mark Zuckerberg for apparently stealing the idea for Facebook from them yet again , despite already being offered a $ 65 million ( £41.85 million ) settlement The 'Winkelvii ' ( as Jesse Eisenberg 's character refers to them in The Social Network ) claim to have originally come up with the idea for Facebook , which they claim Mark Zuckerberg stole from them while at Harvard University . Unhappy Winklevii Seemingly unsatisfied with being offered $ 65 million as a pay-off already , it seems that the twins feel that there is a principle at stake here . Hence Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are suing Facebook in Federal Court again , The pair told the New York Times how they plan to pursue Zuckerberg in US courts until they feel justice is done . The Winklevii recount in interminable detail how they first met Zuckerberg in the infamous Kirkland House dining room , the layout of Zuckerberg 's Harvard dorm and how they feel he stole the basic idea for Facebook from a website concept they had called Harvard Connection . Beyond all that rather dull detail , the twins also claim that Facebook has violated the US Securities Act of 1934 when it drew up the original settlement deal for $ 65 million . All good fodder for The Social Network 2 , perhaps ? Via Valleywag

Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has re-filed a more detailed version of a lawsuit originally filed earlier in 2010 , claiming that several high-profile tech firms are guilty of patent infringement – including Google , Facebook and Apple . Allen 's Interval Licensing , the patent arm of Interval Research , filed the revised patent infringement lawsuit against these big-hitting tech giants this week . The US district court told Allen 's lawyers that Interval had until December 28 to refile the lawsuit , which is exactly what they have done . Patently hopping mad The new lawsuit includes numerous screengrabs of websites and services that Interval claim shows infringement on its patents . The lawsuit accuses Apple , Facebook , eBay , Netflix , AOL , Yahoo ! , Office Depot , OfficeMax , YouTube and Staples of infringing on four patents held by Interval Licensing that relate to e-commerce and online search functions . FOSS Patents ' analysis of the patent complaint by notes that Google 's Android operating system – and its notification system for texts , Google Voice messages , emails and other alerts `` to a user of a mobile device in an unobtrusive manner that occupies the peripheral attention of the user '' – is directly under fire from Allen 's lawsuit . `` If any of those infringement assertions against Android [ are ] true , this can spell trouble for makers of Android-based devices , and for Android application developers , '' notes FOSS Patent 's Florian Mueller . `` Patent holders can choose to sue Google , device makers , application developers , users , or any combination of the foregoing options . '' Expect to hear a lot more on developments in Paul Allen 's patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook , Apple , Google , and others as this particular tech patent drama plays itself out in court in the coming weeks .

Data crimped from Facebook has found that if you want people to Like your status and become your friend , then writing about sports and music is the key . Facebook looked at 1 million status updates ( stop seething , they were all anonymous ) and found that those who were 'popular ' on the site liked to use the pronoun 'you ' and speak about music and sports . It seems that they are also all about themselves , preferring not to speak about their family and they are emotionless in their updates . `` Word usage of more 'popular ' people also differs from people with a lower friend count , '' said Facebook . `` They write longer updates , and use more words referring to music and sports . More 'popular ' people also talk less about their families , are less emotional overall , use fewer past tense and present tense verbs and words related to time . '' They sound like idiots to us . A lot of negativity Facebook also found that if you use negative comments in your update , then this will garner less Likes but it will increase comments . `` Positive emotional updates receive fewer comments – perhaps there 's nothing more to say , '' says Facebook . `` Negative emotional updates receive more comments – perhaps as a consolation . '' So if you want to be popular , receive lots of comments and Likes , we suggest you say in your status update : `` I hate sport , music and you . But I really like being liked .

A poll by TechRadar has shown that Facebook is far less trusted than the likes of Microsoft and Google – earning a massive 50 per cent of the vote . More than a 1,000 readers responded on who they trusted least out of Apple , Facebook , Google and Microsoft – four companies that have found themselves under the spotlight for the way in which they handle our personal information . Interestingly , Microsoft 's recent efforts to maintain your privacy appears to have boosted the company in consumer 's eyes – picking up 14 per cent of the vote to be the most trusted of the quartet . Google and Apple level pegging Google has had high profile failings with the likes of the Street View WiFi data collection and the Buzz launch , and yet it polled 17 per cent . That was exactly the same total as Apple , whose iPhone and iPad have boosted the number of people who trust the US company to see their details . Which left a whopping half of those who voted suggesting that it was Facebook that they trusted least with their personal data . Facebook , of course , needs our data to exist , with the drip feed of friend information helping put it neck and neck with Google as one of the most popular sites on the internet . But the litany of failures from Mark Zuckerberg 's site has not convinced any of us that Facebook deserves to be the company with our personal info – although that does n't appear to have stopped us handing it over en masse . Question : Who do you trust least with your data ? Votes cast : 1,187 1 . Facebook 50 % 2 . Apple 17 % 2 . Google 17 % 4 . Microsoft 14 %

Facebook is rolling out a facial recognition tool in order to make tagging your photos a little bit easier . By grouping similar faces together , the new feature will offer you a list of possible posers when you go to tag a photo , saving you the hassle of typing ( or remembering ) friends ' names yourself . Facebook claims that over 100 million photographs are uploaded to the social network every day , so there 's not shortage of face-types to draw on . Sister/Gran How effective facial recognition will be on the more unusual poses remains to be seen ; and no doubt there are some comedy moments waiting to be had when Facebook suggests that your sister be tagged as your gran . The incorporation of facial recognition comes as part of an ongoing effort to improve photo-sharing on the social network . As Facebook 's vice president of product Chris Cox told cnet , `` We wanted to make our photos product not suck . '' Just days after founder Mark Zuckerberg was named Time magazine 's Person of 2010 , Facebook is planning a gradual rollout for the facial recognition tool with 5 % of users set to receive it next week .

Facebook 1.5 has launched for Android mobile phones , bringing push notifications and chat . That 's right , very much like the features that iPhone Facebook users have had for a while now ! Got an iPhone ? Remember January ? Yes , nearly a year ago – the month when you received Facebook push notifications on your phone . Push me baby , one more time Yet while your Apple-toting friends may scoff at your choice of smartphone , Android users can at least now use Facebook 's version 1.5 of its Android app which features full chat mode ( with background notifications ) and push notifications , providing you are rocking Android 2.2 or later . However , all is not good in the land of Android Facebook updates quite yet . As the push notifications in the latest Facebook for Android only relate to chat and not to comments and likes and so on . Also , only 43.4 per cent of users are running Android 2.2 , so over half of Android users wil still miss out on push notifications . The Android Facebook app is available for free in the Android marketplace .

Twitter and Facebook have looked through their top trends for the year and come up with what is a decent representation of 2010 , according to social networks . In the top spot for words that appeared on Facebook in 2010 is the acronym 'HMU ' . Now , unless you are au fait with Bieber or know how to whip your hair , you may not know that HMU stand for 'hit me up ' – as in contact me , not punch me in the face . Facebook 's top 10 also has the 'World Cup ' at number 2 , 'iPad and iPhone ' at number 3 and words relating to a variety of real world incidents , including 'Haiti ' ( 5 ) and 'miners ' . Interestingly , Facebook seems to be full of folks who do n't like to live in the now as '2011 ' managed to slip into tenth place on the Facebook Memology list . Trending places Twitter 's trend list is a lot more consistent to the highs ( and lows ) of 2010 . At number 1 is the 'Gulf Oil Spill ' , with 'Inception ' and 'Haiti Earthquake ' close behind . The World Cup bags three mentions in the list . 'Fifa World Cup ' is at number 2 , with 'Vuvuzela ' at 5 and 'Pulpo Paul ' – the octopus who predicted scores – at 10 . Finally , the world was definitely a dark place in 2010 as internet-meme-cum-superstar Justin Bieber gets a mention in both the Twitter and Facebook lists . UPDATE Facebook UK has contacted TechRadar about the UK specific status trends for Facebook and it seems that us Brits prefer Wagner to HMU , David Cameron to Haiti and One Direction to Chilean Miners . The full UK top 10 is below :

Facebook has announced the arrival of the Facebook 2011 Hacker Cup , which calls on those with a hacking brain to come and try and improve the website for cold , hard cash . The Hacker Cup is a worldwide contest that begins in January and is focused on bringing the next big product to Facebook . According to the social-networking site , the 2011 Facebook Hacker Cup is `` the first annual Facebook programming contest where hackers compete against each other for fame , fortune , glory and a shot at the coveted Hacker Cup . '' Algorithm of the night If you look beyond the hyperbole , the reality sounds a little like a school test . But if successfully solving algorithmic-based problem statements sounds like your bag , then there 's prize money at stake . Registration opens 20 December , with a qualification round beginning 7 January . If you are successful , then the top 25 hackers will get flown to Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto , California , with a chance of winning $ 5,000 . Facebook is n't the only one trying to enlist legit hackers . This week Reevoo takes part in a hack week . This involves dozen or more devs locked in a room for a week , in a bid to create something that is world changing . They 're calling it a 'band camp for geeks ' . We 've all seen American Pie , so we know what that entails , then . If they can put the flutes down for a minute , then there may well be a website created - www.justbuythisone.com and http : //spacelog.org/ both came from these type of meetups .

A new way of reading your friends ' news from Facebook , presented in the style of a traditional newspaper , called 'PostPost ' launches this month . PostPost is a news app that takes and develops similar concepts from the likes of Pulse and the popular iPad app Flipboard , to let users effectively become the own editor of the newspaper of their daily lives . 'The Daily You ' PostPost describes itself as a `` social newspaper '' and has been created by data management and rapid application deployment solutions company TigerLogic . The service uses the Yolink search API to help you find context and backlinks within your 'newspaper ' - and uses the jQuery Masonry plugin for links , videos and photos imported from Facebook 's Open Graph API to display your content in traditional broadsheet style . PostPost also only uses JavaScript , so can scale easily and find and display news stories in real time . For now this interesting new Facebook product is still in the beta testing phase . So if you are not keen on the look of Facebook 's own news feeds , then you might want to try out the new service over at PostPost Here 's a video outlining a little more about PostPost : Via CNN.com

Facebook is set to revamp the look of your personal profile page in the very near future . Mark Zuckerberg , speaking on primetime US TV show 60 Minutes over the weekend , explained and previewed the forthcoming design changes to host Lesley Stahl , in what is sure to be seen as a major PR coup for the social network . Profile streamlining The key design concept is to try to integrate in one place – your main profile page – all the information that is currently scattered across your Wall , photo albums and elsewhere on Facebook . Facebook will introduce a new `` bio '' space at the top which gives a quick overview of who you are and what you are up to , along with a more obvious photo section which runs recent images of yourself and those tagged by your mates . New Facebook Profile : your new 'bio ' space will look like this You will also be able to quickly get an overview of your history of your relationship with any particular Facebook friends , a development of a set of features Facebook already launched a couple of months back . `` You can see all the things that you have in common with that person , '' Zuckerberg told Stahl . `` It gives you this amazing connection with that person in a way that the current version of the profile that we have today just does n't do . '' Most users will see the new Facebook design by early 2011 . You can see more details over on the Facebook blog detailing the reasoning behind the design changes . And if you really can not wait till January to see what the new Facebook looks like , you can sign up to change over a little earlier over at www.facebook.com/about/profile/ . Finally , Zuckerberg denied that his company has plans for a Facebook-branded phone , a rumour that has proven to be particularly persistent over the past few months .

Facebook Deals launched in the UK this week , and there are already a number of companies clambering over themselves to offer the best deals for you to check into through Places . The likes of Starbucks , Mazda and even Alton Towers , are offering deals exclusively to those who check into their places of worship through Facebook Places . Interestingly , Facebook has said that it wo n't be getting any money whatsover from the deals that are in place through the new service - although we reckon there will be a knock-on effect for those who currently advertise on the site . For those interested in Facebook Places and the incentives now offered , here 's a list of the first deals to hit the UK from today and throughout the year . Alton Towers is opening its doors 18 February exclusively to anyone who checks in through Facebook Places on that day . You can also tag ( up to ) three friends and they get free entry .

You can get both of these from the official merchandise stand on the London dates of his OMG Tour this week . Not all these deals are serving you with discounts you know ; there 's also a little bit of charidee as well . From today Argos will donate £1 to its national charity partner Teenage Cancer Trust for the first 10,000 customers that check-in at an Argos stores this week . Benetton has also chosen to support a charity . Starting today and throughout February , Benetton will donate £2 for each check-in in select stores in Europe . The charity benefiting from this is Architecture for Humanity , an association which applies design and architecture to social projects .
Facebook has announced the arrival of Facebook Deals in the UK , a new mobile phone discounting system that rewards those who regularly check-in to shops and restaurants , through Facebook Places , in the UK . The location-based application is stepping on the toes of other services in the mobile world , most notably discount site Groupon . There are a number of retail partners who have signed up to offer discounts if you use the service in their shop . The type of deals differ from shop to shop but you can expect 'buy one get one offers ' and the like . Partners include : Starbucks , Yo ! Sus , Argos , Debenhams , O2 and Mazda . There 's some pretty big deals to begin Facebook Places . Mazda is offering five free cars for five months , Starbucks is coughing up free coffees and O2 is giving away PS3s and Xbox 360s to select people at select stores who upgrade their phones this weekend . All discounts will be shown on Facebook Places as a yellow ( golden ) ticket icon . European launch The launch is across Europe , with the UK being the first to launch . Joanna Shields from Facebook said : `` Facebook Deals represents the power of word of mouth marketing and personal recommendation . `` By checking in and taking the deal , this is shown on your news feed so your friends can also see what deals are taking place . `` Borders are fading away and a new global social fabric is appearing in front of our lives . `` Over 200 million people use Facebook on their mobile phone . We are now offering businesses the oppurtunity to connect with people in an entirely new way . '' There are a number of deals you can get through Facebook Deals . These include charity deals , so shops will give money to a charity on your behalf . You will also get discounts and there is also a friends deal system .

Facebook has responded to rumours that it is partnering with HTC on a Facebook-branded handset by smartly denying it . We reported on the rumours yesterday , which indicated that HTC would unveil two high-end handsets made in partnership with the social network . However , Facebook 's head of business development , Dan Rose , told journalists this morning , `` This is really just another example of a manufacturer who has taken our public APIs and integrated them into their device in an interesting way . `` The rumours around there being something more to this HTC device are overblown . '' You 'll be sayin ' no , no , no , no , no Although Rose seems to confirm that HTC is working on a handset that heavily integrates Facebook functionality ( perhaps even the ability to call friends within Facebook ) , when asked if the HTC device would be Facebook branded , he responded emphatically , `` No . '' That seems to be that then . Or is it ? We 're not entirely convinced by Facebook 's denial ; it would n't be the first time a technology company has said one thing and done another , after all . Whatever the truth is , we wo n't be sure of it until Mobile World Congress 2011 , where we 'll be checking each HTC handset carefully for a sneaky Facebook logo . Via Reuters
Following leaked images online that suggested that a Facebook voice calling service is imminent , the social network has invited press to attend an event next Monday at which it is planning to make a 'major announcement ' . Rumours that this might finally be an official announcement relating to a partnership between Skype and Facebook – which we originally reported on back in September 2010 – are flying around . `` Call me on Facebook '' A number of Facebook users have already flagged the fact that there appears to be a new `` call '' button that shows up when viewing other people 's profiles , hence the reason why voice-calling via Facebook seems a likely announcement to expect next week . TechRadar has contacted both Skype and Facebook and been quickly served with 'no comments ' on these rumours . A Facebook spokesperson told us : `` We do n't comment on rumor and speculation and have nothing to announce at this time . '' Either way , something big and potentially interesting is brewing in the Facebook camp , whether or not it turns out to be voice-calls or a Skype partnership ( involving some form of Skype integration into Facebook Chat ) . Will voice-calls be the latest addiction to Zuckerberg 's plans to turn Facebook into a `` modern messaging system '' ? TechRadar will of course be at the announcement next Monday to bring you all the news as it breaks .

Facebook has revealed it is working on a new and rather innovative security measure for the site , which involves the identification of your Facebook friends . Facebook has been looking at ways to add an extra layer of security to your Facebook account Inception-style , which will stop would-be hackers taking over your profile . While security protocols , rather embarrassingly , did n't work this week for a Mark Zuckerberg fan page , Facebook is hoping that 'social authentication ' will bring more security to the site . Knowing who your friends are `` Instead of showing you a traditional Captcha on Facebook , one of the ways we may help verify your identity is through social authentication , '' said Facebook in a blog . `` We will show you a few pictures of your friends and ask you to name the person in those photos . `` Hackers halfway across the world might know your password , but they do n't know who your friends are . '' It 's true that hackers do n't know who your friends are , but do you ? Some people will have procured a number of hangers-on in their friends list , so it will be interesting just how many legitimate people get stuck on trying to name their friends . Social authentication is still in the test stage at the moment , but it could well be the thing to deter hackers from getting to your profile – especially if they do n't like the look of your mate 's ugly mug .
As the CEO of Facebook , you 'd think Mark Zuckerberg 's fan page on the social network would be the safest of all ; but today saw it hacked by parties unknown . The fan page , which has nearly three million 'likes ' , seemingly posted a message calling for Facebook to transform into a 'social business ' . However , it was neither Zuck nor his PR team who posted the status , which was swiftly removed ( but not before over a thousand people 'liked ' it ) . Bad zuck The status update was hashtagged ' # hackercup2011 ' , an annual competition in which hackers compete to solve puzzles for `` fame and glory '' . It looks like one hacker certainly deserves a special commendation for the act , although it 's not really in the spirit of the thing . The hack raises serious questions about Facebook 's security , particularly as we store more and more information about ourselves on the networking site . It comes after recent concerns prompted Facebook to back down over sharing users ' data with advertisers . The password is password While it 's unknown whether the hacker actually did anything more sophisticated than guess the password for Zuckerberg 's fan page , the fact that such a prominent user can be hacked is worrying to all Facebookers . Facebook has declined to comment thus far ; probably busy trying to think up a new password . Via Facebook and TechCrunch

Never one to mince words , Pope Benedict XVI has issued an edict today encouraging young Christians to join social networks like Facebook and Twitter . After extolling the virtues and risks of an online presence , Pope Benedict wrote , `` I would like then to invite Christians , confidently and with an informed and responsible creativity , to join the network of relationships which the digital era has made possible . '' The Vatican 's intention is , of course , that young people use the networks to spread the Gospel , not just for a spot of innocent pre-marriage poking . Distraction Spreading the virtual Word is all well and good , but , like many psychologists before him , the Pope also warns against `` excessive exposure to the virtual world '' and the dangers of creating an online persona . `` It is important always to remember that virtual contact can not and must not take the place of direct human contact , '' he argues . `` Entering cyberspace can be a sign of an authentic search for personal encounters with others , provided that attention is paid to avoiding dangers such as enclosing oneself in a sort of parallel existence , or excessive exposure to the virtual world . '' Digital Pope It 's not the first time the Vatican has got all 21st century on us ; the Pope already has Facebook and iPhone apps , and has welcomed the site 's popularity in past missives . Today 's social networking homily comes on the feast day of Saint Francis de Sales , patron Saint of journalists – a breed that is already well-versed in using social networks to gain
The BBC has ruled out launching its own social network to compete with the likes of Twitter and Facebook . The integration of social networking tools into the iPlayer has been a big success for the BBC , but it has not decided to use its clout to bring a UK rival to the table . `` BBC Online will not launch its own social network , '' stated the BBC as it outlined a raft of cutbacks and changes to its online offering . iPlayer - staying social It was the third iteration of the iPlayer that brought social-networking tools to the service . The use of Facebook and Twitter helped to bring more social integration to the iPlayer - so if your friends 'Like ' something they have watched , it can be recommended for you to view . The company has been asked to severely cut back the money it is spending on online , with some 200 websites set to close or be integrated into other sites by 2013/14 . This has led to the BBC prioritsing just what it should do online - with social-networking being ruled out . Erik Huggers , who recently announced he would be leaving the BBC for Intel , said about the cuts : `` We 're not here to launch our own social network . `` We 're not in trade press business and will not publish local listings . We 're not trying to do a Wikipedia here . We will aggregate well but will refer to other resources on the web . `` When it comes to video on demand , we will link out but will not be providing the technology [ for rival services ] . `` And we will not invest in online sports rights . '' The BBC has long been criticised by other broadcasters and newspapers for treading on their toes in the online sector , so Huggers ' speech today will alleviate some of that animosity - unfortunately , though , hundreds of jobs will be lost in the process .

Facebook has launched a new mobile site for feature phones , with the social networking site now easily available on the vast majority of the world 's mobile phones . 'Feature phones ' ( essentially any phones that are not classified as smartphones ) make up nearly 80 per cent of all mobile phone owners in the US , according to a Nielsen study from last June . While early adopters and tech fans embrace the latest smartphones and apps , it is easy to forget that the vast majority of mobile phone users still do n't use or own smartphones . Millions more on mobile Facebook Facebook 's latest mobile app for the lower-end phone user will now give millions more users quick and easy access to their Facebook messages , events , pictures , news feeds , profiles and the rest . The app gives users a better , almost smartphone-like Facebook experience that includes simple homescreen navigation , contact syncing and fast scrolling of updates and photos . Over on the Facebook blog , the company 's mobile program manager Mark Heynen notes : `` We want people to have a great mobile experience no matter what type of phone they carry . Smartphones have offered better features for sharing with friends but are n't used by most people around the world . The Facebook rep notes that its new mobile website will work on over 2,500 lower-end mobile phones from the likes of Nokia , Samsung and LG . The mobile app is similar in design to the 0.facebook.com site with Facebook listing 14 mobile operators worldwide offering free data access to users trying out the new Facebook mobile app for the first 90 days .

Facebook has decided to not offer its users ' address and mobile number information to developers for now , announcing that it has `` temporarily disabled '' the feature . Facebook revealed at the weekend that it was expanding the amount of information developers could access from your profile , adding addresses and mobile phone numbers to the list . This information was meant to create `` more efficient third-party apps '' for the site , but hit instant backlash from critics who thought that their 'private ' information was being used to their detriment . Online security company Sophos called it a `` recipe for disaster , '' while Facebook told TechRadar that its users have `` absolute control '' over information that is shared on the site . Making changes Facebook , after listening to the mostly negative feedback , has decided to stop third-party developers from accessing your mobile number and address , saying that an improved version of the feature will `` be out in a few weeks '' . `` Over the weekend , we got some useful feedback that we could make people more clearly aware of when they are granting access to this data , '' said Facebook 's Douglas Purdy in a blog post . `` We agree , and we are making changes to help ensure you only share this information when you intend to do so . `` We 'll be working to launch these updates as soon as possible , and will be temporarily disabling this feature until those changes are ready . '' It will be interesting to see just how Facebook broach this obviously thorny privacy issue later in the month .

The second generation of Swiftkey , a popular text-input app for Android , is set to be launched at Mobile World Congress 2011 , and will use your Facebook , Twitter and Gmail accounts to learn how you type . The app offers a different kind of text prediction to T9 , the traditional predictive text , learning your writing style and suggesting phrases that you 're likely to use in context . It has proven very popular with Android users , garnering over 650,000 downloads over the past six months . The new function will see Swiftkey become , er , swifter at learning your style , as well as studying how you make errors based on the way you type . An app that scours your social networking profiles to learn how you think is a slightly scary concept but , on the plus side , it should make texting quicker . Getting in on the tablet action The first licensing deal TouchType has struck will also be announced at Mobile World Congress 2011 , seeing the software come bundled with a series of Android devices in much the same way as the Samsung Galaxy S comes with Swype pre-installed . The company is now working on a tablet edition of Swiftkey , which should be released some time in Q2 . `` Android makes it very easy to port the software across because it 's so open , but because usage inputs are quite different on tablet screens , we 're doing more than simply porting the mobile keyboard over , '' said Reynolds .
Facebook updated its data policy for developers over the weekend , allowing them to use more of your information to build more efficient third party apps for the site . The new information that devs can potentially get their hands on , according to the Facebook developer blog , is your mobile phone number and address . That is if you have put this information into Facebook and you have given them permission to access it . With every Facebook data update comes the inevitable backlash and it was security outfit Sophos who was quick to point out the problems with this . Graham Cluely from Sophos called it a 'recipe for disaster ' , saying : `` This change is n't as drastic as it might first appear , because users will need to give permission for third-party Facebook applications to access this data . `` But it still sounds like a recipe for disaster , given the prevalence of rogue scam applications already on Facebook - all of which benefit from apparently being blessed by the Facebook name and brand . '' Going rogue The idea that 'rogue app developers ' can use your information for malware and the like is n't a new one but it is a worrying one . With this in mind TechRadar contacted Facebook , where a spokesperson promptly told us : `` On Facebook you have absolute control over what information you share , who you share it with and when you want to remove it . `` Developers can now request permission to access a person 's address and mobile phone number to make applications built on Facebook more useful and efficient . '' The spokesperson also noted : `` You need to explicitly choose to share your data before any app or website can access it and no private information is shared without your permission . As an additional step for this new feature , you 're not able to share your friends ' address or mobile information . '' It 's clear Facebook is n't oblivious to the idea that rogue app developers use the site – you only have to check its security pages to see this is the case – but it is asking its users to execute caution when handing over information . The question remains , though : does the everyday Facebook user , who lets apps use their details , understand quite how much information they are giving away on the site – and just how this information is being used ?

Google , Facebook and Yahoo have announced that they will be participating in a 24-hour test of IPv6 on 8 June . By the end of 2011 , it has been forecast that the internet will run out of space using its current 32-bit IPv4 address format . The IPv4 format has been in place for over thirty years , since the very dawn of the web , but the new IPv6 solution will support more web addresses than its predecessor ; a total of 3.4 followed by 38 zeros , to be precise . Hardly room to swing a cat Although some sites , including the Google-owned YouTube , currently use the new standard , IPv6 has never been used on such a wide scale before . Google does n't anticipate many issues though . The illustrious search giant said in a blog post , `` The good news is that Internet users do n't need to do anything special to prepare for World IPv6 Day . Our current measurements suggest that the vast majority ( 99.95 % ) of users will be unaffected . `` However , in rare cases , users may experience connectivity problems , often due to misconfigured or misbehaving home network devices . Over the coming months we will be working with application developers , operating system vendors and network device manufacturers to further minimize the impact and provide testing tools and advice for users .

The Winklevoss twins , the two brothers that claim to have originally come up with the idea for Facebook , are pursuing Mark Zuckerberg in the courts yet again , seemingly unhappy with the $ 65 million payoff already offered . The twins gained mainstream notoriety following the release of The Social Network film late last year . Rancorous litigation Unhappy with the $ 65m settlement offer from Zuckerberg to date ( who wanted an end to the 'rancorous litigation ' ) Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and their partner Divya Narendra are now claiming that Facebook misrepresented its stock price at the time of making the settlement offer , depriving them of millions . Still , today the Winklevoss twins plan to ask the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to undo the $ 65 million settlement previously agreed in order for them to pursue Zuckerberg for yet more money . `` The settlement they reached involved $ 20m in cash and $ 45m in stock based on a valuation of $ 36 a share , '' said lawyer Jerome Falk , representing the Winklevoss twins and Mr Narendra . `` Facebook failed to disclose that at about the same time its board of directors had approved a valuation of $ 9 a share which was to be the basis of stock options for key employees . Facebook did not disclose this significant piece of information . `` This was a highly material fact and the fact they did n't disclose it is a violation of federal security law . '' Mark Zuckerberg was voted Time 's person of the year last month . Via BBC News

At CES in 2008 , Pioneer was one of the most exciting brands at the show . It launched new world-beating 9th-generation Kuro plasma TVs and showcased some staggering PDP tech that 's still to be matched by any of the other big brands three years on . But however much we do n't want to believe it , Kuro is dead . And Pioneer 's press conference at this year 's CES show concentrated solely on in-car mobile products . Some journalists abandoned the queue for the press conference when they heard it was mobile products only , but they missed the launch of some fairly nifty in-car systems . Possibly the most intriguing of Pioneer 's new in-car products are two in-dash car stereos which come with Aha Radio integration . The AVIC-Z130BT and AVIC-X930BT both sport touchscreen interfaces and allow you to keep in touch with your favourite social networking sites while you 're driving your car . Yeah , sounds pretty dangerous to us , too . However , rather than having to read your Twitter or Facebook feeds off the screen , these stereos will actually read them out to you through your car 's stereo system . So now , instead of driving to work listening to [ your favourite feel-good album here ] , you can listen to a robotic Microsoft Sam-style computer voice reading out your mum 's tweets about baking soda and nail polish . The system will also download and play your podcasts and all manner of other social web features , all of which require the use of your phone 's 3G connection . During the press conference , Ted Cardenas , director of marketing for the car electronics division at Pioneer , also announced the new Pioneer SPX-SC101 SmartCradle for use with the Apple iPhone . It 's designed to turn the iPhone into a more usable device for in-car satellite navigation . It 's a lot like a standard sat nav cradle , and is similar to many already released in that it has its own external GPS receiver , a gyroscope and an accelerometer to boost the iPhone 's GPS performance . It includes video and audio-out functionality , which means you should be able to use a compatible in-dash screen instead of the one on your iPhone . Helpful if you 've got a nifty in-dash stereo with a big and sexy display . No , we do n't have one either . And finally , Pioneer also announced the expansion of its in-car Pandora internet radio range of products – there are now twelve Pioneer systems that support the service , although as Pandora is still blocked in the UK , do n't expect to see these features our side of the pond .
Microsoft will stream its traditional CES opening keynote over its Facebook page – allowing people who 'like ' the company to watch Steve Ballmer et al discuss the software giant 's view on forthcoming tech .

To be able to watch the curtain-raiser live , people will have to go over to the official Microsoft Facebook page at http : //www.facebook.com/Microsoft and agree to 'Like ' the company . Stream That will then allow people to watch the streamed event , where the company is expected to show off its latest version of Windows for tablets among other announcements . Steve Ballmer will be leading the keynote – with the ebullient CEO likely to provide his usual energetic commentary on the company 's offerings . Kinect , Windows Phone 7 and Internet Explorer are all likely to get a mention , but it is tablets that are likely to be the headline act for the Redmond giant .

Facebook is now said to be valued at at $ 50 billion ( £32.27 billion ) , following a new round of $ 500 million private investment . Elsewhere , Apple has most recently been valued at $ 300 billion , following a 2 per cent stock surge to kick off the new year . Cash injection The latest cash injection into the world 's biggest online social network comes from Goldman Sachs and Russian investment firm Digital Sky Technologies . Goldman Sachs will invest $ 450 million in Facebook , while DST will invest $ 50 million , according to a New York Times ' source . Both companies plan to raise an addition $ 1 billion in extra funding , according to the source , reportedly close to the deal . `` I do n't think it 's a replacement for a public offering , I just think it 's a mechanism for delaying it , '' opined Jeremy Liew , managing director at venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners . Apple 's latest $ 300 billion valuation follows a massively successful 2010 , marked by the highlights of the launch of the iPhone 4 and the iPad . Apple is set to release the iPad 2 at some point early in 2011 , and is also rumoured to be launching a Verizon iPhone in the US in the near future . Via Reuters and TechCrunch

Facebook has made some significant changes to its Like button , with the addition of a thumbnail and a snippet of information to your Facebook feed every time you click on the icon on a third-party website . These new features were originally consigned to the Share button , which now looks as if it is being phased out by the social network . Facebook 's Like button has spread through the internet like digital knotweed in recent months , proving a popular tool for sharing articles and telling your Facebook friends what web articles you have liked reading . Push the button The Like button was originally offered to web developers alongside Recommended and Share functionality , but it now seems that the Share button is no more . If you want to add it to a website , you are redirected the more visually enticing thumbs-up logo of the Like button . Facebook has had many digital stalwarts praising it for the introduction of the Like button , with Google 's Eric Schmidtsaying back in 2010 : `` It 's a new phenomenon and it 's a good one . '' Which is a bit like Picasso saying he thinks the sketch you did was `` pretty good '' . Facebook has n't confirmed that its Like button is replacing the rest of its share functionality , but if it is then this could cause problems for sharing articles of interest that contain information that you do n't necessarily like - for example , a well-written piece about the on-going problems in Libya . If this is the case , then the Like button would get the thumbs down from many users . Via Cnet
Odeon has announced that it has become the first cinema chain in the UK to offer up deals through Facebook Places . There are a number of companies who have signed up to Facebook 's Places Deals , which gives consumers discounts if they 'check-in ' to various establishments . On board at the moment are the likes of Starbucks , Argos , Debenhams , O2 , Alton Towers , and Mazda . While the numerous discounts could eventually lead to customer loyalty , Odeon 's first Places Deals offer is n't exactly enticing . Film focus If you check-in through Facebook Places , then a small bag of popcorn could be yours for free . And we stress the word 'could ' , as the offer is finite , running for a month at selected Odeon 's or until the allocated 1,000 popcorn boxes run out . It 's great that Odeon is on board for Places Deals , but until the offers start to resemble something like the hugely successful 'buy one get one free ' Orange Wednesdays ticket promotion , they 're more Razzie than Oscar worthy . Then again , you do get a choice between salted or sweet .

Facebook has announced that it has simplified its current 5,830-word privacy policy to make it clearer and easier for users to understand . While non of the terms of the privacy policy have changed , a new format is being trialled to see if it helps users of the site understand how their data is being used . Facebook has been often criticised for making its privacy policy far too convoluted , meaning that you would have to be a brave person to read the thousands of words on the site regarding privacy . Privacy principles Facebook has come up with three basic principles about the policy . If you want to take a look at the new-look , less wordy and not-as-scary privacy policy , then you can do so by going to www.facebook.com/about/privacy .

A new Facebook web app will send you an email to let you know when your friends ' relationship statuses change . If you allow the Breakup Notifier to link up with your account you can select the Facebook friends you 'd like to monitor and then receive an email notification when their love life takes a turn . So , for example , if you 're friends with an old school sweetheart who 's got married to the guy who stole her from you , you can have Breakup Notifier follow her in the hope that it all goes south . `` You like someone . They 're in a relationship . Be the first to know when they 're out of it , '' says the app 's website . Many of us have probably been there , but it 's still pretty creepy . Unofficial While , to our knowledge , the app is n't endorsed by Facebook , the site has n't exactly discouraged the voyeuristic folks among us in the past . So if you 're living hope that `` In a relationship '' is going to become `` it 's complicated '' then there 's now a tool that 'll do it for you without you having to manually check every day ... or every hour .

Facebook has announced that it has expanded its relationship status offering , which allows gay and lesbian couples to acknowledge their relationships online . The social network has added 'in a civil union ' and 'in a domestic partnership ' to its Relationship Status list for users in the UK , US , Canada , Australia and France . Clear message The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation is obviously happy with the news and has said about the news : `` Today , Facebook sent a clear message in support of gay and lesbian couples to users across the globe . `` By acknowledging the relationships of countless loving and committed same-sex couples in the US and abroad , Facebook has set a new standard of inclusion for social media . As public support for marriage equality continues to grow , we will continue to work for the day when all couples have the opportunity to marry and have their relationship recognised by their community , both online and off . '' Now all we need is for Facebook to allow us to add the name of someone we are in a relationship with that has n't got a Facebook account and everybody will be happy .

HTC has told TechRadar that it may roll out the Facebook integration from its recently unveiled HTC ChaCha and Salsa to other devices . Jon French , executive director of HTC UK , Ireland and South Africa , said that HTC had worked on making the Facebook integration as simple as possible and the same features could be brought to more devices in the future : `` It 's no secret that we do n't mind developers plugging into our Sense UI in the same way we worked with Facebook on [ the ChaCha and Salsa ] - it would be a relatively easy thing to take a third-party application and make sure it 's integrated well into Sense . '' Different directions `` We could have implemented what we did on those devices on higher-end smartphones , but we 're trying to target a different demographic ; those that pick up their smartphone even before out of bed . `` However , there 's nothing to say we wo n't expand that offering into different areas of our portfolio going forward - or even expand it to offer different services . '' While French refused to be drawn on which services that could be , the offer is clearly open for another big name to come in and make the same impression - could the Spotify phone be up next ?

Mark Zuckerberg has shed a little more light on the Facebook mobile strategy by promising a slew of new phones with deep Facebook integration . Speaking on video at the HTC press conference to announce the HTC ChaCha and HTC Salsa , Zuckerberg said that this was the first step of many in the industry : `` [ For the ChaCha and Salsa ] HTC took the initiative ; a lot has been made about a single Facebook phone , but you can expect dozens of phones with deeper integration than ever before . '' Making social a success `` In other arenas like gaming , the ones that make the successful products are the ones that just jump right in and think about making social integration a success . `` We 're happy with the direction HTC has taken , and look forward to a lot more to come . '' This was a sentiment echoed by Chamath Palihapitiya , VP of growth for Mobile at Facebook when he took to the stage at the press conference : `` This is the first step - the first of many things to come between HTC and us . '' The HTC ChaCha and HTC Salsa are n't the only 'Facebook phones ' this year - INQ has also come out with the INQ Cloud Touch and Cloud Q , which feature a different kind of deep Facebook integration , so it looks this is going to be a trend at the lower end of the cost scale .
HTC has finally announced the oft-rumoured 'Facebook phones ' in th shape of the HTC Salsa and HTC ChaCha . Although not branded by Facebook , the two companies worked closely together to create the final products , and come complete with a branded Facebook key . The HTC ChaCha , ridiculous moniker aside , is a QWERTY portrait device with a 2.6-inch capacitive touchscreen with HVGA ( 480x320 ) resolution stuffed in . A 'unique tilt design makes it easier to hold in the hand , and comes complete with a VGA front facing camera as well as a 5MP one on the rear too with LED flash . The same but different The HTC Salsa is relatively similar , although does away with QWERTY keyboard in favour of a 3.4-inch screen , with the same HVGA resolution and 5MP camera and LED flash . Both phones come with a slightly disappointing 600MHz Qualcomm processor on board , meaning they 're likely to be tipped more towards the budget end of the market . But more exciting is the Facebook key , a front button that will glow gently to let you know when content can be uploaded or shared , as well as allow instant access to the Facebook portal or update your status . Both handsets will be shipping with the latest version of Android ( Gingerbread ) and the HTC ChaCha and HTC Salsa have been given UK release dates for early-to-mid Q2 2011 .

Facebook has announced upgrades to its Facebook Pages including a redesign in line with the recent profile update . Facebook Pages can now display recent photos along the top of the page , as well as allowing admins to highlight who is running the Page . Meanwhile , tabs have been moved to a column under the Page profile picture . One nifty new move is to allow Pages to post comments and 'like ' other Pages as their own Page , rather than as the person managing the page . That 's confusing For example , TechRadar could now comment on another company 's Facebook Page as TechRadar ; this was n't previously possible . Other improvements include the filtering technology on the Page Wall , which will display the most interesting posts first ( presumably based on number of comments and 'likes ' ) . Developers may also be pleased to hear that the Pages now support iframe based tabs for more design flexibility , while Page owners may enjoy opting to receive email notifications when people post comments on the Page . Within four weeks , the new format will be rolled out to all Pages on Facebook ; personal profiles wo n't be affected .

Twitter is being earmarked for a takeover by two of the biggest technology companies in the world – Facebook and Google . This is according to the Wall Street Journal , who believes that the micro-blogging is now worth an estimated $ 10 billion . Twitter has continuously denied that it is being sold , or becoming a public company , but now that two tech heavyweights are in proposed talks with the company ( their names have been bandied around before ) this may all be set to change . TwitterBook or Twoogle ? Twitter under either Google or Facebook 's control will be a wholly different beast . Facebook has been constantly updating itself to add more real-time elements into its friend 's stream , while Google already has Twitter updates in its search functionality . Currently Twitter has around 175 million registered accounts – which is small fry compared to 600 million active users Facebook has currently got . In other Twitter news , venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz has bought up an $ 80 million stake in Twitter . This means that the firm is the first in the world to have a stake in Facebook , Groupon , Zynga and Twitter – four of the biggest social media companies in the world .

Gaming megalith Electonic Arts has told investors that it will focus much more heavily on Facebook as a platform for its games in 2011 . The rise and rise of the likes of FarmVille and Bejewelled have given EA pause for thought , and Develop reports that the company 's third quarter results came with an insistence that new focus on social networks was key . `` Last year we saw a drop off in games related to changes on the Facebook platform , but we are encouraged by the recent turnaround , '' said COO John Schappert . Increase in traffic `` We 're seeing an increase in game traffic on Facebook and believe the site has stabilised , with a current estimate of 290 million gamers playing an average of 3.5 hours per month , '' he added `` Our leadership on mobile and smart phones taught us a great deal about how these new platforms evolve . `` We know that consumers are attracted to new experiences , but quickly aggregate behind high quality and the brands and franchises they recognize from other media . `` In 2011 , you 'll see more of EA 's big franchises come to Facebook as well new , original offerings . '' EA bought Playfish for this very reason in 2009 , and the company has invested heavily in looking beyond the traditional mainstays of gaming , like consoles and the PC .

British Facebooker Ashley Mitchell has pleaded guilty to stealing over 400 billion poker chips on Facebook . The £7.4m-worth of chips were pinched by posing as an administrator on the Zynga game , which allowed Mitchell to log in and steal the chips . He then laundered the swag using a number of other Facebook accounts and sold a number of the chips on before he was caught . App security Although the Zynga theft took place in 2009 , it does n't exactly fill us with confidence about the security of Facebook apps and games , especially as games like FarmVille are dealing in millions of dollars . Facebook has recently had to contend with numerous privacy concerns and the fan page of its CEO , Mark Zuckerberg , was hacked just weeks ago . Via BBC
Facebook has announced it is bringing its redesigned photo viewer to the UK , which updates one of the most laborious aspects of the site . The Facebook Photo Viewer Product , to give it its proper name , is a complete overhaul of the social-network 's photo service . It allows users to open images inside the Facebook browser without opening a new page , accommodates large photo sizes and re-sizes the photo relative to the size of the browser window . In short , Facebook has created a rival to Flickr but with a much larger user base . Photo finish The new update will also bring faster photo uploads and you will be able to Like , tag and comment within the photo viewer . It 's taken Facebook a good few months to sort out its new-fangled photo service for the UK . The site originally announced the image improvements way back in October . The update will be rolled out to the UK gradually , so do n't worry if you are still having to deal with the frankly pants photo viewer of yore .
Microsoft 's tie up with Facebook has apparently been a roaring success , with the company claiming that 2.8 billion minutes of Facebook Chat is now coming through Messenger , and 75 million more customers are now able to take advantage of the service . Microsoft had announced the 1.5 billion minute landmark back in November , after launching the service in August 2010 , but the collaboration has continued to grow and is now closing in on 3 billion minutes a month . The service has now been rolled out to more messenger clients – 75 million of them to be precise – and should now be available 'wherever Facebook is available ' . 75 per cent `` The number of Messenger customers who have connected Messenger to Facebook has grown over 75 % to nearly 18 million people , '' blogged Microsoft 's Piero Sierra . `` The addition of these new connections has nearly doubled the number of chat sessions between Messenger and Facebook to about 440 million , powering more than 2.8 billion minutes of Facebook chat . `` We expect even more progress with the availability of Facebook chat from Messenger to the remaining countries we 're releasing this feature to today . '' YouTube , LinkedIn , MySpace Other Live services tie-ups from Microsoft – as it embraces the open world – include YouTube , LinkedIn and MySpace . `` We 've been working to build partnerships with Messenger that help customers connect to their friends across their different social networks , added Sierra . `` The number of connections Messenger customers are making to LinkedIn has more than doubled since our last update . Meanwhile , MySpace and YouTube connections have grown nearly 50 per cent to remain among the top services among more than 75 great services that customers are connecting to Windows Live . ''
Facebook games like FarmVille could be taking more cash than most traditional console games if estimations by gaming site IGN are to be believed . The site slotted Facebook games like FarmVille into the top 10 games of 2010 , taking both number of players and estimated money made into account . Although Call of Duty : Black Ops retains its top spot , four Facebook games stormed the list , with CityVille and FarmVille taking the second and third spots , beating big hitters like Halo Reach and Red Dead Redemption quite comfortably . Zynga 's 'Ville franchise , the bane of our news feeds , has things quite nicely sewn up with FrontierVille also featuring in the top 10 . An element of guestimation The numbers are slightly guestimated , based on research findings that 10 per cent of people who play Facebook games pay real money for in-game purchases , and that the average player who makes in-game purchases spends around $ 55 ( £34 ) . Even so , the chart gives a good idea of how social gaming is raking in the cash and its small , repeated purchases are proving more lucrative than traditional high-box-price games .

Manchester United have explained how they use Facebook to expand their fanbase and bring more money into the club . The Premiership club has one of the strongest brands in world football , and uses Facebook because it aligns with the same demographic as its fans across the world . Richard Arnold , the club 's commercial director explained in a video : `` Using the social plug-ins on the homepage of Manchester United has been incredibly important . `` They allow us to immediately communicate to the fans and receive feedback on what they like , what they do n't like and how that translates into future activities for us . '' Bandwagon The club is certainly not alone , with major brands leaping aboard the social networking bandwagon . Facebook is currently battling for supremacy on the web with search giant Google , with the site 's massive global audience an incredibly attractive proposition . The arrival of the 'Like ' button means that fans of a brand , or in this case a football club , can be the most targeted of audiences . And we 'll all probably accept marketing when it comes from a brand we have gone out of our way to express out online admiration for .
Google has announced the arrival of its Facebook Like button rival – Google +1 . In Google 's own words , the button is shorthand for `` this is pretty cool '' . This essentially means that you can recommend a web page or an advert to your friends , so they do n't have to go searching for it themselves . The feature is on a slow rollout at the moment and you have to have a Google Profile for it to work , but the idea is that any of your Google contacts will start to see things you have recommended when they search . Social searching `` Like social search , we use many signals to identify the most useful recommendations , including things like the people you are already connected to through Google ( your chat buddies and contacts , for example ) , '' said Rob Spiro , Product Manager , at Google in a blog post . `` Soon we may also incorporate other signals , such as your connections on sites like Twitter , to ensure your recommendations are as relevant as possible . If you want to know who you 're connected to , and how , visit the 'Social Circle and Content ' section of the Google Dashboard . '' At the moment you can +1 sites through the Google search but Google is hoping to eventually add a +1 button to websites . Which is just like what Facebook has done with Like . As always Google has made a twee video to explain to the Everyman what Google +1 is about . Warning : may be too cute and cuddly for most hardened tech cynics to handle .

Facebook is mining information from users ' real-time conversations and updates in a test to improve its results from targeted advertising campaigns . The new advertising delivery method is currently being tested on 1 per cent of Facebook users worldwide , which equates to around 6 million people . No Facebook Chat mining `` We are currently testing a feature that simply helps surface relevant advertising more quickly , '' a Facebook spokesperson told TechRadar earlier today , reassuring us that the data that will be mined for targeted ads will not be taken from Facebook Chat conversations , but only from your Facebook Profile status updates . This means that , essentially , anything you add in your status update could well , at some point in the near future , be used to direct targeted advertising your way via your Facebook home page . Facebook has been using information from status updates and wall posts to deliver advertising to users for a while now , but this latest test is the first time it will be delivering targeted ads to users in real-time . The appeal to advertisers is clear , with Facebook offering the opportunity to talk directly to potential customers at the point at which they express a desire to buy a particular product or service , whether that be a take-out pizza from Dominos or a new car from Volkswagen . `` The long-held promise of local is to deliver timely , relevant and measurable ads which drive actions such as commerce , so if Facebook is moving in this direction , it 's brilliant , '' Reggie Bradford , CEO of Facebook software and marketing company Vitrue told AdAge.com . `` This is a massive market shift everyone is pivoting toward , led by services such as Groupon . Facebook has the power of the graph of me and my friends placing them in the position to dominate this medium . '' Facebook has yet to reveal any further plans for its long-term real-time marketing strategy , with the current tests said to be going on indefinitely . Via AdAge.com

Facebook has a deal in place to acquire Snaptu , a company that creates Java-based apps for feature phones . The London-based company was founded in 2007 and is already responsible for the feature-rich Facebook application for non-smartphones . The acquisition , which is set to close within a few weeks , has reportedly netted that Snaptu founders $ 60- $ 70m . Snaptu it The deal means we 're likely to see better Facebook applications with more functionality for feature , phones which do n't have the benefit of super-sized screens or mega processing power . Snaptu explained its position on its blog today : `` We soon decided that working as part of the Facebook team offered the best opportunity to keep accelerating the pace of our product development . And joining Facebook means we can make an even bigger impact on the world . '' Facebook , meanwhile , confirmed that it will be improving its feature phone offerings in a statement : `` As part of Facebook , Snaptu 's team and technology will enable us to deliver an even better mobile experience on feature phones more quickly .

4Chan founder Christopher Poole ( Moot ) has had his say on Facebook 's commenting system that is doing the rounds on a variety of websites , and it 's fair to say he 's not happy that you have to use your real name . The online community of 4Chan feeds on being anonymous , something that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said had `` a lack of integrity '' . In a panel at SXSW Poole hit back , saying : `` Zuckerberg 's totally wrong on anonymity being total cowardice . Anonymity is authenticity . `` It allows you to share in a completely unvarnished , raw way . '' Mass collaboration Unvarnished and raw is definitely one way to describe 4Chan 's message boards , but Poole was also keen to point out that 4Chan 's image in the media has been `` misunderstood '' and that the site stuffed with creativity . `` People want to think everyone on 4Chan is a young rambunctious male . That 's not accurate – it 's a wide range of people using it . `` One of the things that 4Chan does that 's really special is the way people come together to collaborate en masse . It 's the process at which you arrive at the product that is fascinating . '' Via the Guardian

TechRadar met up with a number of Facebook engineers today , who explained the changes that were happening with the site in terms of implementing HTML 5 and how they work with the daily challenges of keeping the site upright . One of the things mentioned was how the company works to curtail DDoS attacks , which according to Facebook happen very rarely . `` As far as I know , we have only had one or two DDoS attacks on the site , '' explained David Recordon , senior open programmes manager , at Facebook . `` You would need a pretty big botnet to attack us and I do n't think they would want to put all their effort into downing the site and expose their ways . `` When we have site blips people think we are having an attack – it 's not , it is usually us screwing up but it 's fixed within an hour . '' Facebook attack To keep Facebook and its API free from attack , the site does have a number of teams in place that monitor the site for security flaws and try and fix them ad hoc . Recordon explained that there is a `` site integrity team '' in place whose sole job it is to check the site for imperfections and there are other techniques being used . `` We use a combination of technology and the systems that we have built from scratch , '' said Recordon . Simon Cross , the first UK-based Facebook platform engineer , told to TechRadar that there are other security measures in place , one of which is protecting its Like button functionality from click jackers . `` We have click-jacking prevention techniques that we do n't talk about and we try and stop it within our code , but we also speak to browser vendors , '' said Cross . `` Click-jacking is a very clever hack that people are doing . There is an on-going dialogue across the whole industry to prevent this , though . '' Security response Jason Sobel , engineering manager at Facebook , explained to TechRadar that there were internal security procedures in place if the site is compromised , but there is also a reliance from external sources to let them know what is going on . `` We have a number of levels of security response , '' explained Sobel . `` We have a security incident team , and we get reports from white hat hackers who are trying to help us out which is great . `` We have other security glitches that are n't reported to us directly but we try and fix them within hours of them happening . `` We also have a team of internal white hats who find security holes before they are made public and this again is a massive help . '' Code red Interestingly , problems with Facebook that come from the site 's code are ultimately down to the person who created it . So an engineer , no matter how low down the chain he is , could expect a midnight call if things on the site go awry and it is their code that is causing the problems . `` There are 24/7 engineers who watch all the monitoring data we have and make sure that if there is something that crashes or there are unusual trends on the site , we can fix them , '' said Sobel . `` If they do n't know how to fix it , then we have app operations who know how to solve a vast number of problems . But the last resort is that we phone the engineer who created the code in the middle of the night to sort it . '' Cross , who recently came back from a Facebook boot camp where he created some code for the site 's photo section , explained a bit more about the situation . `` The developer has ultimate responsibility for the code , from its inception up until it is superseded . `` So it is scary if you are that developer , but what that makes you do is write code in the right way . `` It is all about relationship and accountability .

Facebook is set to introduce a new 'social reporting ' feature , which will allow users to report offensive content to trusted friends , parents or teachers . Rather than going through the virtual process of reporting abuse to Facebook alone , the network is hoping that a real-word authority figure will be able to deal with the issue more directly . Facebook says that the new feature is intended to `` promote a culture of respect on Facebook '' and will demonstrate to bullies that online behaviour has real world consequences . Inspired by the White House These `` trusted friends '' do n't have to be members of Facebook themselves , as the user can report the image or status to them using an external email address . The social reporting system is part of Facebook 's new and improved safety centre , which should help users find the information they need quickly and more easily using interactive features and videos . Facebook 's move is inspired by the White House Conference on Bullying Prevention which kicks off today , and the new features will be rolled out over the coming weeks .
The annual Forbes rich list is out and it seems that those associated with Facebook 's early days are now reaping vast amounts of monetary reward , with six people associated with Facebook on the list . At the top of the coffers pile is co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg . He has yet to break into the top 50 of the world 's richest people - but at number 52 he 's not short of a few bob or two . Forbes has calculated his wealth to be around $ 13.5 billion , or £8.3 billion . To put this in context , this is a similar wealth to Paul Allen , co-founder of Microsoft , who has $ 13 billion stashed under his mattress . Money makers The other folk to get mega-rich from Facebook are : co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Eduardo Saverin , and investors Sean Parker and Peter Thiel . To show how the tide is changing in the technology world , however , perhaps the biggest star on the list is Yuri Milner . He is not only an investor in Facebook but CEO of Digital Sky Technologies who also owns a large whack of Zynga , the social gaming developer behind FarmVille . He may not be as well known as Zuckerberg but he was chosen as the cover star of the rich list this year .

As the great online content delivery scramble continues , Warner Brothers has decided to try renting its movies using Facebook . It 's a service that 's pretty limited for the moment ; only those in the US who 'liked ' The Dark Knight can currently rent Christopher Nolan 's Batman flick for $ 3 . Warner Bros. says it will make further films available as time marches on , but there 's no word on when , if at all , we 'll see the service make its way to the UK . I believe in Harvey Dent Digital distribution has proven quite the hurdle for Hollywood , and studios are somewhat on the back foot to web-savvy pirates . Other popular approaches include YouTube 's possible film streaming service , Amazon 's recent LoveFilm acquisition and all the 'watch now ' opportunities it offers , while all the major studios continue to rail against online piracy . Warners has also recently launched 'app editions ' of Christopher Nolan 's The Dark Knight and Inception , whereby users can simply buy the movie via the app .

Facebook has teamed-up with UK charity Samaritans to allow users of the site to report friends they fear may be contemplating suicide . The new scheme asks Facebookers to fill in a form , detailing worrying posts and status updates that will then be dealt with as a highest priority by Facebook 's operations team . They will then decide whether to call the police or to pass the information onto Samaritans . Users will also have the option of contacting Samaritans directly through phone numbers on Facebook 's help page . Raising the alarm The initiative follows reports that an increasing number of people have used the social networking portal in order to announce their intentions to end their own lives . On Christmas Day Simone Black , 42 , informed over 1,000 friends that she had taken an overdose , but it was n't until the next day that anyone raised the alarm to the authorities . By then it was too late . Harness the power Samaritans chief executive Catherine Johnstone says that the aim of the scheme is to harness the power of 30m UK Facebook users to ensure this does n't happen again . She says : `` Through the popularity of Facebook , we are harnessing the power of friendship so people can get help . `` As a friend you are better placed to know whether someone close to you is struggling to cope or even feeling suicidal . `` We want to remind people that if a friend says that life is n't worth living , they should always be taken seriously . `` Facebook is a part of daily life for so many of us and we must make sure that people online have support when they need it . '' Check out the Samaritans ' Facebook page for more info
Facebook and Skype are reportedly back in talks about offering web-based video calling . The two companies originally began talks on the subject last year , but these seemingly came to nothing further than Facebook integration in Skype . According to Bloomberg , two sources 'familiar with the discussions ' have confirmed that video-calling talks are back on . Ugh , video calling While some of us rue the day Apple decided to put its magical marketing might behind video-calling with its FaceTime app , many people see it as the next big thing and a Facebook/Skype tie-in would see the social network 's 500 million users able to video call each other to their hearts ' content . Facebook released the following statement regarding the rumours : `` Last year , we announced the integration of Facebook in Skype , so people can keep up to date with their Facebook friends through News Feed in Skype and even call and SMS their Facebook friends on any phone from Skype . `` With regards to any further integration , we do n't comment on rumor and speculation and have nothing to announce at this time .

With over 500 million users , Facebook is by far the world 's biggest social networking site - and has also been making important contributions to the open source community . David Recordon , the site 's head of open source , talks us through the company 's approach to free software . LXF : What 's your background in open source ? David Recordon : I really got started working with open source when I was a teenager . I was using YaBB SE ( PHP forum software ) , and started helping others within the community . At the time , I knew C++ and a bit of Perl , but really had n't done much web programming . PHP was easy to pick up and I loved the immediacy of being able to just hit save and then refresh my browser . Over the next few years , I got more deeply involved in the project , helped launch the rewrite as Simple Machines Forum , and built a forum-hosting business with my friend Joshua Dickerson . I guess this was really my first experience of being deeply involved in an open source project . LXF : Did you continue working in the web business ? DR : A few years later , I interned at LiveJournal , really learned Perl , and was told to never admit that I used Nano ( after switching to Emacs ) . Working at LiveJournal was also my first experience of using Linux on the desktop daily . LXF : You 're well known in the OpenID world . How did you get involved in the project ? DR : A number of people took advantage of the fact that LiveJournal 's core was open source and ran clones . According to Wikipedia , there have been 30 different sites , with DeadJournal being the first in 2001 . While spam was never a major problem within LiveJournal.com , commenting across blogging sites was still riddled with it , because there was no shared notion of identity . OpenID was originally created at Six Apart to help tackle cross-site commenting in a decentralised manner . It 's obviously evolved quite drastically since 2005 , and I really got deeply involved in OpenID 2.0 while I was at VeriSign . It 's been implemented by just about every major web company , but we still have a long way to go . I see the next version of OpenID being built on top of OAuth 2.0 . This will allow it to be a fairly small piece of technology that should work for applications outside of the browser . LXF : How did you make the move to Facebook ? DR : I joined Facebook in 2009 to work on open source and standards . My team is focused on making it easy for anyone in the company to do a really great job of using , contributing to and releasing open source projects . At times this means embedding ourselves within other engineering teams , such as with HipHop for PHP , which we released in early 2010 . While HipHop had proven itself within Facebook , there was a lot of work still to do to make it a useful piece of infrastructure for others . LXF : What exactly does HipHop do ? DR : HipHop really embodies how we create at Facebook . It started as a hackathon project by Haiping Zhao , who was later joined by Iain Proctor and Minghui Yang . Haiping noticed a number of similarities between the syntax of PHP and C++ , and wondered if you could programmatically rewrite one into another . Two-and-half years and a few other engineers later , HipHop was serving the vast majority of Facebook 's production traffic . It takes our PHP source code , transforms it into C++ , and compiles it into a self-contained binary that we deploy on production web servers . This is a typical pattern of how projects get started at Facebook . One or two people just decide to try something . We refer to this as our `` hacker culture '' .

As well as the news that Facebook is used by half the UK population , Facebook also laid bare its vision for the future of the social web in a keynote at the UK 's largest digital marketing event , TFM & A . Stephen Haines , commercial director for Facebook in the UK , said that the site would continue to evolve . `` There have been eight iterations of the [ main ] Facebook design over the last few years ... [ and ] it will look different in a year '' he said , clearly intimating that the site would continue to change to enhance its commercial succcess . The site has never been slow to change fundamentals of its design and approach , most recently with the redesign of the Like button . `` The average Facebook user has 130 friends [ and ] the average time spent on Facebook is 28 minutes a day . '' Haines also showed impressive figures showing the effectiveness of brand pages . The official Starbucks page on Facebook boasts 21.1 million users compared to 1.8m website visitors . Coke 's page is even more extreme – 20.5m users compared to 270,000 website visitors a month . He hailed the success of Facebook Deals , which had even crashed the Alton Towers website . Then Haines talked up the value of social advertising . `` There 's a 68 per cent increase in recall when an ad has a social context , '' said Haines . Ads with a poll are currently some of the most popular , he suggested . Haines also suggested the social network could look to keep users within its walls by offering branded stores for buying goods online . He also talked about the idea of `` social by design '' , saying that GM was now even introducing Facebook streams within some of its car models . And Facebook also seems to be on the rise for display advertising . According to eMarketer research , the social network 's share of ads will rise to nearly 22.6 per cent of its total revenue . From browsing to discovery Haines also surprised the audience by saying that `` the fastest growing Facebook audience is the over-35s '' . However , we guess it 's not so surprising when you consider that practically everybody younger than that has an account . Haines also explained that there are now more over 40s than 13 to 18 year olds on Facebook and talked up the opportunities for marketers within this demographic . A slide was shown , which Haines explained as the fact `` the web is now organising around people and their connections '' . He explained this by showing the 90s as a `` browsing '' period , the 00s as the `` searching '' period and the current decade as a time to `` discover '' . Messages boost ? In a busy day for the social network , Facebook has also announced the purchase of private group messaging startup Beluga – it 's a bit like Google Wave in that it 's effectively private messaging inside a selected group . Indeed , the founders of Beluga previously worked at the Big G. Beluga could be incorporated inside Facebook Messages . The web is also rife with speculation that Facebook is pushing ahead with its controversial plan to allow developers access to users ' personal information if permitted , such as their phone numbers . The plan was originally dropped after an outcry , but now appears to be back on the cards . Facebook now has 30 million UK users and boasts more than 500 million users worldwide . What 's perhaps most impressive is the site 's stickiness . Over 15 million of Facebook 's UK users visit every single day . Amusingly , Haines confessed that he did n't use Facebook four years ago when he was interviewed for his current post .
Facebook group chats should soon be arriving , following a deal which sees Facebook acquiring group chat specialists Beluga this month . Is this the start of Facebook moving into the real-time group chat market currently owned by Twitter ? Or might it be more about slightly more 'closed ' group-chats between groups of close friends ? Chat pods on Facebooks With Beluga 's track record , it would seem to be more likely to be the latter , as the company provides closed group messaging areas in which users can create virtual 'pods ' in which they then invite known friends to join them for a group chat . `` We are happy to announce that Facebook has acquired Beluga ! '' write founders Ben , Lucy and Jon at Team Beluga on the company 's website . `` Since launching Beluga , we 've appreciated all the enthusiasm and positive feedback from our users . We 're excited to continue to build our vision for mobile group messaging as part of the Facebook team . Beluga and Facebook are committed to create new and better ways to communicate and share group experiences . `` For now , Beluga will continue to function as it does today . Your Beluga account and data will not be lost . We 'll be providing more details on future plans for Beluga in the coming weeks . Stay tuned ! '' All three founders have previously worked at Google and will no doubt add a great deal of knowledge and experience to the Facebook team . We expect to hear more on Facebook 's latest plans for group chat features from next week 's South by Southwest Interactive Festival . Beluga already has iPhone and Android apps to communicate with pods of people via traditional text message functions on your smartphone . Via Beluga

Facebook has unveiled it has refreshed its commenting plug-in that allows Facebook users to comment on websites using their own names . There are a number of sites already using the Facebook plug-in , including TechCrunch , and it seems that you can now publish the comments you make on articles to your own Facebook feed , allowing your friends to view what you think about particular stories . Comments , please It 's an interesting concept that completely opens up the idea of story commenting – something that is usually done through a pseudonym . Like most commenting systems , a publisher who uses the plug-in can censor certain comments made , including the blacklisting of words and users . To add the commenting system to a site you will only need a line of code and the ranking of comments will be done through how many Likes a comment gets . This is not the first major change Facebook has made to its API this week . It also changed its Like button , making it more like the site 's Share feature .

Facebook is rolling out a brand new Deals feature through which users can enjoy bargain offers from local businesses via the online Facebook site . Initially rolling out in five US cities , the feature differs from the existing Facebook Deals feature , although we can see why you 'd get confused what with them having the same name and all . The Deals feature which was launched in the UK in January 2011 makes use of Facebook Places to offer location-based deals to mobile Facebook users but the new Facebook Deals is more in line with sites like Groupon and Wahanda , in that online offers are targeted to your local area . Delicious discounts Things like restaurants , sporting events and cinema tickets will be offered at a discounted rate , and users can then redeem them at the venue at a later date . Deals will be offered by email as well as in Facebook news feeds and , of course , come with buttons making them easily shareable with all your Facebook friends . Although you 'll be able to buy deals using a credit card , it 's also another way for Facebook to put its internal currency , 'Facebook Credits ' , to good use , although the company refuses to say how much revenue it will take from each deal . The first five cities to get the deals are San Francisco , Austin , Dallas , Atlanta and San Diego ; who knows when and what areas of the UK will follow suit .

As one Facebook lawsuit draws to a close , another re-rears its ugly head . You may recall Paul Ceglia 's story – he of the ' I bought an 84 per cent stake in Facebook in 2004 and now I want my billions of dollars ' 2010 lawsuit fame . Zuckerberg 's lawyers will be seeing yet more dollar signs as Ceglia , whose 2010 lawsuit was dismissed , has re-filed his motion with some badass new lawyers and a heap of new evidence . While some question why it took so long for this 'new evidence ' to come to light – it 's been almost 10 years , after all – that does n't change the fact that , if genuine , Marky-Zee could have quite a problem on his hands . Email trail More than a dozen emails between Zuckerberg and Ceglia have been submitted as evidence , in which the two men discuss `` the face book '' in detail . This detail includes details of how Ceglia has funded the project , discussion of a contract to be signed by both parties , mention of two other students pursuing a similar project and the launch of the original site . The emails then take a turn – Zuckerberg tells Ceglia that the site is not doing well and that he 's thinking of shutting it down , finally offering to return the $ 2,000 investment which Ceglia says he made in return for a 50 per cent stake . Facebook says these newly discovered emails are fake , just like they said the contract which Ceglia produced for last year 's lawsuit was a fraud too . Fake bake But Ceglia 's new lawyers are more convinced , having told BusinessInsider that they performed `` weeks '' of due diligence in order to verify the validity of the Ceglia 's claims and evidence . But if the evidence is found to be genuine by forensic analysis of the emails , contract and computer hard drives , Ceglia 's bank account could be about to receive a healthy cash injection . And Hollywood is no doubt already salivating at the thought of The Social Network 2 : Ceglia 's Revenge .

A set of twins who claim Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook ca n't back out of a legal settlement after their case was reviewed by an appeals court . Casey and Tyler Winklevoss were awarded a court settlement in 2008 , now worth $ 160m , but have continued to battle , arguing they should have received more Facebook shares as part of the deal . Now an appeals court judge has ruled that the litigation must come to an end , and Facebook wo n't be held further accountable to the twins and fellow claimant Divya Narendra . The three started the ConnectU website while at Harvard and have always maintained that Mark Zuckerberg ripped-off the idea when starting Facebook . The company has always denied these claims . Bested Chief Judge Alex Kozinski , writing for the three-judge panel , said : `` The Winklevosses are not the first parties bested by a competitor who then seek to gain through litigation what they were unable to achieve in the marketplace . `` And the courts might have obliged , had the Winklevosses not settled their dispute and signed a release of all claims against Facebook . `` At some point , litigation must come to an end . That point has now been reached . '' Facebook has expressed pleasure at the verdict through lawyers , while representatives of the twins have yet to comment on the verdict which ends their chances of squeezing more out of the settlement .

Facebook has announced that it has created one of the world 's most efficient data centres and plans to share the technology through its Open Compute initiative . The new data centre housed in rural Oregon , USA is 38 per cent more energy efficient than its predecessor and has lowered Facebook 's costs by a whopping 24 per cent . Facebook announced on Thursday that it hopes to do the same for data centres around the world by making the blueprints for the technology available at the OpenCompute.org website . Evolving `` We started a project at Facebook a little over a year ago with a pretty big goal : to build one of the most efficient computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost , '' said a post on the site . `` We decided to honour our hacker roots and challenge convention by custom designing and building our software , servers and data centers from the ground up . `` The result is a data centre full of vanity free servers which is 38 per cent more efficient and 24 per cent less expensive to build and run than other state-of-the-art data centers . `` But we did n't want to keep it all for ourselves . Instead , we decided to collaborate with the entire industry and create the Open Compute Project , to share these technologies as they evolve . '' Inspired Facebook said it had been inspired by the open source software model and hopes to reap the benefits of the `` collaborative dialogue '' by eventually further lowering its own costs . The social networking company has also been under pressure from Greenpeace about its high energy consumption and has sent the new server plans to the organisation and requested feedback .

Facebook could well become a major force in Hollywood movie distribution , according to one of the social network 's primary investors . Venture capital firm Accel Investing is Facebook 's second-largest shareholder after founder Mark Zuckerberg - and is currently directing a significant amount of capital into certain Hollywood studios , hoping that Facebook will become an increasingly important movie distribution force in the near future . Facebook goes to the movies Accel recently dropped a cool $ 40 million investment in Legendary Pictures , the producer behind recent box-office favourites such as The Dark Knight . Meanwhile , Warner Bros is already trialling movie rentals using Facebook , with The Dark Knight already available for US viewers to watch via Zuckerberg 's website - for a fee . Accel exec Jim Breyer clearly thinks ( and hopes ) that Facebook will become an increasingly valuable distribution system for content producers in the near future , recently explaining to All Things Digital : `` We believe there are a number of extraordinary opportunities that sit at the intersection of content and social networking platforms like Facebook , '' hoping that Facebook will be able to provide Tinseltown with `` multichannel distribution capabilities for video content beyond classic theatrical and television release . '' `` At the heart of what Facebook is trying to do is enable outstanding content and application developers to develop breakthrough video and media applications , '' the Facebook investor added .

Facebook 's plans for world domination are continuing apace , with the social network nudging the television industry to use its Events check-in facility for their programming . The ability for users to check-in to events using Facebook Places is fairly new and in the vein of the likes of location-based networking sites like FourSquare . But Facebook says that TV programmers are missing a trick by not setting each show as a Facebook Event and allowing users to check in whenever they are watching . Passionate screaming over Top Gear ? Facebook 's head of international business development , Christian Hernandez Gallardo , said : `` You begin to create these hubs where you can take the passionate screaming and bring them together , because you realise that 10 of your friends are watching Top Gear at the same time . `` We 've talked to broadcasters about putting their whole EPG as events on Facebook , and letting people RSVP to them to get a reminder . '' While we ca n't endorse the watching of Top Gear , we can understand Facebook wanting to steal the social aspect of TV watching away from Twitter . X Factor effect As anyone who follows anyone who watches X Factor will know , there are certain times when Twitter becomes a no-go zone due to the sheer volume of updates about the current show . Social networks have become the modern-day 'watercooler ' for discussing must-watch TV shows , which are n't often watched by all at the same time in today 's post-PVR , on-demand world . But it 's not just television events that Facebook has its eye on . Hernandez continued , `` The thing I 'm dying to make social is the EPG . '' By using a Facebook ID , people would be able to log-in to their futuristic digital programme guides and see what their friends are watching , as well as getting personalised recommendations based on the programmes they have 'Liked ' in the past . Whether or not this remains a Facebook pipe-dream remains to be seen , but with televisions becoming ever-more connected , we would n't be surprised to see the Facebook EPG become a reality in the near future .

The Facebook for iPhone people have had a bit of a tinker under the hood and the app 's latest update brings with it the ability to unfriend people from your iPhone . When you 're out and about , and it hits you that you simply can not bear to remain Facebook friends with someone for another minute , you can not be expected to wait until you get home to de-friend them . In the past , you 'd have had to search out a quaint little place called an `` Internet Café '' and use a desktop computer to do so . Thank goodness those days are behind us , eh ? There was a time before Facebook , you know Also behind us are the days of not being able to check in to events and the absence of map view from Facebook Places . There have also been some minor improvmenets made to the news feed and the notifications UI . However , none of this makes up for the fact that 'unfriend ' is now , apparently , a word .

For many people , social networks are the internet : they 'll spend all day on Facebook or Twitter , with the odd break to visit an online shop or do some work . But the big networks are n't satisfied . They want more . Much more . They want your kids . Not literally , of course . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg does n't like the way the US Children 's Online Privacy Protection Act prevents Facebook from giving accounts to under-13s . But it 's not because he wants to make money from advertisers desperate to target the elusive and big-spending pre-teen market . No sirree . It 's because getting the wee ones on Facebook will make them clever , or something . `` In the future , software and technology will enable people to learn a lot from their fellow students , '' Zuckerberg says . Not that the law is actually preventing kids from using Facebook : as Chris Smith reports , around 7.5 million pre-teens are already on the site because they lied about their age . Social networks ' tentacles are wrapping themselves around more and more of the internet . Bing will integrate Facebook data to try and make search results more relevant , brands can use the revised Facebook photos system to see what people are saying about them , phones are becoming increasingly Facebook-friendly and it seems that Facebook and Spotify are teaming up so that you can play music through the site . Facebook 's even in the dictionary . Not everyone approves : Wikileaks founder Julian Assange says that `` Facebook in particular is the most appalling spying machine that has ever been invented '' and claims that `` Here we have the world 's most comprehensive database about people , their relationships , their names , their addresses , their locations , their communications with each other , their relatives , all sitting within the United States , all accessible to US intelligence . '' TweetDeck signs Twitter deal Facebook is n't the only social network that 's been in the news this week , of course . It turns out that Twitter is n't just for breaking superinjunctions - you can chat on it too ! Although Twitter has an enviable ecosystem of third-party clients , it 's becoming increasingly clear that Twitter would much prefer it if everyone used its own software - something we highlighted back in March . It 's already taken Atebits ' excellent Tweetie and made it an official Twitter client ; now , the power users ' favourite TweetDeck has been taken under Twitter 's wing too . TweetDeck creator Iain Dodsworth 's words are interesting : `` The mainstream Twitter user-base is well catered for by twitter.com and the official mobile clients , '' he says . `` And by becoming part of the official platform , TweetDeck will now fill that role for brands , influencers , the highly active and anyone that just needs 'more power ' . '' Is it just us , or does that imply that there 's no room for third-party clients any more ? Although Facebook and Twitter are very different networks and they 're doing very different things , they 've both got something very big in common : they 'd really like to have some more money . By keeping Twitter activity inside official clients , Twitter can push sponsored tweets , display ads and other money-making wheezes ; by getting everyone from birth to death to spend all day every day in Facebook , Mark Zuckerberg can simultaneously make some cash from targeted advertising while distracting us from the fact that he 's building Skynet .
Facebook is looking to all manner of media for the next step in its plans to take over the virtual world , according to a report in the New York Times . As well as its ongoing talks with Spotify , two anonymous sources have said that Facebook is in discussion with a number of other music services . The plan is to create a widget to show a Facebooker 's most recently played tracks and an easy way for friends to listen to the same songs . But it 's not just music Facebook is eyeing up ; the sources confirmed that it wants to do the same for video , news , TV shows and movies . Facebook intends to use outside partners to get around the issue of licensing music or video content , with each company partner offering a specialised news feed of the user 's listening and viewing habits . Friends then simply click on the video or song title to get in on the media action . No comment Facebook is staying tight-lipped on the matter , saying simply that `` We 're always looking for better ways to help people discover the most relevant content on Facebook but have nothing to announce . '' However , the rumours ring true with recent comments from both Facebook 's head of international business development , Christian Hernandez Gallardo and CEO Mark Zuckerberg . Hernandez Gallardo spoke about Facebook being a social hub for TV shows , `` You begin to create these hubs where you can take the passionate screaming and bring them together , because you realise that 10 of your friends are watching Top Gear at the same time . `` We 've talked to broadcasters about putting their whole EPG as events on Facebook , and letting people RSVP to them to get a reminder . '' Meanwhile , Zuckerberg hinted at the wider media focus : `` Listening to music is something that people do with their friends . Music , TV , news , books — those types of things I think people just naturally do with their friends . `` I hope we can play a part in enabling those new companies to get built , and companies that are out there producing this great content to become more social .

Facebook and Spotify have inked a deal to allow users to play songs through the social networking site , according to Forbes ' website . The service , which will be called either Spotify on Facebook or Facebook Music , could be launched as soon as the next two weeks The link-up will see the music streaming portal run in the background and will allow users access to Spotify 's extensive library and also simultaneously listen with friends using Facebook . Forbes says an icon will appear on the left-hand side of the Facebook news feed in every country that Spotify is currently available . It says the service is currently being tested extensively before launch . Media experiences The expected deal furthers Facebook 's commitment to making the site a portal for users to access entertainment content like games and movies . Earlier today at the e-G8 summit , Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke of how integrating `` media experiences '' was the next step in Facebook 's evolution . `` Listening to music is something people do with their friends , '' he said . `` Movies , TV , news , books - those types of things are things I think people just naturally do with their friends . `` I hope we can play a part in enabling those new companies to get built , and companies that are out there producing this great content to become more social . '' The partnership between Spotify and Facebook , which Forbes claims does n't involve money changing hands between the companies , will allow Spotify to plug its premium subscription service . One site to rule ... For its end , Facebook will have another great piece of functionality that will fulfill its long-standing goal of making the site the only one you ever have to visit . Spotify has so far denied knowledge of the deal , while Facebook is yet to comment . If the partnership is confirmed it would be one of the biggest new media hook-ups in recent memory .

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has played down the role the site played in the Arab Spring protests . Speaking at the e-G8 summit of digital leaders in Paris , Zuckerberg spoke of the protests that saw revolutions occur in Tunisia and Egypt and many other Arab nations revolt against ruling regimes . Facebook and Twitter have been credited as catalysts for the protests by enabling greater communication and ease of organisation , but Zuckerberg has backed away from taking credit . Arrogant `` Facebook was neither necessary nor sufficient for any of those things to happen , '' he told the forum . `` It would be extremely arrogant for any specific technology company to claim credit . `` People are now having the opportunity to communicate , that 's not a Facebook thing . That 's an Internet thing . '' The revolution in Egypt back saw one proud father name his daughter Facebook as a tribute to the impact made in ousting long-standing president Hosni Mubarak .

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he will fight a long-standing legal ruling that prevents children under 13 joining the social networking site . Under the Children 's Online Privacy Protection Act , Facebook is prohibited from giving profiles to pre-teen kids . However , with comments that are sure to provoke outrage , Zuckerberg claims that it is important for the education of children that they are able to join sites like Facebook from a younger age . `` That will be a fight we take on at some point . My philosophy is that for education you need to start at a really , really young age , '' he said at the NewSchools summit in California . `` In the future , software and technology will enable people to learn a lot from their fellow students , '' he added . Defend Despite the legalities , it is already estimated that 7.5m children under-13 are already on the site because they lied about their age when signing up . Zuckerberg came under heavy criticism in a US Senate committee last week for failing to protect children from predators as it does not employ enough people to review posts . US Senator John Rockerfeller told one Facebook executive in attendance that `` I want you to defend your company here because I do n't know how you can . '' Source : IBTimes

Facebook has adopted PhotoDNA , Microsoft-made image tracking software , in order to prevent child pornography from being uploaded to the social network . Facebook is a hugely controlled environment , but with over 6 billion photos uploaded each month , such photos inevitably slip through the net – and Zuckerberg and co are intent on stamping them out . PhotoDNA was developed by Microsoft specifically for the purpose of tracking down images of child abuse , and Facebook will put the system to work later this week . Hashing robustly It works by `` robust hashing '' – analysing and recording the unique characteristics of each image ( its DNA ) , assigning a unique code ( 'hash ' ) to them and matching this to other instances of the same image , even if it has been cropped or altered . Because each photo 's DNA is relatively small , the software can sift through billions of images very quickly , and remove any bad ones . Unfortunately this does mean that only known images can be tracked down ; original imagery will continue to rely on other Facebook users reporting them to the site moderators . But since Microsoft donated the PhotoDNA tech to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2009 , around 10,000 images can now be searched for , with more being added all the time – a fact that 's more bad than good .

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss , the twins who claim that the idea for Facebook was stolen from them by Mark Zuckerberg , are taking their case to the US Supreme Court . In early April , a panel of judges told the twins that they could not back out of a settlement already reached with the social network in order to pursue another one . The current deal nets the Winklevii over $ 20 million in cash plus $ 45 million in shares . The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco , complete with a panel of 11 judges , has now also rejected the appeal , prompting the Winklevoss twins and their lawyer to head to the US Supreme Court . The twins want to wriggle out of the existing settlement because they claim that Facebook told the court that shares were worth more than they actually were in order to reach that settlement ; lower-valued shares would have meant that the Winklevosses would have been awarded a greater number which would appreciate to provide greater return . Supremely courteous The Supreme Court is the destination for any case in which conflicting rulings have been made ; but since that is n't exactly the case for Winklevoss and Winklevoss v. Facebook , it may opt not to hear the case at all . Clearly the Winklevoss twins still feel they ought to be awarded a greater slice of the Facebook pie , but the courts , like many of us , seem to reckon they should be happy with their already multi-million-dollar lot . Still , it 's all good fodder for The Social Network 2 , eh Hollywood ? Via PhysOrg
Microsoft 's Bing search engine will integrate data from Facebook to bring more personalised search results . Microsoft is hoping that tying Bing into Facebook will increase the search engine 's popularity as it battles it out for market share against Google . Essentially , the search engine will factor in Facebook friend recommendations into its search functionality , to personalise your results Fuelled by emotions ? `` The best decisions are not just fuelled by facts , they require the opinions and emotions of your friends , '' said Yusuf Mehdi , senior vice president , Bing . `` Search is now more than a fact finder — we 're marrying fact-based search results with your friends ' street smarts to combine the best data on the Web with the opinions of the people you trust the most and the collective IQ of the Web . '' With relationships fractious between Facebook and Google at the moment – with bickering over the use of open data turning into unsavoury smear campaigns from the former – Microsoft is keen to take advantage . Splashing the MS cash The Redmond-based software giant is making some massive deals at the current time , using its deep pockets to try to buy market share in key areas such as phone OS ( with Nokia ) , video calls ( with the purchase of Skype ) and search , with an agreement with China 's Baidu coming soon and now a Facebook tie in . `` Starting today , you can receive personalized search results based on the opinions of your friends by simply signing into Facebook , '' stated the Bing blog . `` New features make it easier to see what your Facebook friends `` like '' across the web , incorporate the collective know-how of the web into your search results , and begin adding a more conversational aspect to your searches . `` Decisions can now be made with more than facts , now the opinions of your trusted friends and the collective wisdom of the web .

Facebook and Google have been at loggerheads this week , with the news that Facebook hired a PR firm to look into Google and its apparent violation of users ' privacy causing uproar . The PR firm in question was the US-based Burson-Marsteller , which was told to pitch the idea to news agencies that Google 's Social Circle feature was violating privacy . Facebook has released a statement with regards to the reasoning behind hiring the PR firm , telling Cnet that it was not trying to muster up a 'smear campaign ' against Google but was trying to gauge the reaction of third parties when they found out about Social Circles and the potential privacy problems of the service . Private parts `` No 'smear ' campaign was authorised or intended , '' explained a Facebook spokesperson . `` Instead , we wanted third parties to verify that people did not approve of the collection and use of information from their accounts on Facebook and other services for inclusion in Google Social Circles – just as Facebook did not approve of use or collection for this purpose . `` We engaged Burson-Marsteller to focus attention on this issue , using publicly available information that could be independently verified by any media organisation or analyst . `` The issues are serious and we should have presented them in a serious and transparent way . '' The argument between Facebook and Google all stems from Google stopping Facebook from data-mining its Google Contacts information to put on its site . This , in turn , made Facebook come up with a workaround , which then prompted Google to write a narky statement when users used the workaround , berating Facebook 's lack of openness . The new revelation that Facebook has been hiring a PR firm to look into Google 's tactics has definitely left the social network in a pretty poor light , but there 's a definite feeling of 'the pot calling the kettle black ' from both companies on the issue of privacy .

Facebook has updated its photo tagging system , allowing users to tag brands and celebrities ' official Facebook pages in their snaps . The social network has also given the tagging interface a little makeover , opting for a black box instead of blue – big news . With the new system , brands will be able to keep an eye on any photos they 're tagged in , as well as report any misuse of tags – we 're sure Sony would complain if you tagged an LG TV as a Sony one , for example . Or if you tagged a leaky sieve as a PS3 . Free marketing You 'll have to be a fan of said brand or dodgy '90s celeb in order to tag them in your photos – better get 'friending ' your best celeb spots , eh ? There 's no real benefit to you personally tagging anything other than your friends at present – you 'd essentially be giving these brands free advertising – but there 's potential for the system to be used in promotions and competitions in the future . Facebook 's new tagging system is rolling out as we speak .

Collins has added 3,000 new words to its list of Official Scrabble Words , including internet-inspired phrases 'Facebook ' , 'wiki ' , 'webzine ' and 'inbox ' . With a bit of strategic manoeuvring , the ever-successful 'Facebook ' could net you 57 points ( 19 points on a triple word score ) , while the somewhat out-dated 'webzine ' is worth 21 . Scrabble fans will be pleased at the new opportunities to get rid of those pesky Zs and Xs , while English professors the world over ( not to mention your gran ) will likely groan at the pervasive nature of the online dialect , practically baragouin to offliners . Letter gangs Still , it could be worse . Oh wait , it is worse , with '90s favourites 'innit ' , 'grrl ' , 'blingy ' , 'thang ' , and 'gak ' all now making the Scrabble grade . What next ? Kwyjibo ? Robert Groves , editor of Collins English Dictionaries and editor of the latest word list for Scrabble users , said : `` The latest edition adds nearly 3,000 new words to the existing quarter of a million available to Scrabble players . `` These additions are an eclectic mix of new technological jargon , overseas English , recent colloquialisms , street slang , and a few fairly well-established phrases that had not made it onto the list until now .

Sony Ericsson has told TechRadar that it is planning to update its latest crop of smartphones to include much deeper Facebook integration . The Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini and Mini Pro both come with new Facebook features , including the ability to like songs and photos directly from the phone , as well as seeing galleries from the handset without opening the application . However , a Sony Ericsson spokesperson told us that in ' a couple of quarters ' the Facebook functionality would be improved again , offering a deeper experience than ever before . Social API ? While the spokesperson would n't elaborate on details , the likelihood is that this will include further use of the Social Graph API , which allows phone manufacturers to only show you information from the friends you interact with most - similar to the INQ Cloud Touch . The spokesperson also confirmed that the new Facebook functionality will be coming to the Xperia Arc , Xperia Play , Xperia Neo and the Xperia X10 when the new Gingerbread update lands , although would n't give a timeframe for when the update will happen . The Xperia Mini and Mini Pro are set for a UK release date of Q3 2011 , so we 'd imagine the new update would land on the other handsets at roughly the same time .

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has accused three of the web 's heavyweights as being tools for the US intelligence service . In an exclusive interview with RT.com , the Wikileaks founder berates Facebook , Google , and Yahoo explaining that Google and Yahoo `` have built-in interfaces for US intelligence . '' His remarks about Facebook were even more cutting , with Assange saying the social network can be used for spying by the US and we are all doing the intelligence agencies ' business for them . Spy machine `` Facebook in particular is the most appalling spying machine that has ever been invented , '' said Assange . `` Here we have the world 's most comprehensive database about people , their relationships , their names , their addresses , their locations , their communications with each other , their relatives , all sitting within the United States , all accessible to US intelligence . '' While Assange does n't think that Zuckerberg and co are employed by the CIA , he does feel that Facebook is a major tool for the US government . `` Is it the case that Facebook is run by US intelligence ? No , it 's not like that . It is the case that US intelligence can bring to bear legal and political pressure to them and it is costly for them to hand out records one by one , so they have automated the process . '' `` Everyone should understand that when they add their friends to Facebook they are doing free work for the US Intelligence agencies , in building this database for them . '' Via Cnet

George Hotz , a hacker who managed to jailbreak the PS3 , is now working for Facebook and it seems he will be helping the social network on its iOS app output . This is according to SlashGear , which has figured out through various Facebook posts and a shout out in a developer podcast that GeoHot ( to give him his hacking name ) is now working under the tutelage of the social network . As it has n't been made official , it is not yet understood quite what Hotz is working on . It does look as if he will be helping out with iOS apps for the company , though . Status update It was revealed last week that Facebook was working on an iPad app and GeoHot has got some history with iOS , given that he was the creator of the limra1n exploit – which was the basis of the recent iOS 5 jailbreak . In a Facebook update , Hotz pretty much confirmed he was a Facebook employee , stating that he had just come back from one of the company 's hackathons . It must have been nice for him to go to something that was to do with hacking a big corporate company , without the fear that the internet thought police were just around the corner ready to nab him .

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss , who yesterday settled a long-running court case against Facebook for a not-too-shabby payout of £48 million , have filed a new lawsuit against the social network and its CEO , Mark Zuckerberg . The new case , filed in Boston , suggests that Facebook and Zuckerberg `` intentionally or inadvertently suppressed evidence '' in the recently-settled lawsuit . The Winklevosses and their partner Divya Narendra have long maintained that Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social network while at Harvard University , repurposed it into Facebook and became the mega multimillionaire that he is today . It 's not over 'til it 's over The filing claims that Facebook and other parties withheld evidence from the Winklevosses and their lawyers , including a bizarre twist in which the twin 's new legal team are having trouble getting files from their old legal team . Having been immortalised in David Fincher 's The Social Network , the Winklevoss twins ' never-ending quest for justice has not done much to endear them to the Facebook-using public . If the courts rule in favour of the Winklevii in this new case , it could give the twins the fuel they need to re-open the previous case . Lucky for the Hollywood franchise - that should be enough fuel to take it up to The Social Network 5 or 6 , by our reckoning .
Do you have hundreds of friends on Facebook ? Then it 's a good idea to take the time to organise them into different groups , or lists as Facebook describes them . Lists can be used for privacy reasons - to exclude certain status updates , for example - or simply to simplify the sharing of links , photographs and status updates with a common group of people , such as your family members . When referring to other Facebook users in your status updates , you can create a link to that person 's profile quickly and easily - just type @ followed by the first few letters of their name , and then select them from the list that pops up . While sharing the odd photo or movie through Facebook is easy enough , it can be time-consuming fiddling about with photo albums , particularly when all the functionality you need for sharing both photos and video can be found in Windows Live Photo Gallery and Windows Live Movie Maker . Prepare your photos or movies in these tools , then quickly upload them by clicking the Facebook button , which can be found on the Home tab in both applications . Spend too much time replicating blog posts or Twitter comments in your Facebook statuses ? Just tie them both into your Facebook account - install the WordBook plug-in on your Wordpress blog to automatically update your Facebook status every time you post to your blog . There 's also an official Twitter app in Facebook that does the same with your tweets , but it does n't allow you to choose which tweets filter through to your blog ; instead , install the Selective Tweet Status app and then you choose exactly which tweets get posted to Facebook by adding the # fb hashtag to the end of your tweet . Facebook shortcuts The following Facebook shortcuts work in Chrome . If you are using Firefox , then you 'll need to add Shift ( eg Shift + Alt + 1 ) . In IE , you 'll need to hit Return after pressing the Alt key with a corresponding number . Note that not every shortcut appears to work in every browser - give them a try and see which ones work for you . Alt and 1 : Show your news feed . Alt and 2 : Switch to your profile . Alt and 3 : View pop-up of any friend requests . Alt and 4 : View pop-up of any messages . Alt and 5 : View pop-up notifications . Alt and 6 : Show account settings . Alt and 7 : Switch to privacy settings . Alt and 8 : View Facebook 's own profile . Alt and 9 : Read latest Terms of Service agreement . Alt and 0 : Open the Facebook Help centre .

The Winklevoss twins , who have been engrained into the history of Facebook thanks to the movie The Social Network , have finally accepted a $ 65 million ( £48 million ) payout from Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook . This comes after the twins decided to re-ignite their feud with Facebook and Zuckerberg – who they initially claimed took the idea of the social network from them – by trying to undo the settlement they agreed on in 2008 . In April , however , this was turned down by the Supreme Court and while they were going to appeal in May the twins have now made the decision not to . `` After careful consideration [ the ] appellants no longer oppose issuance of the mandate , and have no objection to vacatur of the stay of issuance of mandate , '' said the filing . Taking stock The Winklevoss case is one of the more interesting in the tech world , given that it stems from Zuckerberg 's time at Harvard with the twins . Originally they accused Zuckerberg of breaking an 'oral contract ' with the twins , where he said he would complete work with them on their university social network idea , the Harvard Connection . Instead of completing this website , Zuckerberg went on to make TheFacebook – a social networking site that was originally restricted to Harvard graduates . One of the reasons not to appeal may be to do with the amount of stock on offer . The money bundle has been split as £12.5 million in cash , £28 million in stock . With estimates that Facebook could well be worth £100 billion in 2012 , that stock option is now looking a lot more favourable than it did back in 2008 .

Skype has just released a new beta version for Windows which includes a host of Facebook features , including Facebook chat integration . The Skype 5.5 Beta does n't allow you to call your Facebook friends , but does allow you to chat with them from within Skype , rather than having to log in to your Facebook profile . There 's also a new Facebook Contacts tab in the software , which is populated with all your Facebook friends , obviously , and lets you comment and 'Like ' statuses on the social network . Video poke Rumours that Skype has been working with Facebook to integrate video calling into the social network 's services have been milled for months , but we 're yet to see that functionality . In October last year , Skype introduced the Facebook news feed and the ability to call friends ' mobiles and landlines from within Skype , but it 's online video calling between Facebookers that will be the killer feature . However , now that Microsoft has bought Skype , it 's likely that the company will be keen to utilise ( and monetise ) Skype 's video calling prowess elsewhere in its business .
Facebook 's upcoming music service looks likely to launch with the help of a number of big name streaming partners , it has been revealed . This is according to GigaOm , which rounded up everything it knows about the music platform ; including rumours that Spotify wo n't be the only partnership in Facebook 's musical endeavour . Although just what partnerships will be involved is not yet known , it is thought that a potential release date for the service will be at Facebook 's f8 conference in August . What is known is how the music service will work . Facebook is looking to integrate music into the site 's normal homepage and use a tab for music , which will be situated under the other tabs currently on the left-hand side of the page , like Places , Pages and Games . Click on this tab and a music dashboard will appear . To play the tracks you want to , you just use the playback button at the bottom of the Facebook page . Get connected It seems like the whole service relies on Facebook Connect – so you have to Connect with whichever music service you want for it to work through the Facebook page . On the music dashboard there will be recommended songs . You will also be able to see what all your other friends are listening too at any particular time – and presumably mock them if a bit of Blue ends up on their digital stereo . Facebook has remained tight-lipped over its music service , so expect more rumour and speculation to come in dribs and drabs . The idea to mix music with social is an intriguing one – as we have seen with Ping , it does n't always work . But unlike Apple , which tried to bring the social to the music , Facebook is bringing music to the social , something which is a much easier prospect .

Facebook is finally preparing to release its official application for the Apple iPad after almost a year in development , according to reports . The New York Times claims that the app has been through several different design iterations , but is now nearly ready to go , with founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg heavily involved in the process . The app , which has been meticulously optimised for the the Apple tablet , completely revamps the Facebook Chat and Facebook Groups portions of the site , according to the NYT 's inside source . Photos will also appear full-screen and in high-resolution and iPad 2 owners will be able to use the device 's camera in order to take and upload pictures directly to their profiles . Nothing to see here Facebook has refused to comment on the report , but was keen to play up its strong relationship with Apple . `` We have a great relationship with Apple that is exemplified by our iPhone application , but with regards to an iPad application we have nothing to announce now , and can not comment on future Facebook products , '' said communications manager Jamie Schopflin . Friendly iPad owners have had to rely on third-party apps like the decent-but-unreliable Friendly , while also accessing Facebook through the Safari browser on the iPad . The BlackBerry Playbook was the first device to boast a tablet-optimised official Facebook app and it now looks as though Apple fans will get their wish sooner rather than later .

Facebook is hoping to break the App Store 's stranglehold on the iOS app-sphere by launching its own store within the Safari mobile browser , according to reports . The ambitious plan , codenamed Project Spartan , would see Facebook begin to peddle HTML5 browser-based applications , meaning it and not the App Store would take a cut from the sales . According to TechCrunch , Farmville creator Zynga and the Huffington Post are already on-board with Facebook 's cheeky scheme , along with 80 other developers . The report claims that the project has been in development for two months , with the company aiming to launch the service in the next few weeks . Android plans also afoot TechCrunch also reckons that Facebook plans to replicate the service for Android users , although that is a secondary concern at present . Speculation suggests that Facebook 's brazen offensive comes as a result of Twitter 's agreement to be the single sign-on partner for iOS 5 . Back at WWDC Apple revealed that Twitter would be deeply integrated within iOS 5 . Is this Facebook 's way of ensuring it gets a piece of the pie too ? Source : TechCrunch

Aside from 'liking ' to your heart 's content , the bar also allows you to check out your Facebook news feed , update your status , like a page or comment on other posts without needing to open Facebook in the browser . Other less interesting features also available Aside from the Facebook features , the Bing Bar 7 offers news , travel info , weather updates and at-a-glance email from all your webmail accounts in a single drop-down box . The toolbar can also translate web pages , offers a shortcut to MSN Video Player for on-demand content and , of course , allows you to search the web using Bing . If you find yourself in the market for a new toolbar and the Bing Bar 7 tickles your fancy , just head over to the website to download it now .
It seems that Facebook does n't have as many friends as it would like : according to figures released yesterday , while the site is growing overall it 's losing users in the US and the UK . Facebook has issued a carefully worded statement that casts doubt on the reliability of the figures , although the firm has n't actually denied that it 's losing users ; it 's `` very happy with its growth '' . The figures could be the result of a seasonal drop . I do n't think that 's the case , though . Nothing lasts forever , and Facebook 's explosive growth is no exception . I called it far too early - back in 2009 , in fact- but social networks ' growth depends on everybody adding friends . When everybody is online , there are no more friends to add . As I wrote previously : `` Once you 've added everybody you can think of , including people you 'll later regret adding , you tend to stop sending invites . The fun wears off , you update your status less frequently , you get fed up fending off stupid requests to use stupid applications , and you start looking for a new playground . '' It did n't happen in 2009 , and it might not be happening just yet . But sooner or later , Facebook will reach market saturation . And when that happens , it 's going to have to clean up its act . Shaduppa your Facebook Firms experiencing constant growth can get away with a lot . For every person they annoy , they sign up dozens of new recruits . It 's the budget airline effect : for every person who vows never to fly with you again , there 's a dozen newcomers going `` ooh ! That 's quite cheap ! '' Social networks also benefit from lock-in . I hate Facebook : I hate its horrible UI , its overly complex privacy settings , its photo albums , the algorithm that seems hell-bent on hiding important and interesting updates . Given the choice , I would n't use it . Unfortunately I do n't have a choice , because for now everybody I know does use it . Cutting off Facebook would mean cutting them off . Sooner or later , though , a strategy of `` ha ha ! We 're the only game in town ! '' will bite you in the backside . Just ask Microsoft . Customers bitched about Windows , and they moaned about Windows , and they stuck with Windows because everybody else used it too . That left the door open for Apple , and today Apple is worth as much as Microsoft , HP and Dell combined . Facebook is n't a public company yet , but if it does go public it 'll have to deliver results to investors . That could make it even more annoying than it is already , and if it upsets enough people it could see existing users flee . Network effects work in reverse , too . Just ask MySpace . An Apple to Facebook 's Microsoft has n't emerged yet , but it 's just a matter of time .
Facebook has spoken out on the subject of apparent falling user stats , dismissing them as inaccurate . Yesterday we reported on the stats which suggested that around 6 million US users had stopped using Facebook , while a fall of 100,000 UK users was also indicated . A spokesperson for the social network told TechRadar , `` From time to time , we see stories about Facebook losing users in some regions . `` Some of these reports use data extracted from our advertising tool , which provides broad estimates on the reach of Facebook ads and is n't designed to be a source for tracking the overall growth of Facebook . '' Still growing `` We are very pleased with our growth and with the way people are engaged with Facebook . More than 50 per cent of our active users log on to Facebook in any given day , '' it concluded . Still , Facebook has n't actually proven that its user base in the UK and US remains as robust as ever ; we 've got a call in to ComScore , a reputable traffic tracker , about that . But it did point out that these stories do tend to pop up at about the same time each year – that is , early summer . There 's a definite case to suggest that any drop-off in Facebook use reported by advertising tools could well be down to the improving weather when people would rather be out and about than feverishly F5-ing their Facebook feeds . The spurious stats sparked some heated debate between Twitter and Facebook advocates on TechRadar 's respective pages ; it seems that the Tweeters do n't like Facebook much , while Zuckerberg 's Army are n't all that fond of Twitter . Who knew ?

A female juror in a high profile drugs trial will appear in court this week , charged with contempt , after allegedly contacting the accused through Facebook . Joanne Fraill is said to have contacted defendant Jamie Stewart using the social networking site during the trial in Manchester last year , causing it to collapse . Ms Stewart had been acquitted as a result , but also faces charges of contempt of court on Tuesday . The trial was one of many connected to the same case , which are believed to have cost the UK taxpayer up to £6 million . Juror misconduct The case will be heard by Lord Judge , the Lord Chief Justice , says The Guardian , and will coincide with the appeal of a convicted defendant who claims that the alleged juror misconduct means his conviction should also be thrown out . The charges are the second time that social networking sites have made big news in court this year following a landmark ruling allowing journalists to use Twitter in court . Source : Guardian
Facebook may be inching ever-closer to the 700 million user mark , but user numbers have begun falling in the UK and US . Update : Facebook has now responded to and disputed the data reported here . The US , in particular , experienced its first fall in monthly active users , losing almost six million in May this year . At the same time , the UK posted losses of over 100,000 active users in May , although overall Facebook users grew to 687 million during the month . This does n't necessarily mean that people are actively deleting their profiles , however , rather that they simply are n't using their Facebook accounts . Other countries that were relatively early to the Facebook phenomenon are also seeing fewer Facebookers , places including Canada , Norway and Russia . Twitter likes this Although it 's not a huge surprise to see growth slow as Facebook reaches saturation point in certain countries , overall growth also seems to have slowed down during both April and May , which could indicate a wider loss of interest in the social network . The company that collated the user data , Inside Facebook , concedes that bugs in its tools and seasonal changes ( including better weather ) can skew the numbers , so it 's definitely not time to start predicting that Facebook will go the way of MySpace . But now that we 've established exactly how successful we are in relation to our most popular classmates and with privacy concerns rumbling on , perhaps our lust to 'Like ' is beginning to wane .

Facebook has confirmed that its face detecting 'tag suggestions ' system has now rolled out to the whole world , having been in use in the USA since December 2010 . The new tech sees Facebook keeping track of what faces are tagged with which names so it can begin suggesting who 's in your photos as you upload them . The idea is to save the time and effort that all that pesky manual tagging requires , but some paranoid androids are upset that Facebook rolled the new feature out with no warning . Face time Face detecting does mean that Facebook is storing extra data on you , but it 's not hugely different to it knowing what your face looks like when you 're manually tagged in a photo anyway , as far as we see it . Still , if you 're concerned that Facebook can recognise your face , you can opt out of being automatically tagged in any photographs your friends upload . So today 's screaming headlines are n't wrong ; Facebook does knows what you look like . Just like it always has .

Vodafone is reportedly launching its own Facebook phone to bring mobile social networking to those on a budget . Looking similar to an HTC ChaCha in style , as it comes with a QWERTY keyboard and silver chassis , the leaked picture shows a phone with the same dedicated Facebook key too . This information comes courtesy of Unwired View , which claims it was sent a tiny photo of the phone , which does n't appear to have any Vodafone branding on it . Android ? Pah What 's more worrying is the fact it 's not running Android or any kind of smartphone OS - we 're hoping something like Qualcomm 's BREW might be secretly on there as we do n't need any more proprietary OS handsets out there . Of course , if the phone costs something like £20 with a decent data bundle for Facebook fun , we 'd understand Vodafone 's decision to eschew Android simply to get a device out the door . But given that it looks a helluva lot like the ChaCha , we 'll be very interested to see where the Big Red Network thinks this will fit in the market .

When a German teen inadvertently invited thousands of strangers to her sixteenth-birthday party via Facebook this month , a predictable amount of chaos and confused policing ensued . The German teenager , named Thessa , forgot to ensure that her invite for the Facebook event set for her party was set to private . This soon spiralled into 15,000 people confirming their attendance at her birthday party , with around 1,600 turning up at her parent 's house on the night of the shindig . Chaos , violence , fires Having understood the potential chaos that could ( and did ) ensue , the girl alerted Hamburg police and had fled the scene to spend the day and night `` at an undisclosed location '' with her grandparents . Hamburg police said Sunday that 11 people were detained , one police officer was injured , lots of youngsters were cutting their feet on broken glass and firemen had to extinguish two small fires at the scene . Around 100 police were at the scene to attempt to try to maintain order throughout the night . `` It was by and large a peaceful party , '' said a Hamburg police spokesperson . `` There were some fires set alight , some acts of violence and with considerable alcohol consumption there was some property damage . There have been larger organised birthday parties in Hamburg but this may be the largest unorganised birthday party ever . '' Via Reuters

Social gaming giant Zynga must be celebrating today , hearing the news that Facebook is close to 700 million registered users . Yep . In other words , that 's 700,000,000 potential FarmVille players . The latest Facebook user stats come courtesy of Socialbakers , a handy Facebook statistics tracker , which alerted us to the fact that Facebook is closing in on that 700 million mark . UK in third place The US currently has over 149 million users on Facebook and Indonesia has just over 37 million , while here in the UK we sit proudly ( we think ! ) in third place in the Facebook user charts , with a shade over 29 million registered users . The numbers of Facebook users in emerging markets such as Brazil , Indonesia , the Philippines , Mexico and Argentina are growing most rapidly . India , Colombia , Egypt and Turkey are all also in the top ten in terms of numbers of Facebook users in each country . 700 million users ! Bonkers…
Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has revealed that Google tried to partner with Facebook but was rebuffed in its attempts to strike a deal . Speaking at the D9 section of the AllThingsD conference , Schmidt confirmed that a deal was investigated but refused to go into detail over what Google was trying to achieve : `` We tried very hard to partner with Facebook , '' he said , according to Reuters . `` They were unwilling to do the deal . '' `` Three years ago I wrote memos talking about this general problem . I knew that I had to do something and I failed to do it . A CEO should take responsibility , I screwed up . '' Let 's all get social Schmidt did reveal that Google is still attempting to become the 'alternative ' to Facebook , believing that identity-based social features are one of the things he has 'admired ' from the company rivalling Google for top dog on the internet . According to TechCrunch Schmidt said that Google would be looking to add such things into its services , but as a way to add value rather than take on the Zucker-powered behemoth . He also said that Google had recently re-signed a deal with Apple to continue using the company 's mapping services on the iPad and iPhone for the foreseeable future , quashing rumours Apple is set to launch its own rival platform .

Facebook has made its 'tag suggestions ' feature , which uses facial-recognition software , easier to disable after concerns were raised about its invasiveness . Some users of the 750 million-member social network had complained that this feature was intrusive , including US Attorney General George Jepsen , who wrote a letter to Facebook complaining that storing data about users ' faces was a threat to basic human rights . Facebook responded with a blog post last month , explaining that it is now posting adverts on the website which allow users to easily opt out of using the technology completely . The social network also promises to delete any facial recognition data stored on its system once users opt-out . Your face or mine ? Facebook , which had hoped that users `` would find the results to be helpful and useful '' , should not really be surprised that these complaints arose , having stealthily rolled the feature out to users around the world over the course of the year . Google 's Picasa and the Apple OS iPhoto programme also use forms of facial-detection but were more for personal use and you could choose whether to use them or not . On Facebook though , 'tag suggestions ' were made a default feature and constantly asked `` who is this ? '' to its users when they uploaded images . It remains to be seen how Google will make use of its recently acquired Pitt Patt facial-recognition software , with rumours that it could be integrated with the Google+ social network , Google Goggles or even YouTube , signalling that the privacy debate may be far from over .
Vodafone 's group terminals director has told TechRadar that the new 555 Blue is the first in a line of non-smartphone Facebook devices . Patrick Chomet confirmed that the network is looking to replicate the deep integration on the 555 Blue on other handsets : `` What we will do continue to use the experience as a category , the Facebook , as a vertical experience , and probably we will do a version two , version three etc . `` We are working already , could work on the same thing and extend it to a touchscreen . `` So we are working on and looking at various things [ for future Facebook devices ] , such as touchscreens , 3G connectivity , nicer designs , better camera - now we have the core working , and hopefully it 's a success , we will take it and develop it further . '' Smarter features ? When quizzed about the decision to eschew Android , Chomet said it was a hard choice but one that offered the chance to make something that created a deeper Facebook experience than ever before , and offers easy replication : `` It 's not easy to do [ to create a feature phone based on Facebook ] , you could always just do the app but we wanted to do it this way and we 've had our guys plugged in with Facebook engineers for one year . `` That 's the price you have to pay to create a feature phone - if you have a smartphone you just do an app , but with a feature phone the phone is the app , so we only have to create the experience once . '' It will be interesting to see how a dedicated Facebook device , which is likely to be a little higher on the pre-pay scale at around £70-£75 , will fare compared to the do-it-all smartphones users are increasingly flocking to when choosing their next device .

Facebook appears to have hidden its upcoming iPad app in the code of the existing iPhone one , suggesting that the app 's launch is not far off . Despite being eighteen months old , the iPad is yet to get an official Facebook app , with Apple tablet users settling for the web version or the scaled-up iPhone app . TechCrunch has posted a rather gushing hands on with the app , which points out the `` great '' navigation system , `` great '' use of overlay menus and the `` great '' looking photo viewer , which is similar to the iPad gallery app . Facebook feeds The look and feel of the app is certainly in keeping with the iPad 's interface , with familiar icons and layout as standard . As well as access to the regular Facebook news feed , the app offers photo upload , Facebook chat , Places check-ins and the ability to toggle feed filters . It 's not clear if iPad Facebook chat incorporates the newly launched , Skype-powered Facebook video calling , however . The app , which is built in HTML5 , still appears to be being built , with a source noting that HTML changes are being rolled out on an hourly basis ; but it 's safe to say we 're not far off a Facebook iPad app release .

Google 's executive chairman Eric Schmidt has admitted that the search giant should have put more effort into a Facebook-alike social network earlier . In an interview with CNN , former CEO Schmidt expressed his frustration that his company had not worked on a more personal approach to the internet earlier . `` Fundamentally , what Facebook has done is built a way to figure out who people are . That system is missing in the internet as a whole . Google should have worked on this earlier , '' said Schmidt . Resources `` I think that 's the area where I would have put more resources , developing these identity services and ranking systems that go along with that . That would have made a big difference for the internet as a whole , '' he added . Facebook has emerged as a true rival to Google web dominance , despite concerns over privacy . With Google+ showing promising early signs , the question remains : could Facebook 's social networking market share have been impacted if Google had got its act together earlier .

Facebook has announced a new version of its mobile application specifically designed for non-smartphone users . The idea is to make the mobile Facebook experience more accessible to both users that eschew the smartphone lifestyle and those in the developing nations where the advanced mobile is less prevalent . Facebook is making a big deal about the fact the new application ( which works on Java-enabled feature phones ) will be less data-hungry than other Java applications , or browsing to the mobile website , allowing those without data plans to save a little cash . Facebook reloaded Facebook has teamed up with Three in the UK to offer 90 days of free access to the new application - thankfully , unlike drug dealers , we doubt Facebook will offer a smashing site for three months then start mixing the Java equivalent of Persil into the mix once new users are hooked on updating statuses anywhere . The new application will run on over 2,500 mobiles on the market already , and Facebook is promising more compatible phones in the future too - if you want to try it for yourself , simply enter d.facebook.com/install into your mobile browser to get going . And if we 've not painted a decent enough picture of the app , then why not check out Facebook 's video of the new application in action ? Be warned - it 's running on a Nokia phone , so if you 're one of the many commenters who have turned on the Finnish brand , steel yourself now .

A software developer has discovered a string of code that suggests that Facebook 's long-rumoured music service will be called Facebook Vibes . Jeff Rose spotted that the code , which relates to the social network 's recently released video chat feature , includes reference to another app , `` facebook.vibes '' . In a blog post , he writes , `` The vibes app connects with a music download dialog in the page though , so I 'm guessing that with this release we are seeing the seeds for Facebook 's upcoming music offering . '' Just vibing , man The name was just about the only thing that had n't leaked about Facebook 's upcoming music dashboard , with rumours circling that it will launch in August . The social network looks set to use Facebook Connect and integrate a music player into the site 's newsfeed page , housing it in a tab on the left hand side of the page . Zuckerberg and his cronies have apparently already inked a deal with Spotify , with rumours suggesting that other music services are also set to come on board .

Google 's executive chairman Eric Schmidt has revealed his hopes for the company 's new social networking service , Google+ , saying that he 'd welcome more interaction with Twitter and Facebook . Speaking to journalists at a media conference in Idaho , Schmidt admitted that he 'd `` love to have deeper integration with Twitter and Facebook . '' But attempts to get the two social networks on board have n't yet borne fruit with Facebook resisting Google 's talks over importing Facebook friends . Twitterbook+ Twitter , too , has n't been able to see eye-to-eye with Google and its big plans ; the two companies ' search deal recently ended without renewal as they could n't agree terms . Schmidt quite rightly pointed out that it is too early to say how Google+ is doing but did big up video hang outs , which he said are very popular with younger users . But now that Facebook has launched its own Skype-powered video chat feature , Google+ may lose some users to Zuckerberg 's bigger and better-established network . From Reuters

Is Google+ a legitimate threat to Facebook or just another half-baked social network ? The service already shows promise as the latest challenger to the throne with features for selectively posting content , chatting in a private hub called a Hangout , and viewing a news stream that suits your tastes . The clean interface is attractive and ad-free , but Google needs to add new features quickly before the full rollout . Here are ten we want . 1 . Improve Circles Circles is a brilliant idea - Google obviously picked the one feature in Facebook that has never worked right . You can post messages to select groups , but Facebook still maintains a general feed for your profile . Anyone you have friended can see your profile . With Google+ , you can select who sees the content you post . Still , it is a bit simplistic . We 'd like to see sub-categories under each Circle and a better way to add users en masse , especially from one entire account like Twitter . 2 . Analytics dashboard For a company that practically invented analytics ( with Google Analytics ) , we 're surprised there are few reporting features . You ca n't see a daily summary of new ( and lost ) followers , and there is no scorecard that shows whether other users are re-posting your content and commenting - it needs something like SproutSocial ( below ) . A daily snapshot would help motivate new users to engage with the service more . And , a feature that even shows whether people are clicking on your links , similar to the Bit.ly link-shortener , would also help add some value that Facebook lacks . 3. iPhone/iPad app Anyone with an Android smartphone can download the Google+ app , but that leaves out iPhone and BlackBerry users . The iPhone app would be particularly useful for those who rely on a contacts database on the road - with Google+ , it would be easy to find new colleagues and chat with co-workers , or even find new business customers . We 'd also welcome a tablet version where you can drag contacts into Circles and chat over the built-in camera . This is reported to be imminent , so we 'll see . 4 . Search by interest and occupation Right now , Google+ only lets you search for other users by name . That 's disappointing , given that Google is the biggest name in search . We 'd like to see a way to search for people with common interests , or even who work in the same field . There are few features for searching by location , and you ca n't even find former classmates or colleagues . 5 . Better Twitter integration The Extended Share for Google Plus extension for Chrome lets you send your posts to Twitter and Facebook , but we want a feature that works the other way , Google+ is the new kid on the block . For those who post on Twitter exclusively , and then feed those posts to other services and a blog , we want to the ability to send posts to Google+ as the service ramps up and more people start signing up over the next few months . 6 . Facebook import Speaking of better integration , we 'd also like to see an `` import from Facebook '' feature . Facebook closes their data from the world - you ca n't export all of your photos , for example . Tools like Facebook Friend Exporter could have solved the problem , but Facebook has blocked the tool . A workaround is to import all of your contacts to Yahoo Mail , then import the Yahoo contact into Google+ . Ca n't we all just get along ? Google should be able to make a Facebook Connect feature to bring in your friends from the competing service using OAuth . 7 . Block Inappropriate content You can post a rude picture on Google+ without any warning . That 's a sign of an early beta . Google told us that explicit content can be flagged , but Facebook does a much better job of analysing images and blocking those that would be offensive . Google has an image recognition tech baked inside Google Search ; they need to get those engineers in the same room . 8 . More control over public data Google+ is a more public social network than Facebook , and that is a good thing . The indexes are fully searchable from Google.com . Yet , we 'd like a way to control that . You might decide to create an account for your business and post publicly to other users , but would prefer that your posts were not searchable . Privacy is a bit weak overall ; the service has a few bugs related to blocking users ( the blocking does not work at first ) that need to be ironed out . 9 . Errant message warning The ability to post messages to a select few is a welcome feature . We like the interface for posting a message to just a couple of friends , and it works like a direct message in Twitter . You can also post content to select groups . However , it is too easy to send an errant message . For example , if you type a private message and forget to remove the `` public : circle , Google+ does not warn you at all . Either private messages need to be separated out or there needs to be an opportunity to verify the people who will see your message are the ones you wanted . 10 . More interface options Surprisingly , Google+ offers no options at all for changing the interface -- you ca n't change colour schemes , use more than one column for your feed , and even add widgets . This is an early stage , and we 're not wishing that Google+ follow in the MySpace footsteps with highly customized pages , but some UI flexibility would help . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -

Facebook users will soon be able to call any phone in the world via the social networking site using the built-in Skype service announced on Wednesday . The news was confirmed by Skype 's consumer boss Neil Stevens as the next thing planned for the partnership between two of the world 's most recognisable tech names . If one of your Facebook friends is online and has their phone number listed , you 'll be able to call their handset in the same way that you would initiate a text chat . Just like when using your regular Skype app , voice calls to mobile phones will be charged , but it is not yet clear whether members can use Facebook or Skype credit for the service . Google Voice-beater The revelation is n't exactly ground-breaking as Skype has been offering this service forever , and Google Voice offers cheap international calls through the web browser and smartphone apps . However , according to Business Insider , users will also be able to make inter-client calls between Facebook and Skype in the future . Facebook engineer , Philip Su , who worked on the video chat feature , told the publication that Facebook-to-Skype calls would be the next logical step for the partnership . Earlier on Wednesday Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the link-up between the two companies , which will allow users to video chat using the social networking site . Source : Business Insider
Facebook has announced two new services that brings more sharing to the social network - group chat and video calling , After much rumour and speculation , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage today at a Facebook event which was live-streamed on the site . Speaking at the event , Zuckerberg said : `` We 've been busy building stuff for the past six months or so – today marks what we are calling launching season 2011 . '' The new things that are being launched is the ability to group chat ad hoc on the service and also the addition of video calling , with a little help from Skype . There has also been a makeover of the chat window , so that it is easier to speak to multiple people . Zuckerberg 's speech was mainly about the power of sharing on the social network and how this is the biggest driver of traffic on the site . `` Social networking is at an inflection point right now . The narrative has always been about connecting people , '' said Zuckerberg . `` The amount of stuff that is shared today is twice what it was a year ago . That kind of exponential growth is profound . The thing that is growing faster than people on Facebook is the amount of sharing on Facebook . '' `` If you look at how sharing is growing , then you can plot this out in the future . So , if this is what people are sharing now then what apps do we have to create to encompass this in the next few years . '' Facebook is hoping that group chat and video calling will allow this , but it is not doing this on its own . Facebook 's video chat is using Skype - something that was widely rumoured . This is the big difference between what Facebook is doing compared to other internet companies , according to Zuckerberg - which was more than a sly dig at Google who recently announced its own video chat , as part of Google+ . In his keynote , he said : `` Working with Skype underlines our approach with how we are building this stuff . We want to leave these types of apps to those who are best in class in creating these things . `` This is a big difference from other internet companies who try and to millions of things on their own . '' Zuckerberg confirmed that the video chat would be a plug-in that would have to be downloaded . Tony Bates , CEO of Skype , said about the link-up between Facebook and Skype : `` We think this makes a lot of business sense , we have a shared vision of what communication to mean and there is no finer platform to stick your technology on top . '' If you want to try out video calling on Facebook , then go to www.facebook.com/videocalling now - the service is available from today and is fully integrated into Facebook Chat .

Facebook is set announce in-browser video chat for the social network this week and there are reports that this service will be powered by Skype . The ink is yet to dry on Microsoft 's buyout of Skype but it seems that one of its first partnerships under Ballmer and Co 's tutelage will be with Facebook – if a TechCrunch source is correct . This is n't the first time that Skype has been linked to Facebook . Back in September 2010 the same rumour reared its head and this March it was reported that talks had resumed between the two companies . Who wants to FaceSkype ? Facebook has been linked with video chat as far back as 2009 , when it was noted that it was trialling a service that would rival Skype . Facebook is definitely launching a new service 6 July , with an invite going out to US press . The image on the invite is pretty apparent that some sort of video integration is incoming . It 's easy to see why Facebook would want to integrate video chat . The launch of Google+ last week to a select few individuals showed that Google was using video chat as a main part of its social network – allowing group video chat for those who want to Hangout .

Facebook is planning an assault on the mobile market next week , with the social network announcing it is about to `` launch something awesome '' . Facebook is currently working on a new app optimised for iPad but it is also said to be working on another mobile product which is photo sharing for the iPhone . All we know about the apparent product launch is that CEO Mark Zuckerberg told journalists that the Seattle office was the place where mobile developments were taking place and that next week 's launch would be `` awesome '' . Social mobile It 's no surprise that Facebook is looking closely at its mobile offering . Google has just launch its own social network , with Google+ , and it has been designed to work as a seamless mobile experience . Despite the popularity of Facebook , its mobile output has been quaint at best , with both its iPhone and Android apps still lacking in some functionality . Facebook for the iPad should hopefully bring the company up to speed with the mobile world .

Facebook has announced that it is leaving its Facebook Deals product behind after a four-month testing period . Although the product never made it over to our fair shores , it was hyped up to be one of Groupon 's biggest competitors by offering its 750 million active users daily group deals . `` After testing Deals for four months , we 've decided to end our Deals product in the coming weeks , '' says Facebook 's statement , sent to TechRadar . `` We think there is a lot of power in a social approach to driving people into local businesses . We remain committed to building products to help local businesses connect with people , like Ads , Pages , Sponsored Stories , and Check-in Deals . `` We 've learned a lot from our test and we 'll continue to evaluate how to best serve local businesses . '' Although the official Deals product is over , Facebook will still be offering Check-In Deals , through which businesses can offer vouchers and offers to users who check in to Facebook from their premises . The demise of Facebook Deals comes just days after the social network put the kibosh on Facebook Places , a FourSquare-alike service that pinpointed users locations and shared it with their friends . Is the social networking site having a clear out to make space for exciting new services like the music-focused Facebook Vibes ? With F8 set for 22 September , it should n't be long until we find out what 's next for the big white F .

Facebook hit one trillion page views in June 2011 , according to Google-owned ad network Double-click . That means pages on the social network were viewed a hell of a lot by the 870,000,000 unique users that visited Facebook in the same month . To explain , every time you click on anything in Facebook you 're contributing a page view - so flicking through photo galleries , liking pages , visiting friends ' profiles are all classed as page views . Each time you did any of those things in June you contributed to that trillion figure . It 's also ten-times as many page views as the next most-viewed site , YouTube , managed in the same month - it 's worth bearing in mind that these figures are estimated but as a 'by Google ' service , we 're inclined to trust doubleclick 's judgement . Elsewhere in the land of Facebook , the social network could be looking to introduce its own photo filters to its mobile app . Apps like Hipstamatic and Instagram have proven hugely popular with users desperate to give their blurry smartphone shots a vintage look . The New York Times reports that `` Facebook will introduce almost a dozen photo filters , including some that are similar to Instagram like old-style camera lenses and grainy film . `` Facebook will also try to introduce new styles of filters with the hopes of drawing users away from other photo apps . '' According to the same report , Facebook recently tried and failed to acquire Instagram , leading the Zuckerberg-led network to try its own hand at the social photo sharing game .

There are two ways of looking at Facebook 's sudden love of sensible privacy settings : it 's either a cynical response to German privacy regulators , or it 's a cynical response to Google+ . Either one 's fine by me . I 'm quick to criticise Facebook , so credit where credit 's due : the new privacy settings go a long way to addressing some of the more irritating aspects of the service . No more will friends be able to pollute your profile with shots where you look like a fat horse , or status updates that make you look stupid . Now , you 'll see what you 've been tagged in before it turns up on your profile - and if you do n't like it , you can veto it . Best of all , no more will you have to wander through Facebook 's labyrinthine privacy settings to find out what information you 're sharing with stalkers , exes and identity thieves . You can change privacy settings on a per-post basis , letting everyone see this , colleagues that and friends that without having to fiddle with global settings , and there 's a one-click way to see what your profile looks like to different groups of people . It 's all very Google+ , and that 's no accident - but it 's not just a victory for Google . It 's a victory for whingeing and moaning too . Facebook often comes across as distant and arrogant , possibly because it 's distant and arrogant . It 's been particularly unfriendly over privacy , largely because it 's the only game in town . `` Do n't like our privacy policy ? '' Facebook cackles . `` Have fun on MySpace ! '' From time to time it 'll backtrack - so for example it 's currently in a spat with German privacy regulators who argue it breaks data protection regulations , and it 'll no doubt make a few changes because of that - but the attitude is typically that of a surly teenager who 's been ordered to tidy his or her room . Whenever there 's a privacy scare Facebook does the bare minimum it can get away with , and when it thinks nobody 's looking the privacy fiddling starts all over again . That means Facebook has become the service many of us love to hate : we spend more time fiddling with privacy settings than we do posting , but we ca n't leave because all our friends are there . However , while Facebook might not care about our moaning , Google does . Google cares a lot . It turns out that all our moaning has n't been entirely wasted , because Google realised that it represented a chink in Facebook 's armour . `` Hmmm , '' said Google . `` If we built something a bit Facebook-y , but added proper privacy protection , we could be awesome ! '' And that 's exactly what Google did , attracting more than ten million users in a matter of weeks . That 's a drop in the ocean compared to Facebook 's hundreds of millions , but it 's enough to make Zuckerberg take notice - and to persuade Facebook to make the biggest changes to its privacy settings we 've seen in years . The moral is clear . If you ca n't beat 'em , moan about 'em . You never know who 's listening . Updated to clarify the new tagging features , which I 'd described incorrectly : when you 're tagged you can stop the item from appearing on your profile , but it does n't prevent a photo or update from appearing elsewhere on Facebook . For that , you need to click on the post and select Remove Tag .

Facebook has announced a large-scale overhaul of its privacy settings to give users more control over who sees the items posted to their profile . The changes , which will start appearing to users on Thursday , gives each post on your wall its own unique privacy setting , whether it was added by yourself or another user . The headline feature , of over a dozen adjustments , is the ability to approve photo and status tags before they appear on your profile . Facebook says it was the most requested addition and will prevent embarrassing tags from friends appearing before you have the chance to veto . Also , when you update your own status or post a link or a photo you can choose exactly who you share each item with , be it friends , the public or a custom setting . Another improvement gives Facebook users the opportunity to tag a location on the full site as well as the smartphone apps . As well as the ability to approve or reject tags before they appear on your profile , you 'll also have the opportunity to tag non-friends in photos and posts . The final top-line change is the new Profile View setting , which allows you to see , for the first time , your own page as your friends see it . The additions put more privacy controls right at your fingertips rather than having to trawl through the sea of account settings .

Miramax is set to become the latest film studio to flog its blockbusters on Facebook , with a movie rental app to land on the social network later today . You 'll even be able to watch the movies on an iPad through a browser-based player , with Miramax suggesting that a stand alone iPad app could also be on the cards . Miramax eXperience will land with 10 films available to rent throughout September , each costing 30 Facebook credits in the UK and Turkey . Those lucky blighters in the US will have 20 titles to choose between , but we 're just happy that the UK is getting a first bite of the cherry ; France and Germany are next on the eXperience ( groan ) hit list . We 'll be able to watch Chicago , Cold Mountain , Good Will Hunting and that modern-day classic Spy Kids on Facebook in the UK , among others . We 're denied the additional bonus of US-only classics like No Country for Old Men and Pulp Fiction due to rights issues . Other film studios have also tried using Facebook for film rentals . For example , Warner Bros released The Dark Knight on the social networking site as a one off earlier this year . But Miramax is playing the long game and exploiting Facebook 's access to 750 million active consumers as an ongoing project : `` We wanted to fish where the fish are . We could have created the most robust Miramax.com in the world and other than my family members , who would be there ? '' explained Miramax CEO Mike Lang in an interview with PaidContent . As well as movie-watching , the Miramax eXperience offers a social gaming element whereby users can cast their Facebook friends in various Miramax movies , unlocking bonus content as they play . It 'll be interesting to see if Facebook can begin luring users away from established VOD sites like LoveFilm – but with such a limited catalogue to be getting on with , we suspect not .

Facebook has started to roll a new feature called Ticker , which will showcase all updates in real-time . The new functionality will feature status updates , likes , photo postings and what-not as they happen . Ticker will not replace the current news feed , but instead will appear to the right of it . Facebook 's news feed will increasingly focus on `` Highlights '' or top stories , according to the All Facebook blog , but that is likely to mean a lot of repetition across the page . So far only a few users have seen the update affect their homepage landscape , but it is believed that all users are in line for the switch . The new ticker also boasts a new means of commenting on and liking posts . As you mouse over an item it will spread across the main news feed and allow you to respond . Link : All Facebook

The opening game of the FA Cup is to be streamed live on Facebook , after the social network struck a deal with the Football Association . The match will be the first ever to be broadcast on Facebook as Ascot United and Wembley FC kick off the tournament . Although this means you wo n't be seeing Premier League calibre players perform , it 's great news for both teams as the potential audience for the game is massive . The game will be shown on Budweiser 's Facebook page and will be accessible through an app built by the beer company . Speaking about the event , Iain Newell , Marketing Director , Budweiser UK , said : `` As a long-standing supporter of football globally , Budweiser is committed to bringing the world 's most prestigious knockout competition closer to the fans . What better way to demonstrate this than by broadcasting the very first kick to a global audience via Facebook . `` This is the first time a FA Cup tournament fixture has been broadcast live on the social network , which is great news for football fans and clubs alike . '' There is an age restriction on the stream , though – you have to be of legal drinking age . Unfortunately , this does n't mean that Budweiser will be offering free beer to go with the footie . Facebook has been ramping up its live coverage of events recently , as well as offering things such as movies to watch through the social network . Live streaming coverage of the game will begin on Facebook Friday 19 August at 7.30pm .
Facebook has spoken out about Google+ and its new gaming service , revealing that it is pushing itself to be better than the search giant . It 's no surprise that Google waded into the gaming sector with Google+ . While it may look like a similar service to Facebook 's on the surface , the big kicker for devs is that Google is only taking 5 per cent revenue from the games ; Facebook on the other hand nabs 15 per cent . Facebook director of game partnerships Sean Ryan spoke about the revenue difference and made a rather cutting but key remark . `` Google is at 5 per cent because they do n't have any users , '' he noted at a recent event . Ryan also revealed that Facebook is keeping a close eye on Google+ , and that it is searching for ways to improve its own gaming service . `` Google has emulated aspects of our system , which is what they have the right to do , '' he explained . `` We just need to be better . '' After the announcement by Google that it was adding games to Google+ , Facebook hit back immediately with improvements of its own , including more screen real estate for gaming and a tickertape of information telling you what friends are playing what games . This was a decent riposte , but the social network will be hoping that with the next announcement it wo n't be playing catch-up .

Facebook has presented evidence that it describes as a `` smoking gun '' in the ownership case filed by Paul Ceglia . Lawyers for the social network have filed a document saying that a contract submitted by Ceglia as evidence in his ownership claim was actually a doctored version of another contract . Having claimed that he bought an 84 per cent stake in Facebook before it became the multi-million dollar business it is today , Ceglia produced the agreement in question which was signed by both him and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg . The contract appeared to show Zuckerberg agreeing to build a website called `` The Face Book '' or `` The Page Book '' . However , Facebook says that forensic testing has revealed that this contract actually relates to a website called StreetFax and makes no mention of Facebook at all . `` The court-ordered forensic testing has uncovered the authentic contract between Mark Zuckerberg and StreetFax that Ceglia attempted to conceal , '' the Facebook filing said . `` This smoking-gun evidence confirms what Defendants have said all along : the purported contract attached to the complaint is an outright fabrication . `` The authentic contract - which mentions only StreetFax and has nothing to do with Facebook - was found embedded in the electronic data from 2004 on Ceglia 's computer . '' In July of this year , Ceglia 's lawyers - they of the `` we did weeks of due diligence to validate his evidence '' claims - became the fourth firm to ditch him and his foundering court case . Facebook is now looking to the court for a dismissal of the case based on `` the now-overwhelming evidence of Ceglia 's fraud , spoliation and subterfuge . ''

Facebook has revealed that it has bolstered its gaming service , after Google announced it has also begun offering games through its social network , Google+ . Facebook has had massive success with the gaming part of the site . Companies such as Zynga has used Facebook to make their billions . At one point , Zynga 's FarmVille was said to have more people on it than use Twitter . Google has also dabbled in in-browser gaming but it only announced the first lot of games to hit Google+ this week . These include Angry Birds and Zynga Poker . Let the games begin In a blog , which coincided with the Google+ Games launch , Facebook said : `` When you 're playing games , you 'll now see a separate stream of your friends ' game activity , scores and achievements in a ticker . `` The best way to find new games is through friends , and now you 'll have more opportunities to see what they 're playing . `` Maybe your best friend has started playing Sims ; your roommate has a new high score on PacMan ; or your mom and sister have taken up Words With Friends . Simply click on a story and you can start playing the game yourself . '' It also noted that it had added a bigger screen and you can now bookmark your favourite games to play later . These additions are more tweaks than major overhauls but the timing of them is significant . Facebook sees Google+ as a rival and it seems that with the search engine 's games announcement one of the people .

Facebook 's just-released Messenger app has been hiding a video-calling feature in its code . It looks as though you 'll be able to video call on both Android and iOS , and there 's speculation that the feature will use Skype to power it , just as the video calling feature on the web version of Facebook does . The app , which has only been released in the US for now , was announced as a text messaging service that , like BlackBerry Messenger , delivers your messages within a closed network . It 's not the first time that scouring Facebook app code has brought up future features ; just a couple of weeks ago an eagle eyed developer discovered the entire Facebook for iPad app hidden inside the code for the existing iPhone app . There has n't been an official release for the iPad app just yet , but it 's likely to be imminent . As for video conferencing within the Facebook Messenger app ? Seems to be a given but who knows exactly when it 'll be launched as a fully-fledged feature ; at this point , we 'd be happy just to see basic Facebook Messenger land in the UK .
Some members of Anonymous have announced their intention to 'kill Facebook ' on 5 November . Taking the monologue-ing Bond villain approach , those planning the attack have released a video explaining their motives as well as revealing the Fireworks Night date . `` Join the cause and kill Facebook for the sake of your own privacy , '' the video statement says . It goes on to claim that , `` Facebook has been selling information to government agencies and giving clandestine access to information security firms so that they can spy on people from all around the world . `` Facebook is the opposite of the anti-sec cause . Prepare for a day that will go down in history . '' However , not all of the collective appear to be behind Operation Facebook ; the official Anonymous Twitter account followed the launch of the latest mission by tweeting , `` # OpFacebook is being organised by some Anons . This does not necessarily mean that all of # Anonymous agrees with it . '' So , it 's a case of remember , remember the fifth of November – or , since it 's a Saturday , go out and enjoy the fireworks and later on remember that some hacking collective said something about it three months ago and give Facebook a cursory check to see if it 's down . Here 's Operation Facebook 's full video statement - what do you think of its motives ? And do you think hacktivism is a legitimate form of protest ? Let us know in the comments below . Via Mashable

Facebook has introduced a new Messenger app for iPhone and Android aimed at making sure your friends receive your correspondence with greater speed . The new Messenger app , which will rival BlackBerry Messenger and Apple 's forthcoming iMessage service , exists separately from the main Facebook app . Messenger will allow users to contact both Facebook friends and phone contacts with the recipient receiving notifications and texts to inform them of your message . Facebook thinks the service , which is yet to arrive on either platform 's app store , will mean friends will see your messages sooner . In a post on the company blog , Facebook engineer Lucy Zhang wrote : `` It is n't always easy to know the best way to reach someone on their phone . `` Should you send an email or text ? Which will they check first ? Did they even get your last message ? `` We think messaging should be easier than that . You should be able to write a message , click `` Send '' and know that you will reach the person right away . `` So today , we 're introducing Messenger , a new mobile app that simplifies how messaging works , and gives you a faster way to message friends and small groups . '' Facebook reckons the new solution will be perfect for users who are arranging to meet a group of friends and need to contact the group at short notice . `` When you 're on the go , coordinating a bunch of people can be tricky , especially if plans change at the last minute . With Messenger , you can quickly start a group conversation and message everyone at once . `` If you choose to add your location , the people you 're messaging with can easily find each other on the map . You can also attach photos , so everyone else can see and comment on what you 're looking at . '' Facebook 's service will have an instant advantage over BBM , iMessage and Google 's Gtalk , thanks to its multi-platform compatibility . Users will be able to exchange free messages regardless of their mobile operating system .

Sanford Wallace faces up to 16 years in jail , if found guilty of a number of phishing attacks on half a million unsuspecting Facebook users . Wallace is alleged to have sent 27 million spam messages from hacked Facebook accounts back in 2008 and 2009 . He has now been indicted by a California court on three counts of intentional damage to a protected computer and two counts of criminal contempt . Wallace is said to have compromised around 500,000 Facebook accounts during three separate attacks between November 2008 and March 2009 . If convicted of all the current charges , this self-described spam king could well be looking at a 40 year stretch in prison , as well as fines in excess of $ 2 million . Wallace 's notorious CyberPromotions was responsible for spamming around 30 million junk e-mails every day back in the 1990s . Despite being ordered to not access Facebook by a US District Court Judge back in 2009 , Wallace is also charged with violating that order by accessing the social network under the pseudoymn David Sinful-Saturdays Fredericks earlier this year .

Facebook 's marketing director Randi Zuckerberg has left the social networking giant to start her own media company . Zuckerberg , sister of Facebook founder and CEO Mark , will form a company called RtoZ media , which is aimed at helping media companies improve the social side of their business . In her resignation letter , revealed by the AllThingsD website , Randi says she poured her heart into the company , but it is time to move on to continue the work started by Facebook , outside of the company . The letter reads : `` I have spent my years at Facebook pouring my heart and soul into innovating and pushing the media industry forward by introducing new concepts around live , social , participatory viewing that the media industry has since adopted . `` We have made incredible progress , but there is still much to be done and other ways I can affect change . `` Now is the perfect time for me to move outside of Facebook to build a company focused on the exciting trends underway in the media industry . '' Facebook has confirmed the resignation , but so far there has been no comment from Mark Zuckerberg personally on the departure of his sister . Randi had been with Facebook since the very early days , and joined in 2004 . She had recently been nominated for an Emmy award for her work on the Facebook Live video streaming service .

Germany has officially declared Facebook 's controversial auto-facial recognition feature illegal and given the site two weeks to remove it . The feature , which makes it easier for people to tag pictures of their friends through automatically suggesting their identity , has caused a storm since it was announced in Europe in June . Tag suggestions keeps track of what faces are tagged with which names so that next time you upload photos it can begin offering you time-saving suggestions as to who is in them . Authorities across Europe , including the UK and Ireland , are probing the legality new feature - which has been in use in America since December - but the Germans are the first to declare it illegal . Johannes Caspar , a data protection official in Hamburg , claims says that the data Facebook is gathering by using this technology is threatening the anonymity of its users . `` The right to anonymity is in danger , '' he told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper `` If the data were to get into the wrong hands , then someone with a picture taken on a mobile phone could use biometrics to compare the pictures and make an identification , '' he added . `` We have repeatedly asked Facebook to shut down the facial recognition function and to delete the previously stored data , '' he also said in a statement on Tuesday . Facebook , which has provided users with a simple opt-out for tag suggestions , now has two weeks to respond to the ruling or face a fine of $ 500,000 . So far it is steadfast in its assertion that the feature is n't breaking any data protection laws . A spokesperson for the company said the site `` firmly rejected any accusations that we are not complying with our obligations to European Union data protection laws . '' That statement overlooks Germany 's own extremely strict privacy laws , which were put in place following the abuses carried out by the Nazis . It 'll be interesting to see how Germany vs Facebook will play out here . Maybe Mark Zuckerberg is still annoyed that Angela Merkel told him she enjoyed The Social Network ? Via : The Atlantic Wire
Facebook has added the option for expectant parents to inform their social circle of the good news via a new status update . The `` Expected : Child '' update can be added to the profile via the Friends & Family tab within Facebook 's edit profile section . Would-be parents can also add the baby 's due date and what they plan to name the new delivery . The unborn baby appears then on the user 's profile next to other specified friends and family members on Facebook . While this is potentially a nice way for expecting couples to share the news with the people they do n't know or like enough to inform in person , it does have its pitfalls . Most of us would surely consider adding such an update to be tempting fate ? Many people experience the hurt of sharing the dreaded `` is now single '' news on Facebook , but the heartbreak of having to remove such a post in the event of a miscarriage does n't bear thinking about . Add that to the fact that the new baby would now be on Facebook before he or she is even born certainly brings a few ethical issues into play also . via PCMag

Oxford University academic and professor of pharmacology Baroness Greenfield suggests that spending too much time on the internet checking email , Facebook , Twitter , RSS news feeds and all the rest is destroying our very sense of who we are . She argues that our modern obsession with always-on connections , social networking and real-time news threatens our own understandings of our own minds and personalities . Twitter and Facebook 'identity crisis ' It is the banality of Twitter that Baroness Greenfield seems to be mostly concerned about , claiming that our focus on the instant and continuous feedback from our internet friends is rewiring humans ' brains in a fundamental way . Baroness Greenfield said : 'Why should someone be interested in what someone else had for breakfast ? It reminds me of a small child ( saying ) : `` Look at me Mummy , I 'm doing this , look at me Mummy , I 'm doing that . `` It 's almost as if they 're in some kind of identity crisis . In a sense it 's keeping the brain in a sort of time warp . `` It 's almost as if people are living in a world that 's not a real world , but a world where what counts is what people think of you or ( if they ) can click on you . Think of the implications for society if people worry more about what other people think about them than what they think about themselves . ''

It can be a tricky balance , keeping your Facebook community on side , but Nikon USA appears to have fallen foul of several users after a particular post has causen uproar . Normally , any brand would be delighted to see such engagement from a single post , at last count it had been shared 1,072 times , commented on 2,703 times and `` liked '' 1,618 times by a community of over 840,000 likers . But it would appear that the majority of those commenting and sharing were not happy with what the post said . It read : `` A photographer is only as good as the equipment he uses , and a good lens is essential to taking good pictures ! '' before asking users to share their favourite Nikkor lenses . This caused a sensation as Nikon was lambasted for suggesting that it was equipment which produced good photographs , and not the skill of the photographer involved . Since then , users were met with stony silence after the news began to spread about the post across the internet . This afternoon , a fresh post apologising for the previous status was posted . `` We know some of you took offence to the last post , and we apologise , as it was not our aim to insult any of our friends . Our statement was meant to be interpreted that the right equiupment can help you capture amazing images , '' the post read . The incident serves as a warning to other manufacturers about getting it right when it comes to social media . Nikon 's major rival Canon has a Facebook page with over 500,000 fans but leaves it up to the community to make posts , failing to make a single post on the page since it has launched .
Spotify has responded to widespread complaints from its user base that they did not want everything they listened to published to Facebook by bringing in a 'private listening ' option . Spotify has often reacted quickly to user feedback , and after many disconnected their accounts soon after adding them into Facebook because they did not want their every musical whim broadcast to their friends and family , the music streaming company has made changes . `` Now you can temporarily hide your guilty pleasures , '' read the tweet . `` We call it `` Private listening '' and you can find it in the Spotify/File menu . '' The news was announced on Spotify 's Twitter account , and was greeted with immediate pleasure by followers . Spotify 's partnership with Facebook was announced at the F8 conference , which focused heavily on the integration of music and playlists into the social network . Founder Daniel Ek was invited to the stage to showcase Spotify on Facebook , illustrating the growing sway of the music streaming service which was founded in Sweden and launched in 2008 .

The latest stats in from Experian Hitwise show that British internet users are spending an average of 25 minutes and 33 seconds on Facebook each time they log in . At least , that was the average over the course of August 2011 – and is a good 13 minutes under the amount of Facebooking time the Singaporeans get in . Singapore topped the chart of the eight countries analysed , with its Facebook users clocking up 38 minutes and 46 seconds a go . Next in line to the Facebook time-wasting crown is New Zealand , with 30 miunutes and 31 seconds , followed by Australia , the UK , the US , France , India and Brazil . Facebook , for its part , is hoping to increase the amount of time users spend on the network by bringing in more and more media options , including movie rentals and music service tie-ins . The company has n't introduced these features out of the good of its heart , of course : the longer you spend on Facebook , the more ads you see . The more ads you see , the more money the company can rake in . Hitwise focused on the eight countries it currently operates in to formulate the chart . It also examined how much 'market share ' social networks have in terms of each country 's website visits and found that the UK 's is the lowest of the bunch . Social networks and forums take just 12.2 per cent of the UK 's online market share , compared to 18.9 per cent in Brazil , which topped the chart . Ankur Shah , CEO and co-founder of Experian-owned Techlightenment , said of the results : `` Our research shows that the way individuals use social media can and does change according to cultural and personal backgrounds .

Facebook has finally announced a link up with Spotify , offering up most of its functionality within the social network . The idea is that it will make listening to music more social and improves on the Connect features that were released before . This is done in three ways within Facebook : the first is the real-time ticker on the right-hand side of your homepage . This will give you a constant update of what people are listening to . The second part is within your main feed . Here you will get highly relevant stories about the music people like . Music will only appear here if you have some friends that are also listening to the same tune - this means that Facebook is essentially curating a best-of music feed for you . The final element of this is the music dashboard . Here you can see what everyone is listening to and has listened to on your network . This is a massive list of music in one place ; albums that are trending in your network and finally a long feed of what your friends have been listening to . The first thing you need to know about the service is that for Spotify on Facebook to work , you need to have a Spotify account already . This is n't a major problem , however , as the two companies have made it easier than ever to sign up to the service . If you are a user who does n't have Spotify , you will still get bits of news feed telling you what your friends are listening to . Once you click one of these messages you will be asked whether you want to download the Spotify client or not . Click okay and this will then download Spotify on to your computer and instantly create an account for you using your Facebook account credentials . A prompt also appears if you do n't have Spotify open , this just asks you if you want to open the Spotify client . Click okay and you are away . As this integration is all about being social , the more you put into the service the more you will get out of it . If you allow Facebook to aggregate what you listen to on Spotify , then this should cause a domino effect within your friend group . When you click on a track one of your friends are listening to , what comes up is an image of the album the track is from and a big play button , all you have to do is click on this and it will start playing the song . While you are doing this through Facebook , what is actually happening is Spotify is running in the background – you can even flick between Facebook and Spotify to see this happening . So it is not streaming through the Facebook page , rather Spotify is 'talking ' to its Facebook client . The reason it has been done this way is actually quite sound . Essentially , if you move away from Facebook , then the music will still play – this means that you get the same experience that you do at the moment with Spotify . With this in mind , the integration with Spotify is pretty seamless . You can even pause and play the track you are listening to with your keyboard . And it does n't just work on single tracks , either – if you click on someone 's playlist , then this will be saved onto your Spotify account . At the moment , there 's one feature yet to launch that will make the service even more social . This is called Listen Along and will be launched in the UK and US first , but quite when we do not know . This will allow you to listen in 'live ' to what any of your friends are listening to , even if the track is playing halfway through . It works in much the same way as clicking on a friend 's music link at the moment , except when you hover over it you will be asked if you want to listen in live . This could be a massive thing for Facebook , as you can become a DJ for your friends , with any number of them listening into what you are playing – there could definitely be some commercial interest in this from DJs around the world as well . When this becomes integrated it will also come with its own chat service , so a chat pop up will appear and you can talk among your friends . Spotify has had to be clever with its algorithms to make sure its service is seen as global on Facebook . This does mean that there will be some song matching going on . This will happen if you are trying to listen to a friend 's music who is living oversees and there 's no rights for this track in your country . Spotify will try and best match it but if it ca n't , and we are told this is rare , then a pop-up will appear saying you ca n't listen to the track . At the moment , the discovery of new music can only be done through your friends . If you do want to listen to your favourite band 's music through Facebook , however , you can do so by searching for their fan page and you will find a list of their most played tunes on Spotify . We would like to see a more pro-active search approach for the service but at the moment , Spotify on Facebook works and it works well – as long as you are in sync with your friend 's music collection that is . Spotify on Facebook is set to roll out globally over the next few days .
Poor Google . It gives its Google+ social networking service some welcome tweaks , opens it up to the public , and nobody pays the slightest bit of attention . This week , all eyes were on Facebook - and not just because founder Mark Zuckerberg is now worth more money than Google 's founders . Facebook is thinking big , and this week we discovered just how big its plans are . Facebook 's annual conference tends to involve some tweaks to the globe-gobbling social network , but this year is much more dramatic : Facebook has effectively been rebooted , with some features that will warm the hearts of oversharers everywhere . When the redesign reaches you in a few weeks ' time , Facebook wo n't just be about what you 're doing now ; it 'll be about everything you 've ever done . The heart of the new Facebook is the Timeline , a new , more visual kind of profile that will appear on desktop and mobile versions of the site . It 's better seen than described , so we 've put together an extensive photo gallery for your excitement and delightment . The Timeline is n't just a pretty face . It 's a new focus for Facebook activity . As Marc Chacksfield explains : `` Instead of being a realtime feed of events , Zuckerberg and co have created a past-time feed of your entire ( Facebook ) life , with the feature replacing everyone 's profile page ... To make the Timeline work , a new class of apps have been created . These 'personal ' apps allow for you to express yourself in new ways , according to Facebook . '' Personal apps go much further than anything you 've seen on Facebook before . For example , Spotify integration means that Facebook now has a music app . As Dan Grabham points out , Spotify is n't the only big name making Facebook apps : `` other names on board with these new apps include The Guardian , The Independent , Netflix ( not UK ) and Nike Plus . '' The key to Spotify , and to the other apps , is sharing . `` You 'll now start seeing new music posts and play buttons in your newsfeed , '' Grabham explains , `` while your friends will be able to see what you 're listening to - providing you give Facebook permission of course . '' So how will the other apps work ? According to Mark Zuckerberg , `` you can fill out your Timeline with your favourite activities using apps and websites , and create a live connection to them so they 're updated as you go . For example photographers can fill their Timeline with photo apps that will update with each new photo taken ; cooks can add recipe apps that will update with each new dish made ; and music fans can connect to apps that show their top playlists . '' Depending on the apps you install , your Timeline will update when you buy a concert ticket , read a news article , listen to a song , watch a film or make dinner . Not everyone is impressed . Resident grouch Gary Marshall for one is faintly frightened by it all . `` Remember when we used to worry about Google storing search data ? That 's a drop in the ocean compared to what Facebook 's trying to do , '' he says . `` The new Facebook does n't just want you to post your life on Facebook , but to actually live your life within Facebook 's comforting embrace . '' As Marshall points out , there are practical concerns - `` what are you going to do about your Timeline if you get divorced ? What happens if Facebook cocks up and deletes your account ? '' - but for him , the real worry is that Facebook is essentially creating a second internet , a service that brings you nice things but that `` monitors everything you do , and which is owned by a faraway , unaccountable private company with a long track record of messing with its users ' privacy . '' Marshall , it 's safe to say , is n't on Mark Zuckerberg 's Facebook friends list . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Liked this ?

The rumour mill predicted that Facebook would launch something big this week , and for once it underestimated things : Facebook wants to own the entire internet - and it wants to own your entire life too . I 'm not exaggerating . From the cradle to the grave , Facebook would like you to share every thought , every song you listen to , every photograph you shoot and everything you read with some or all of your Facebook friends and subscribers . Remember the adage : if you ca n't see what product a site is selling , the product is you . That 's definitely the case with Facebook , whose entire business depends on mining the details of your life to better target ads for pointless crap you do n't need . In that context , Facebook urging you to share everything - everything - is chilling . Remember when we used to worry about Google storing search data ? That 's a drop in the ocean compared to what Facebook 's trying to do . It 's all very reminiscent of the Police song Every Breath You Take : like the song 's protagonist , Facebook will be watching every move you make , vow you break , smile you fake and claim you stake . Every Breath You Take is a popular wedding song because stacks of people miss its sinister subtext . Those people are going to love the new Facebook . When Facebook describes something as more social , it means less social : the new Facebook does n't just want you to post your life on Facebook , but to actually live your life within Facebook 's comforting embrace . Visiting The Guardian means leaving Facebook and seeing non-Facebook ads . Better , surely , for The Guardian to appear inside Facebook , surrounded by Facebook ads , generating data for Facebook 's ads to better target you in future . Better , surely , to have Facebook deliver your Spotify music , your Netflix movies , your everything else . What 's really going on here is that Facebook 's bringing Beacon back . In 2007 , we were appalled at the prospect of external sites telling Facebook what we 'd been up to so that it could better target its ads . Now , it seems , we 're delighted by exactly the same thing - but it 's OK this time because the external sites are inside Facebook now ! Yes , this time around you have to give the apps consent , but that 's a one-time job : will users really understand the implications of that , understand that a per-item Like has been replaced by a pre-emptive Like Everything ? There are practical concerns too . How do you get your stuff back out again if you decide you do n't want to keep it on Facebook ? Where will you take your stuff if Facebook 's cornered the market for photo sharing , video sharing and whatever-else sharing , driving rivals out of business ? What are you going to do about your Timeline if you get divorced ? What happens if Facebook cocks up and deletes your account ? Facebook is essentially building a second internet here , a service that offers many of the things you 'll find on the real internet but that closely monitors everything you do - and which is owned by a faraway , unaccountable private company with a long track record of messing with its users ' privacy . Does that worry you ? Because it scares the hell out of me .
As long rumoured , Facebook has announced that it is working with Spotify to offer music through the social network . But , as you 'll read , you 'll still need to have the Spotify app installed for it to work . The move was announced at Facebook 's F8 confrerence today Mark Zuckerberg announced `` two of the most exciting things we 've ever done '' . The first was Timeline , a more visual way to explore Facebook . Facebook has announced a number of changes to the site over the last few weeks , but the link up with Spotify is a big step for Zuckerberg 's army . The first hint that a link-up between Facebook and Spotify washappening came in August 2010 , when a revamp of the service offered deep Facebook integration.And when Spotify launched in the US it seemed like it was only a matter of time . Here 's what you need to know about the announcement : 1 . Facebook now has a Music app The service is n't offered through a specific Spotify app - instead you 'll now have a Music app in your Facebook profile sidebar . Spotify is a featured service within this . Spotify calls this page your Music Dashboard , though we 're not sure if that 's an official name or not . Speaking about the Spotify app , Daniel Ek from Spotify said : `` Finding new music is always difficult and that is why we created Spotify . `` We have spent the last few years building a service where you can find music . Add this to Facebook 's 800 million users and this will light up the world . '' 2 . It 's a new type of app Music is the first type of a new 'open ' app from Facebook ( called Open Graph ) - enabling any company to create an app that allows social interaction . Mark Zuckerberg said about the apps : `` The open graph is a completely new class of social apps to discover new things with your friends . '' Other names on board with these new apps are The Guardian , The Independent , Netflix ( not UK ) as well as Nike Plus . Other music services to have signed up include Deezer and SoundCloud . 3 . You can play music directly from your Facebook page ... You can click a play button from your Facebook newsfeed or Music Dashboard and the music will start . Though there 's a caveat ... 4 . ... but you 'll need to have Spotify open One thing that 's played down is that you 'll need to have Spotify open to play music . If it 's not open , you 'll see this message and Facebook will try and open it . And the Music you 're recommended wo n't necessarily be on Spotify - we 've already been recommended a Feeder album that 's not on the service . Now , it 's worth pointing out that this wo n't give you a total music experience through Facebook . It 's the social experience that you 're sharing , so you can listen to tracks your friends are but you ca n't search for just any old track through the Facebook interface . Think of it as another way to discover music with Spotify rather than a new interface to play music through . Here 's the permission screen you 'll see from within Spotify . 5 . Spotify on Facebook will be free `` We knew that the service had to be free to draw people away from piracy , '' continued Ek - but of course , you 'll still need to have a functioning Spotify app to use it . `` Helping them to listen to even more music . To do that , we also knew that the service would have to be inherently social . There could n't be a better place to do this than Facebook . `` This integration with Facebook will help everyone to discover more free music than ever before . Thanks to our unrivalled , truly free service , users can just hit play to enjoy the music , no hassle , no gimmicks ; month after month after month . '' 4 . You 'll see what your friends are listening to You 'll now start seeing new music posts and play buttons in your newsfeed , while your friends will be able to see what you 're listening to - providing you give Facebook permission of course . 7 . Spotify reckons that more people will buy music as a result `` We know that Spotify 's users who connect to Facebook listen to more music on a weekly basis , '' continues Ek . They listen to a wider variety of music – in fact we have more than 400 million playlists created in Spotify now . Because these users are more social , they 're more engaged . Because they 're more engaged , they 're more than twice as likely to pay for music `` Social discovery on Facebook means that we 're bringing people back to paying for music again . And that 's how the brilliant artists who create this music can continue creating it for us to enjoy . '' 8 . Facebook will fill in the social gaps that Spotify lacks Since its launch , Spotify has enabled you to scrobble to Last.fm to keep track of your most listened to artists and tracks . You can still do this , of course , but now your Facebook Timeline will populate with your listens , as well as your top albums , playlists and artists . And it will also provide the recommendation tech that Spotify has so needed . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Liked this ?

At Facebook 's F8 conference yesterday , the social networking site announced a new feature , called Facebook Timeline . This is an extended Facebook profile that shows not only what you 've been up to recently but everything you 've ever done since your debut on Facebook . It will run alongside your existing profile for the moment , but the signs are it may completely replace your profile in future . As you 'll see , it 's pretty visual , incorporating pictures , apps - including achievements such as run times - maps and video . You can sign up for Timelinehere .
Facebook has announced a number of new apps that will be used within the social network , offering up a more social way to listen to music , watch movies and read the news . Unveiled at Facebook 's f8 conference , these new type of 'open ' apps allow any company to create an app that allows social interaction . On board already are big names like Spotify and Netflix , both allowing you to see what music and movies your friends are watching and allow you to watch movies and listen to music straight from the Facebook homepage . There 's also a number of lifestyle apps . Included in this is a more interactive version of Nike Plus . These supercharged apps will aggregate all the interesting stuff you are doing and give you at a glance reports that you can add to the newly developed Facebook Timeline . Partners like Ticketmaster are also on board . Mark Zuckerberg said about the apps : `` The open graph is a completely new class of social apps to discover new things with your friends . '' Speaking about the Spotify app , Daniel Ek from Spotify said : `` Finding new music is always difficult and that is why we created Spotify . We knew the service had to be free and social . `` We have spent the last few years building a service where you can find music . Add this to Facebook 's 800 million users and this will light up the world . '' Zuckerberg revealed just how the new apps will work with the Timeline , explaining : `` You can fill out your Timeline with your favourite activities using apps and websites , and create a live connection to them so they 're updated as you go . `` For example , photographers can fill their Timeline with photo apps that will update with each new photo taken ; cooks can add recipe apps that will update with each new dish made ; and music fans can connect to apps that show their top playlists . '' Other companies that have signed up include the Guardian and the Independent - both offering their news in a more social way , essentially curating what you read on their websites and adding it to your feed - movie sites Netflix and Daily Motion , and music services such as Deezer , SoundCloud and MixCloud . You can sign up now to try a beta of the Timeline , which should allow you to try out a number of the new apps , including the music streaming .

Facebook has finally announced that it is teaming up with Spotify to offer song sharing straight from the pages of the social network . The link-up with Spotify is part of many partnerships announced with content providers , offering up social apps for lovers of music , movie and news . One of the biggest and most wanted tie-up is Spotify , which finally comes to Facebook through the new Timeline feature . The collaboration is a significant one for both companies , as it propels Spotify into the mainstream globally and pitches Facebook as an entertainment hub , as well as a social network – something that MySpace rebranded itself as recently . The link-up was unveiled at Facebook 's f8 conference , which TechRadar watched with representatives from Facebook UK . To greet the UK press , Joanna Shields , VP Europe , Facebook , said : `` This is the biggest announcement for the Facebook platform since 2007 . `` At Facebook , we like to say this journey is one per cent finished and tonight will be testament to that . '' Not only did CEO Mark Zuckerberg – now the 14th richest person on the Forbes rich list – take to the stage to announce changes to Facebook , but so did Spotify founder Daniel Ek , who said about the news : `` Finding new music is always difficult and that is why we created Spotify . We knew the service had to be free and social . `` We have spent the last few years building a service where you can find music . Add this to Facebook 's 800 million users and this will light up the world . '' The first hint that a link-up between Facebook and Spotify was happening came in August 2010 , when a revamp of the service offered deep Facebook integration . Since then there has been rumours that Facebook was looking to get into the music market – in June , information came out with regards to how its music dashboard would work . In July the rumour was it that its music service would be called Facebook Vibes , while back in May there were reports that Spotify and Facebook had signed a deal and that collaboration was incoming , but this did n't come to fruition . But this was before Spotify launched in the US , which has turned out to be the missing part of the Facebook/Spotify puzzle . But it 's not just Spotify who will be working with Facebook . Services like MixCloud , Deezer and SoundCloud have also come aboard on the music side . Facebook also announced that you will be able to watch TV shows and movies within Facebook - through Netflix , DailyMotion and others - and newspapers such as the Guardian and the Independent have also taken the social step , allowing their content to be shared and viewed within Facebook .
Mark Zuckerberg has used F8 to show off a new feature of the Facebook profile , called Facebook Timeline . Instead of being a realtime feed of events , Zuckerberg and co have created a past-time feed of your entire ( Facebook ) life , with the feature replacing everyone 's profile page . Speaking about Timeline Zuckerberg said : `` People feel an intense ownership over their profile . Millions of people have spent a lot time to tell the story of their life through their profile . `` Millions of people have spent years curating their lives and there 's nowhere to show this . We think we have the solution . The original profile was the first five minutes , the stream was your 15 minutes , now I want to show you the next . `` This is the heart of your Facebook experience , reworked from the ground up . We have been working on it the whole year and we are calling it Timeline . Timeline is meant to be the story of your life . It is a lot more visual and will have all your stories . One of the ways you can add to your Timeline is use a series of apps . Zuckerberg announced that you can load an app up that keeps a log of all your runs , what you cook etc . `` What Timeline does is shows all the important stuff recently , then summarises the rest of your life . This is the magic and how you can tell the whole story on a single page . '' There 's a number of ways you can see the Timeline , including a map view , showing you where you have been in the world . Timeline allows you to highlight and curate all your stories . It is essentially a profile within a profile - you will even have a profile pick for the Timeline section of Facebook . To make the Timeline work , a new class of apps have been created . These 'personal ' apps allow for you to express yourself in new ways , according to Facebook . Among those who have created apps for Facebook Timeline , include Spotify , The Guardian , and Netflix . All of these companies are hoping that you will embrace your social side , allowing Facebook to know what song , film or article you are reading at any one time so your friends can join in with the experience .
Mark Zuckerberg has managed to jump a whopping 21 places in the Forbes rich list , with the Facebook founder now at number 14 – his net worth now at $ 17.5 billion . This means he has leapfrogged Google 's Larry Page and Sergey Brin , who are in 15th position with a net worth of around $ 16.7 billion . It is Bill Gates who has topped the inaugural Forbes Rich List , however , adding a cool $ 5 billion to his mountain of cash . As always the annual Forbes Rich List is full of tech personalities . Other luminaries who have made the list include Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos , who sneaked into 13th place with $ 19.1 billion and Microsoft head Steve Ballmer in 19th place – his wallet is packed with $ 13.9 billion . Rounding off the top 50 is both Eric Schmidt and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar ; they both have $ 6.2 billion to spend on a Scrooge McDuck-style coin-filled swimming pool .

Facebook has announced that Spotify CEO Daniel Ek will speak at this week 's f8 conference , which almost certainly means that a link-up between the two companies is imminent . Ek will be part of panel chat called `` The future of digital music '' at the f8 event , which Facebook has traditionally used to announce new features and innovations . This year is set to be about the addition of entertainment content , which could see movies , tv shows , newspapers and music come to the site through established content providers . Speculation has been rife for most of 2011 that Spotify integration is coming to the social network as part of a Facebook Music service . With Ek attending and speaking at the event it would be highly surprising if Spotify was n't one of the launch partners for Facebook 's push to become a destination for entertainment content . It has been a big year for Ek 's company so far after finally establishing itself with a US launch . Facebook integration would be massive exposure for the product and enable it to push its Premium subscription service on a platform already visited by virtually all of its target audience . We 'll find out for sure in a couple of days , but at the moment all signs point to some sort of Facebook Music with Spotify platform becoming official on Thursday . Via : TechCrunch

Facebook has announced changes to the way posts are ordered on your News Feed , with those deemed 'most important ' now appearing at the top of the page . Depending on how often you visit the social network , you 'll either see the most recent stories or the top stories , when you visit the Facebook homepage . If you visit serveral times a day you 'll see new stuff at the top of the page , but if you only visit once a week you 'll see the top news from your closest friends and family . In a post on the company blog Facebook Engineering Manager Mark Tonkelowich said : `` When you pick up a newspaper after not reading it for a week , the front page quickly clues you into the most interesting stories . `` In the past , News Feed has n't worked like that . Updates slide down in chronological order so it 's tough to zero in on what matters most . `` Now , News Feed will act more like your own personal newspaper . You wo n't have to worry about missing important stuff . `` All your news will be in a single stream with the most interesting stories featured at the top . If you have n't visited Facebook for a while , the first things you 'll see are top photos and statuses posted while you 've been away . They 're marked with an easy-to-spot blue corner . '' Another change to the News Feed is the introduction of larger photo thumbnails , as you can see from the screenshot to your right . That particular change certainly makes it easier to enjoy photos without clicking the image and waiting for the strange new photo album interface to render properly . The blog also explained the previously-announced Ticker which brings real-time updates on the right hand side of the page . We 're expecting plenty more changes on Facebook this week as the f8 conference kicks-off on Thursday . As we reported yesterday , there 's plenty of speculation about tie-ins with movie , music and tv services and we 'll have the latest from f8 as it happens . Link : Facebook Blog

Facebook is set to launch a new entertainment offensive at the f8 conference , which gets underway later this week . The company is reportedly going to announce a new news feed which is dedicated to what members are reading , listening to and watching through the site . Central to the new ticker will be a whole batch of new media applications that will enable members to view entertainment content and share it with friends , without leaving Facebook.com The long-rumoured Spotify streaming link-up is set to be rubber stamped , while apps that allow movies and TV to be streamed and newspapers to be read are also expected to be announced . The Guardian is reporting that all of the above will form part of a `` watch , read and listen '' theme when Mark Zuckerberg addresses the audience at the f8 conference which begins 22 September . The report also asserts that changes to the `` Like '' button are also likely to be revealed at f8 . Instead of simply `` Like '' , developers will be able to add `` Want , '' `` Desire '' or `` Need '' Link : Guardian
Facebook is looking to roll out its Twitter-linking functionality to all of its users , according to a document sent out to developers and seen by the BBC . The new functionality will allow any user to use Facebook to post information in their news feed that will appear automatically in their Twitter feed as well . This is something that can already be done on Facebook , but only with fan pages – although there are a number of third-party apps out there that also allow you to link up Facebook posts with Twitter . The news of this proposed link-up comes just a week after Facebook announced some very Twitter-like functionality . The arrival of the Facebook Subscribe button means you can now subscribe to a Facebook profile that you are not friends with – just like Twitter 's social-networking model – and this will give you access to their news feed . Facebook 's inaugural F8 developers ' conference is set to take place 22 September , where the company is set to reveal a number of new features for the site . It is here that we could see Zuckerberg announce its new deal with Twitter . If this is the case , it will re-ignite privacy issues surrounding the social network ; although for the Twitter link-up to work it is thought you will need to set your profile to Public .

Following yesterday 's revamp of how your Facebook friends are grouped , the social network has now added an option to allow you to follow the activities of people you are n't friends with . The new 'Subscribe ' feature will bring public updates from other users , avoiding the often awkward need to send a friend request to those you may not know personally . The new feature , which mimicks very similar functionality on Twitter and Google+ , also makes it easy for attention-seekers like celebrities , bloggers and politicians to broaden the reach of their updates . For the users , it 's a great way to stay in touch with people they do n't actually know , or perhaps just follow those they may have an interest in stalking . Facebook , on the other hand , is marketing it as an easier way to control which posts from your friends shows up in your news feed . For example , if certain pals are always posting about Farmville , or those annoying surveys , you can subscribe to their posts but omit the stuff that brings your finger to the un-friend trigger . `` Until now , it has n't been easy to choose exactly what you see in your News Feed , '' said Facebook 's Zach Rait in a blog post . `` Maybe you do n't want to see every time your brother plays a game on Facebook , for example . Or maybe you 'd like to see more stories from your best friends , and fewer from your coworkers . '' `` You also could n't hear directly from people you 're interested in but do n't know personally—like journalists , artists and political figures . '' `` With the Subscribe button , we 're making it easier to do both . '' Everyone will be able to choose whether they have a Subscribe button on their profile and that can be managed on the Facebook subscriptions settings page . Facebook has started to roll-out the subscriptions feature , which should become available to you over the next few days . Just yesterday the company introduced Smart Lists , which automatically created lists for co-workers and school buddies for example , and Close Friends , which allowed you a seperate news feed from those users who 's updates you actually care about . Big changes happening at Facebook , and we 're sure Twitter is observing this one in particular with great interest .
A new version of Facebook for Android has appeared , with the v1.7 update adding a few tweaks to the app . Some of the changes that have been implemented include improvements to the app 's sharing functionality and it is now easier to tag people straight from your smartphone . The main changes to the sharing part of the app is to do with privacy – you can now toggle the settings on the app to match that of the website . The tagging tweaks now mean you can tag friends and places in posts . Facebook has decided to give the profile and Group Walls section a re-design as well , and it has also made some improvements to the messages and notifications within the app . Another small change is that photo browsing is better , as you can now swipe through images . The Facebook update for Android is part of some significant changes for the social network . Just this week it announced that it is adding a Smart Friends feature to the website . The update is available from the Android Market now . Via Eurodroid

Facebook has announced a host of improvements to the way your friends are grouped on the site . The new Smart Lists feature automatically pulls together your work friends , old school pals and those in the same locale , based in the information you include in your profile . The Smart Lists are automatically collated by Facebook , but you 'll also have the opportunity to edit as you see fit . There 's also opportunity to blot out those annoying acquaintances by only viewing updates from your close friends list , meaning you see less of the stragglers . The Close Friends list can appear as a separate news feed and you 'll also get notifications when one of your best mates posts an update . If you choose to add people to an Acquaintances list , you 'll only see the most important updates . If you do n't want to share anything with a friend , but do n't want to delete them , you can place them on a Restricted list and they 'll only see your public posts . You 'll be able to choose precisely who you share what with , from the Smart Lists to the Acquaintances , whenever you post an update . It 's up to you to manage these lists , but Facebook says it will also assist you by offering better suggestions . In a blog on the company website , Facebook 's Blake Ross said : This week , it will be easier than ever to see more from the people you care about and simpler to share with exactly the right people using Friend Lists . `` Want to see posts from your closest friends ? Or perhaps you 'd like to share a personal story with your family—without also telling all your co-workers . With improved Friend Lists , you can easily see updates from and share with different lists of friends . `` Lists have existed for several years , but you 've told us how time-consuming it is to organize lists for different parts of your life and keep them up to date .

Motorola looks like it 's going to be the next to join the Facebook phone race with the launch of a dedicated handset . The snappily-named Motorola EX225 has been outed over on the Bluetooth accreditation site Bluetooth SIG , and shows a simple QWERTY-keyboarded device with a little blue Facebook key in the corner . There are n't any Android buttons on show , so Motorola has either developed its own OS to power the device , or gone with something more widespread like Qualcomm 's Brew - unless the company is still working out where to place the Android keys . If it 's anything like the Vodafone 555 Blue , which also does n't run Android , we can expect Facebook to be part of every element of the phone from photo uploading to music sharing - and this time even a spot of 3G . There 's also a 2.4-inch screen ( apparently non-touch ) and is described as `` a product for trendy generation who enjoy connecting to the world anytime , anywhere '' . Hyper-rad . Another odd element : the phone will apparently come in a non-Facebook version , which helps us understand what Motorola is intending with this phone : a low-cost handset to service the rapidly-growing developing nations market that has an insatiable thirst for Facebook but limited access to the internet . If it 's passing through Bluetooth SIG now , we can probably expect the phone to land before Christmas , and our money 's on this being at the cheaper end of the spectrum .

Facebook 's profits soared in the first half of 2011 , hitting double the mark of the previous year , according to a Reuters report According to an inside source with knowledge of the figures , Facebook brought in $ 1.6 billion ( £1bn ) in revenue , with a net income of $ 500m ( £312m ) . As Facebook is still a privately owned company , it does not disclose its financial results , which makes Reuters ' revelation all the more interesting . In 2010 another unofficial report claimed that the company made $ 1.2 billion in revenue and £355m in profit for the first nine months of the year . With a bit of mathematical finagling and a touch of guess work , it can be reasonably assumed that Facebook was able to double both income and net income in that time . With Google+ breathing down Facebook 's neck , and Twitter looking to increase revenues , the reports show Facebook 's continued strength and appeal to advertisers . The company is now boasting an estimated 750m members and is also thought to be considering an IPO in the next year . Link : Reuters

Facebook has announced plans to launch a 'Trusted Friends ' scheme which can let pals assist if you find yourself shut out of your account . The scheme requires users to nominate three-to-five of their most reliable amigos , who are then required to input a special code in order to prove your identity . Trusted Friends will come in handy for users whose email has also been compromised by hacks , meaning they ca n't use the regular password recovery mechanism . In a post on the Facebook security page the social network said the new feature was akin to giving your friends a spare house key . The post read : `` Similar to other features that help you prove your identity through your friends , you can now select three to five trusted friends who can help you if you ever have issues accessing your account . `` It 's sort of similar to giving a house key to your friends when you go on vacation–pick the friends you most trust in case you need their help . `` If you forgot your password and need to login but ca n't access your email account , you can rely on your friends to help you get back in . `` We will send codes to the friends you have selected and they can pass along that information to you . '' It sounds like a good idea . Just make sure those `` Trusted Friends '' are n't the type who will use those special codes to break into your account and ruin your world while you 're off on a relaxing weekend in the country .

Facebook has announced that it will build its first European data centre near the Arctic Circle . The server-housing behemoth will be the size of 11 football fields and will handle all of Facebook 's European traffic . Not only will it be a huge investment in the Lulea region in Sweden , a town just on the cusp of the Arctic Circle , but it will also be a relatively environmentally friendly facility , with one of Facebook 's specifications being that it must run on renewable energy sources . `` Facebook required a certificate verifying that the energy consumed by the facility primarily should come from renewable resources . Thanks to our main river Lule , we can guarantee this , '' said Karl Petersen , Mayor of Lulea . In addition , the arctic air will act as the data centre coolant – which is very handy . Wonderfully , the press release came accompanied by this all-inspiring image of Matz Engman , CEO of Lulea Business Agency and Mayor Petersen :

Facebook has been talking social gaming at the London leg of its developer conference , F8 , today , claiming that it has more gamers than the Xbox , PlayStation and Nintendo platforms combined . Ethan Beard , Facebook 's director of partnerships , took to the stage to sweet talk the UK 's developers and explain the company 's upcoming Timeline feature . `` Social design inside social gaming has driven fantastic growth , '' he told delegates , of which TechRadar was one . `` It 's revolutionising gaming . We have over 200 million social gamers on Facebook every month ; that 's more Facebook gamers than the Xbox , PlayStation and Nintendo combined . '' The secret , Facebook contends , is that their gaming apps have been built around people rather than graphics or narrative . Beard explains , `` If you look at social games compared to PlayStation and Xbox , Facebook games are very simple . They 're Flash-based , plain graphics , the audio is what it is and you play in the browser ; it 's not that compelling . `` But the most important thing is that you play it with your friends . These are n't games with friends sprinkled on top ; it 's more about social interactions with gaming on top . '' The Facebook gaming revolution – which you simply can not talk about without mentioning Farmville – originally grew thanks to the news feed , where people 's achievements and ploughed fields were referenced almost non-stop . But it reached a point where people were n't posting to their profiles any more . Most of the world sighed with relief , no longer privy to the inner workings of their friends ' fictional smallholdings , but Facebook was less pleased . `` We went to users and asked , 'Why do n't you share more ? What can we do to make you want to share more ? ' and the answer was n't around privacy ( which was what we 'd been expecting ) , the answer was that they did n't want to spam their friends , '' Beard explained . `` Fix that spam problem , and users would share more ; that 's where the ticker comes in . '' Lucky for the non -ville minded among us , the fast-moving ticker is far easier to ignore .

Facebook has begun working with web companies to allow them to use Facebook Credits to buy items and play games outside of the social network . The scheme , which was announced through the official blog , could eventually see Facebook Credits become a universal web currency that can be used to replace conventional forms of online payment . The social networking giant is testing the scheme with with social games company GameHouse . GameHouse will use Facebook credits to allow members to play games like Collapse ! Blast and Uno on its own network as well as on Facebook.com , to offer a 'unified app experience ' . The blog post says : `` We have begun working with a few developers to test the ability to offer Facebook Credits on websites , with the goal of helping them offer a more unified app experience to users beyond apps on Facebook . One early example is Collapse ! Blast on Gamehouse.com . `` At this time , we are focused on gathering early developer feedback . We will keep you posted as our tests continue . If you are interested in Facebook Credits for websites should we broaden the test , please sign up here . '' Facebook will get 30 per cent of the proceeds according to the AllThingsD blog .

The Facebook iPad app has been a long time coming , but it 's landed with a bang roughly a week after Apple 's iPhone 4S launch event . Since the launch of the first iPad in 2010 , there has n't been an official Facebook app for Apple 's tablet – users have had the choice between using the web version or choosing one of the many third-party apps that tap into the popular social network , such as Friend.ly or MyPad+ . We got a glimpse of what was to come when the app was leaked in July , the code for the iPad edition hidden inside the iPhone version . But the cat is now officially out of the bag , so read on for a first look at the main features . As expected , there 's a single Universal app for both devices , with the iPhone version having had various updates too . It may sound like stating the obvious , but this is clearly designed for the iPad from the ground up . It does more than just take advantage of the big screen and gesture recognition : other iPad features including the cameras and location services have been thoughtfully integrated as well . It works happily in portrait and landscape orientations . Down the left-hand side is the main navigation bar , which you can show or hide at the touch of a button or with a quick swipe to the side , a bit like moving columns around in Twitter 's iPad app . It has chunky and easy to press buttons to take you to the various parts of the app . At the top is a search bar , to help you find friends , events and more quickly . The main content appears on the right , while along the top bar you 've got quick links to friend requests , messages and notifications , just like on the website . The main event - the news feed - looks much like it does on the web version . The familiar buttons to share photos , your status and to check in are across the top , and your friends ' updates below . You 've got the usual ability to comment on or Like anything there . Tapping through to read others ' comments brings up an additional column on the right-hand side . Sitting proudly at the top of the sidebar is your name , which takes you to your profile page . Tapping through gives you a bar down the left-hand side where you can get to your wall , information , photos and friends list , while your own posts and activity appear on the right-hand side . Your list of friends appears with big thumbnail images of their profile pictures with names below . Like in many iOS apps , there 's an A-Z scroll bar down the right-hand side you can tap on to jump to a particular part of the list . Taking advantage of the iPad 's wide screen , if you tap through to Messages from the left-hand bar , conversations appear as a two-column view , with the sender 's name on the left and sent and received messages in chronological order on the right . Alternatively , tapping the Messages button in the top bar brings down a pop-up menu from the top that gives you quick access to Messages , without the need to leave whatever page you 're viewing . In landscape orientation , a quick swipe from right to left brings up the Chat bar next to your News Feed , where friends who are online appear . The Share button at the top enables you to sign in or out . Tap the name of an online friend to bring up a chat window , which looks like the iOS Messages interface , but done in Facebook 's style and colours . When chatting , a QWERTY keyboard comes up underneath your News Feed , so you can chat and keep up with friends ' news and updates at the same time . As well as enabling you to upload existing photos and videos on your iPad to Facebook , you can shoot new ones with your iPad 's camera and share these with your friends . Browsing photos feels like you 're using the iPad 's own Photos app , with each album appearing as a stack of images you can tap through to . To show off the snaps , you can enlarge them to fullscreen size and swipe through them , or use the slider on the thumbnail bar at the bottom to browse . And because it supports AirPlay , you can even play videos on other AirPlay-enabled kit , such as the AppleTV or a Mac running AirServer . Like on the iPhone , you can check in using Facebook Places . Remember that the Wi-Fi-only iPad does n't have a GPS , so the accuracy of your own location will be determined by how many wireless networks there are around you . You can also view your friends ' check-ins on a map using the Nearby system , leaving a comment if you wish . This way , you can quickly check who 's in the same area as you at any time . Gaming on Facebook has been taken to a new level by enabling you to play your favourite titles in fullscreen , making the whole experience feel more immersive . And because Apps appear in the left-hand bar , they 're never more than a tap away .

The long-awaited Facebook for iPad app has finally been unleashed , the social networking giant has revealed . The free app , which has been in the works for well over a year and was revealed earlier this summer is finally ready to go , according to Facebook . Facebook for iPad now arrives boasting a slick , new iPad-centric user experience with tabbed navigation , allowing users to slide between profiles and menus , much like the Twitter iPad app . Photo albums have also been overhauled , with hi-res , screen-filling shots that Facebook says are `` easy to flick through , just like a real photo album . '' Multi-touch gestures also allow users to zoom in on photos , maps and other content . Other new features include gaming on the go and simpler , drop-down messaging functionality . Facebook says the changes are also being reflected in the company 's iPhone app . `` Many of you have been asking about Facebook for iPad , '' said Facebook engineer Leon Dubinsky . `` Today , it 's finally here . With the iPad app , you get the full Facebook experience , right at your fingertips . It 's a fun , colorful way to keep up with friends , share photos , chat and more . '' `` Facebook on the iPad feels fun , '' he added . `` Photos really shine on the iPad . They 're bigger and easy to flip through , like a real photo album . It 's like having a slideshow with all your friends and memories , wherever you go . '' Facebook for iPad has been beset by delays with CTO Brett Taylor explaining in an interview with the New York Times that `` it just was n't ready yet . '' Last month the app 's chief developer revealed that he had quit Facebook for Google as a result of Facebook 's unwillingness to launch the iPad app that he said had been complete for months . To add a little more drama , the app has not yet appeared in the App Store . Presumably it takes a while to appear in Apple 's listings . We 'll let you know when it lands . UPDATE : Facebook for iPad has landed on the App Store for your downloading pleasure
Facebook has continued its recent spate of acquisitions by snapping up social question and answer service Friend.ly . Friend.ly , which has existed as a third-party Facebook app for the last two years , encourages users to make new connections by answering questions relevant to them . Both companies have now acknowledged that the sale went through last week , although there 's been no official announcement on how much the acquisition cost Facebook . The social networking giant said in a statement it had been long-term admirers of its new partner . `` We 're excited to announce that we recently acquired friend.ly , a Silicon Valley startup that created a really compelling way for people to express themselves and meet others through answering question , said the statement . `` We 've admired the team 's efforts for some time now , and we 're looking forward to having Ed [ Friend.ly CEO Ed Baker ] and his colleagues make a big impact on the way millions of people connect and engage with each other on Facebook . '' In a blog post , Friend.ly seems over the moon with its new masters . It says it will continue as a stand-alone application , but will be working with Facebook on upcoming projects .

When pundits compare Facebook to AOL , they are n't being sarcastic : the similarities between the two services are striking . For many people today , Facebook is the internet , a walled garden that contains everything and everyone you 're interested in ; in the 1990s , AOL had the same role . AOL grew bigger , and more ambitious , and more controversial ; Facebook , as we know , has done exactly the same . But can it avoid the same fate ? The AOL of today is a shadow of its former self . Can Facebook stop history repeating ? Here are some of the traps that Facebook could fall into . AOL tried to do everything : it was an ISP , it was a social network , and it wanted to be a TV station and media empire too . That strategy reached its nadir with the Time Warner merger in 2000 , a largely unsuccessful marriage that ended in late 2009 . So far Facebook has concentrated on providing just the pipes and letting other firms do the content , so for example its new apps include content from the likes of The Guardian , music from Spotify and so on . If Facebook starts buying up media companies , it 's time to worry . AOL 's infamous trial-CD mountains already seem impossibly dated , but the firm pre-dated browsers and broadband and had to provide software so its customers could get online . Also , everybody had twirly moustaches , wore top hats and got around in horse-drawn carriages . Facebook , of course , grew up in the era of electricity , decent web browsers and ubiquitous flat-rate broadband , and probably does n't even know what CDs are . Where AOL was proprietary , Facebook is browser-based : tablet and smartphone apps are really just pretty front-ends for browser tech , and Facebook 's long-term goal is to use its Project Spartan technology to keep things HTML 5 and cross-platform . Facebook 's ongoing privacy controversies might be less of an issue if the firm took a leaf out of AOL 's book . No , not by getting a Penguin to explain everything - AOL did that in 2008 , with cartoons of Mr Penguin explaining how its ad targeting system worked - but by being proactive and offering users an opt-out from day one , which AOL did when it introduced tracking in 2007 . Facebook tends to roll out the privacy invasion first and then act all surprised when everybody gets upset . By the early 2000s AOL was facing a big problem : its business depended on charging people for services ( email , browsing , chat ) that they could now get for free . It did n't split its online services from its ISP business until 2006 , however , by which point competition was everywhere . Facebook wo n't repeat that error - it 's pledged to remain free , forever - but the downside is , of course , that it needs to make its money from intercepting our thoughts and following us when we go into shops . AOL was the original Hotel California of the internet , a service that it seemed you could never actually leave . Amazing as it sounds , some AOL staff would deliberately ignore customers ' cancellation requests , because those employees were given bonuses for retaining customers - whether those customers wanted to be retained or not . Facebook did n't do that , but for some time it was exceptionally difficult to kill a Facebook account - a state of affairs that 's now been resolved . AOL 's big movie moment was 1998 's You 've Got Mail , essentially Sleepless in Seattle remade with extra modem bonging noises , and to some the film was one big AOL ad . You ca n't say that about 2010 's The Social Network , which could n't have been less of an advert if director David Fincher had called it F * * * Zuck . Successful tech firms are like teenagers with their first credit card : their signature 's barely dry before they 're buying everything they see . One of AOL 's worst buys - and there have been many - was the social network Bebo , which it bought in 2008 for some $ 850 million and sold for just $ 10m in 2010 . So far , at least , Facebook 's acquisitions have talent buys rather than enormously expensive white elephants ; as Mark Zuckerberg has said , `` we buy companies to get excellent people '' . So is Facebook the new AOL ? For all the similarities , the differences are even greater . Facebook operates in a very different world to the one that made AOL successful , and its near-billion users make AOL 's US peak of 27 million users look like a very small village ISP . However , there are still some lessons that Facebook can learn : do n't buy businesses you do n't know what to do with , stick to what you 're good at , and try not to annoy your customers too much .

It 's been an interesting week for privacy . An enormous media company stands accused of bad behaviour , gross invasions of privacy and - let 's be generous here - less than perfect explanations of what it 's been up to . No , I do n't mean a tabloid newspaper . I mean Facebook . This week , US regulator the Federal Trade Commission accused Facebook of engaging in `` unfair and deceptive '' practices and promised to keep an eye on the social network for the next 20 years . It 's damning stuff , and the FTC lays it all out online . It 's a big list , but each item generally follows the same template : Facebook said it was doing one thing , when in fact it was doing the opposite . For example : `` Facebook promised users that it would not share their personal information with advertisers . It did . '' `` Facebook claimed that it complied with the U.S.- EU Safe Harbor Framework that governs data transfer between the U.S. and the European Union . It did n't . '' `` Facebook represented that third-party apps that users ' installed would have access only to user information that they needed to operate . In fact , the apps could access nearly all of users ' personal data - data the apps did n't need . '' You get the idea . What does Zuck say ? `` I think we have a good history of providing transparency and control over who can see your information '' , he writes in yet another official apology . Aaaagh ! For all my moaning , I do n't think Facebook is evil . I think , like some of the newspapers whose dirty laundry is currently being washed in the Leveson inquiry , Facebook genuinely believes its success means it 's doing the right thing . When Zuckerberg says `` everyone needs complete control over who they share with at all times . This idea has been the core of Facebook since day one '' , I think he means it . I do n't think it 's true , but do think he means it . The problem with Facebook is that its core business is incompatible with privacy : the more you share , the more effective its ad targeting . That tension is only going to get worse when Facebook goes public and has shareholders to answer to : public corporations ' number one objective is to make money , not to protect people 's privacy . That 's why it 's good to see the FTC taking action , and to see regulators in the EU having a word too . As a result of the FTC investigation and others , Facebook is appointing two chief privacy officers and has already taken many of the FTC 's recommendations on board ; over the next 20 years , the FTC will arrange for biannual , independent privacy audits to make sure the service is keeping his promises . When Mark Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to `` offer new ways to protect you and your information better than any other company in the world , '' I 'm sure he means it - but I 'm glad we have regulators to make sure that this time , he keeps his promises . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Liked this ?

Facebook has donned its hard hat and done a spot of data mining , revealing some statistics about its Open Graph initiative , which allows users to share with their friends just what they are reading online . At f8 back in September Facebook announced it had created a new type of app for media partners that would allow newspapers like the Guardian , the Independent and the New York Times to find out just what articles of theirs were being read by Facebook users . According to Facebook , the Open Graph has been a success and results show the the Guardian 's app now reaches four million monthly active users and many of them being from a demographic that the paper has found hard to reach – the 24 and under category . The Washington Post app has had 3.5 million active users and 83 per cent of those are under 35 years old . Yahoo News and the Independent have also significant traffic increases – Yahoo by 600 per cent and The Independent garnering 1 million readers for its app . When it comes to what has been the most read , it is the New York Times that has the most popular article – one which centres round before and after pictures of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami . Speaking about the results , Andrew Miller , chief executive officer of Guardian Media Group , said : `` As well as increasing traffic , the app is making our journalism visible to new audiences . Over half of the app 's users are 24 and under - traditionally a very hard-to-reach demographic for news organisations . `` The Facebook app is one of a number of successful launches by the Guardian in recent months as our digital-first strategy gains momentum . We 're delighted with the results . ''

Facebook has completed quite a significant chunk of data mining and believes that the social network has cut the 'six degrees of separation ' theory down to just four . For those who are n't au fait with Six Degrees Of Separation it 's a Will Smith movie , but that 's not important right now – what is important is that Facebook believes that you may now be linked to a random stranger in just four degrees ( five hops ) rather than the much-debated six . `` Using state-of-the-art algorithms developed at the Laboratory for Web Algorithmics of the Università degli Studi di Milano , we were able to approximate the number of hops between all pairs of individuals on Facebook , '' explained the Facebook data team in a blog . `` We found that six degrees actually overstates the number of links between typical pairs of users : While 99.6 per cent of all pairs of users are connected by paths with 5 degrees ( 6 hops ) , 92 per cent are connected by only four degrees ( 5 hops ) . `` And as Facebook has grown over the years , representing an ever larger fraction of the global population , it has become steadily more connected . The average distance in 2008 was 5.28 hops , while now it is 4.74 . '' To back up Facebook 's theory , the blog links to two studies that show that we are now all linked by just four degrees of separation . Rumour has it MySpace is trying to outdo Facebook with its 'three degrees theory ' , which involves playing the song 'When Will I See You Again ' on its site on loop .
Facebook may yet release a smartphone of its own , with the latest rumours pointing to an HTC-made handset codenamed Buffy . The handset is supposedly being built on Android , but a heavily customised version that Facebook is fiddling with in order to integrate its many and varied services into the handset from the off , just as Buffy Summers integrated seamlessly with Mr Pointy and her crucifix after a spot of training . We imagine this means the handset will 'run ' Facebook rather than requiring an app to take you into the network – rather like the Amazon Kindle Fire which is based on Android but keeps you in a fairly walled Kindle-infested garden . Rather than the slowly-dying-as-though-it-accidentally-stumbled-into-the-sunlight Flash , the Buffy handset will apparently take HTML5 as its core app platform . According to All Things D , which broke the story , Facebook has only recently decided to go with HTC as its hardware partner , after what we can only assume was a fist-fight to the death between it and Samsung . Because Facebook and HTC have only just agreed to this clandestine union , we 're more likely to see the Facebook phone land at Mobile World Congress 2013 than the 2012 show , with the hardware likely to be 12 to 18 months off . We like this rumour and having experimented with the HTC Chacha and Salsa it would n't exactly be a shocker if it turned out that Facebook plans to launch its own phone .

The digital music market is not in a great place right now and is in need of some major change : CD sales are still shrinking more quickly than digital revenues are growing ; doubts are growing over the freemium model ; overall consumer adoption remains niche . So what does Google do ? It launches another download store . Come on Google , you are one of the internet 's giants . You thrive upon disrupting markets , and all you do is launch a me-too download store with an unlicensed locker feature ? ! Of course some of the blame has to be laid at the feet of the labels for restricting what services can aspire to with their current licensing structures . But Google must equally shoulder the blame for not pushing harder and for not offering the labels more in return ( and I 'm not talking cash ) . I 'm told that Google had planned to go to market with something much more ambitious but could n't get the licenses ( or perhaps at the prices they were willing to pay ) . Google is arguably the most important digital conduit in the world . If Google is unable to bring that influence to bear in negotiations then what hope is there for start-ups ? Google really should have pushed harder , until they got something truly amazing to work with . But even that is n't an excuse that Google can really hide behind either . Take a look at what Facebook achieved without having to sign a single licensing deal . To use the cliched management consultant saying , Facebook thought 'out of the box ' . Google meanwhile did n't so much as think within in it as let the labels tape them into it . A while ago I wrote a piece talking about the Triple A of digital music ( Apple , Android , Amazon ) and the increasing consolidation of the market around them . Those three players are the ones who bring the scale and stability that the major record labels so keenly crave and those are the three that the licensed service space is increasingly consolidating around . And yet Facebook 's subtly brilliant strategy of becoming the universal content dashboard looks increasingly like being the smartest play on the board . While everyone outside the Triple A falls over themselves to become a part of Facebook 's coalition of unaligned powers , Facebook quietly becomes arguably the single most important force in digital music by : So while Amazon and Google run around trying to beat Apple at the download game ( which by the way , without closed device ecosystems they 'll always come second ) Facebook avoids having to deal with labels , brings something new to the digital music equation and quietly builds the data foundations of something potentially transformational to launch further down the line . Facebook can do all this because it is has such massive reach and scale , because as one of the two doorways into our online lives , it is one of the two true 21st Century Portals , that knows and shapes our activity . The other 21stCentury Portal ? Google . Google could have done so much more , with or without licences ( and I mean legitimately by the way ) . Indeed the music industry needs Google to do so much more . Of course the store will be a success . Google has such a massive addressable audience it 'd really have to screw up not to make it some sort of success . But Google needs to think whether it wants its digital music success to be measured in terms of download store market share , or something much bigger , something transformational . The simple question is , does it want to be Apple or does it want to be Facebook ? This piece was first published on Mark Mullian 's Music Industry Blog . For 11 years Mark was a vice president and research director at Jupiter Research ( later acquired by Forrester Research ) .

Facebook has been hit with a surge of violent and pornographic images spreading across the network in the last 24 hours . The photoshopped images show celebrities like Justin Bieber appearing to a perform hardcore sex act , while there 's unsavoury pictures of dogs being abused . The photos have apparently spread through a click-jacking virus , which encourages users to click on seemingly innocuous links and then goes on a widespread re-posting spree throughout their friend list . Facebook has said in a statement that it is aware of the problem and is investigating . The company said : `` Protecting the people who use Facebook from spam and malicious content is a top priority for us and we are always working to improve our systems to isolate and remove material that violates our terms . `` We have recently experienced an increase in reports and we are investigating and addressing the issue . '' Graham Clueley of the Sophos security software firm says that Facebook may end up losing users unless it acts quickly to prevent another outbreak . `` It 's precisely this kind of problem which is likely to drive people away from the site , '' he blogged . `` Facebook needs to get a handle on this problem quickly , and prevent it from happening on such a scale again . `` Of course , this incident raises another important question . Many firms may be comfortable allowing users to access sites such as Facebook , but what happens when hardcore pornographic and offensive content is being spread . Should companies block access to sites hosting offensive content ? '' Facebook contacted TechRadar about the spam attack who explained : `` Protecting the people who use Facebook from spam and malicious content is a top priority for us . `` Recently , we experienced a spam attack that exploited a browser vulnerability . Our team responded quickly and we have eliminated most of the spam caused by this attack . `` We are now working to improve our systems to better defend against similar attacks in the future .

Facebook users will have to opt in to any changes to the site that can affect privacy settings , following a U.S. government clampdown on the social network , reports have claimed . Traditionally , the company has pushed through new features , with members having to then manually adjust their security controls if they then want to opt out . However , Facebook is reportedly close to a deal with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) in the US , to completely reverse that policy so members are able to personally sign-up for the changes . The FTC has alleged that Mark Zuckerberg 's company deceived members during an upgrade to the site in 2009 . This deal is seen as a settlement of the dispute . A report in the Wall Street Journal says : `` The proposed settlement – which is awaiting final approval from the agency commissioners – would require Facebook to obtain `` express affirmative consent '' if Facebook makes `` material retroactive changes . '' '' The settlement means that Facebook will have to abandon its 'do first , do n't even bother to ask questions later ' policy and will now a harder time pushing new features that affect privacy settings . Now users will have to manually opt in to see the new features , rather than going to the trouble of visiting their account settings to opt out after changes have already been made . Facebook will likely get around this by serving-up pop-up notifications featuring pages and pages of disclaimers in the same way iTunes simply has us clicking `` Accept '' through sheer laziness . The controversy began two years ago when Facebook made changes that made profile information , photos and wall posts available to the public until users opted to tighten-up security controls .

Facebook added music sharing elements to its news feed and ticker just six weeks ago , but already 1.5 billion tracks have been shared on the social network . Given that Facebook has over 800 million active users , it means a fair portion of Facebookers are already sharing music on the site . One of the major partners in the new sharing functionality , Spotify , has added `` well over '' four million users since the announcement at F8 . After a rocky start that saw complaints from secret Celine Dion fans whose guilty musical pleasures were suddenly broadcast to all their Facebook friends , it seems that Facebook-loving Spotify users have taken to sharing their listening habits with pals like rappers to Lamborghinis . How many of these new subscribers have come directly via Facebook is n't clear , as the integration came very shortly after Spotify 's launch into the US . Other smaller music services have enjoyed the PR boost that the Facebook integration brought them , with Deezer attributing some of its 10,000 new users a day to the social tie-in , and Earbits , MOG , Rdio and Slacker also reporting increased success since F8 . `` Some of our biggest music developers have more than doubled their active users , while earlier-stage start-ups and services starting with a smaller base have seen anywhere between a 2-10x increase in active users , '' wrote Casey Maloney Rosales Muller on the Facebook developer blog . With Facebook `` getting closer to a wider roll-out of Timeline and the Open Graph '' , expect to hear more from the social network in the near future .

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg yesterday described Google+ as Google 's attempts to `` build their own little version of Facebook '' , prompting a retort from the search giant . Speaking to Bloomberg , Bradley Horowitz , Google 's VP of product , said in response to Zuckerberg 's comments , `` We are delighted to be underestimated , it 's served us very well to date . '' Despite coming back with that little zinger of his own , Horowitz insists that Google is n't interested in a spat with the social network , positing that Google+ is a different thing entirely . `` When people first saw our service they speculated , they said 'Oh it 's just like Facebook ' , and others said 'No , it 's more like Twitter ' and in the interim we have created a community and experience that is uniquely our own . `` A lot of the pitting the companies against each other ... it certainly sells advertising and clicks , it 's an intriguing story . But when we think about what we 're doing , we think about how we can make Google services better . '' Zuckerberg agrees , in part . At first he implies that it 's not a war , before going on to tell US broadcaster Charlie Rose that Facebook sees itself aligning with Amazon and Apple , while Google is more of a rival : `` People like to talk about war . There are a lot of ways in which the companies work together . There are real competitions in there , but I do n't think this is going to be the type of situation where there 's one company that wins all the stuff . `` Google in some ways is more competitive and is certainly trying to build their own little version of Facebook . When I look at Amazon and Apple , I see companies that are extremely aligned with us . We have a lot of conversations with people at both companies trying to figure out ways in which we can do more together . '' These protests are n't fooling anyone - all the veiled comments and back-handed sniping make it pretty clear that someone needs to lock Google and Facebook in a room with no sharp implements until they can get all this straightened out .

Facebook Messenger for Windows has appeared in the wild , with the client allowing people to communicate to their Facebook buddies without going through a browser . Facebook 's Messenger offering has proven to be a hit on the massive social network , and the inevitable Windows program has now finally made its appearance . The offering at the moment is currently being tested on a 'small group of people ' but you can go and download it from Facebook itself if you wish to give it a go . `` Messenger is a Windows is a new , trial application that lets you use Facebook without being on www.facebook.com , '' explains Facebook . `` While you surf the web or use other applications on your computer , you can chat and message with your friends on Facebook , see the latest updates from your friends in ticker and get quick notifications about what 's going on , '' the explanation continues . `` We 're testing out a first version of the app with a small group of people . During this trial period , we plan on rolling out changes to the app and expect outages and periods of instability as we make improvements . '' Of course , Facebook 's success has largely been web and app based to date , so it will be interesting to see if a client is popular . Especially as it is going head to head with the likes of Microsoft 's well-established instant messenging client .

Two primary school teachers have 'relinquished their positions ' after they allegedly made insulting remarks about pupils on Facebook . The teachers at Westcott primary school in Hull became embroiled in a row over comments they 're said to have made in an online exchange using the social networking site . One post read : `` No wonder everyone is thick … inbreeding must damage brain development , '' which was printed out and posted on fences outside the school gates . Another post made reference to pupils spotted queueing in a discount store . Former head teacher Debbie Johnson and teacher Nyanza Roberts have now left the school , while other members of the faculty have been 'concluded ' through the school 's disciplinary procedures . Chair of governors Mary Wallace said : `` Further to my last letter in which I promised to keep you updated with any developments at the school I write to inform you the investigation into the Facebook matter which affected a number of staff within the school has now been concluded . `` The details will remain confidential for legal reasons . `` However , I am able to inform you Ms Johnson and Miss Roberts have decided to relinquish their posts at Westcott primary school from December 2011 and will pursue other opportunities .

It may come to a shock for some , but there 's actually a real life outside of Facebook and now the social network is showcasing events you could get involved in . The current events tab is a place that tells you what events you have coming up but now this is being expanded to include upcoming events which the social network reckons you will be interested in . Facebook finds out what your interests are by data-mining your account for relevant information – so you better double-check all those bands you liked way back in 2006 are still ones you are interested in , as you 'll probably begin to get notifications when they are playing a gig near you . It will also check your , er , checking-in data – so if you regularly check into a club and there 's some sort of event going on there , then you will probably hear about it on Facebook . It makes sense then that Facebook bolstered its check-in service with the buyout of Gowalla in November . Oh , and all that music you 've been sharing since Facebook apps launched , it will be peering into that too and picking out artists you may be interested in . Although the suggested events feature is said to be in testing and was first spotted by the bods at TechCrunch , most will have it by now . At the moment , our feed seems to be filled with events that our friends may or may not being going to . And , in turn , events we have n't actually been invited to – which in no way made us feel like a social outcast . Check your suggested events out at : www.facebook.com/events/suggestions .

Nintendo has spoken out about social gaming , claiming that many companies providing games for social networks are simply 'doing the same thing over and over again ' . Speaking to All Things D , Nintendo 's America President Reggie Fils-Aime , conveniently dismissed the fact that the company is on to its seventh iteration of Mario Kart , its 15th year of Zelda and its umpteenth Super Mario game , claiming that Nintendo is innovating in all these games to make them `` more fun and add enjoyment for the consumer '' , implying that social gaming companies are not following suit . `` [ Consumers ' ] desires for what 's new continues to be pushed out , so delivering the same experience all the time… consumers will move on , '' he said . `` When I look at gaming experiences on social networks , there 's a variety of entertainment value . Some are strong , some are not . But in the end , how will they evolve ? Doing the same thing over and over again is no longer fine . '' Fils-Aime also reckons that the company is n't likely to port Mario and pals over to Facebook or its ilk , despite the tough times the Nintendo 3DS has had since launch and the lucrative figures successful companies like Zynga have been posting . `` We make games for Nintendo devices and that is a competitive advantage for us , '' he said . `` You can only play Mario on a Nintendo device ... I would n't expect to see our franchises on other platforms , and I would argue Facebook is a platform , '' he said . These comments also seem to put to bed requests from investors that Nintendo release Mario games on iOS and Facebook . Wise or witless ? No comment - but it 'll be interesting to see if Nintendo changes its tune after the launch of the Wii U next year . From All Things D
Facebook has revealed what it believes is the most popular games of the year on its website , with Playdom 's Gardens of Time hitting the top spot . This is despite Zynga 's Cityville being the most popular Facebook game , regularly clocking in 100 million active users – something TechCrunch has pointed out to the social network . According to Facebook , though , the list of the most popular games was compiled in a way which did n't actually take into account how many visits the games had . `` This list was compiled by looking at the top games on Facebook with more than 100,000 monthly active users and giving priority to those games with the highest user satisfaction scores , '' explained Facebook . `` The result is a list of the games that received the most user recommendations in 2011 . '' While we will let others grumble over the fact that Facebook should have named the list 'The most satisfactory games in 2011 ' , the list does show just how popular social gaming has become and how game developers are breaking out of Silicon Valley , with games created by devs from Seattle , Santa Monica , Canada , Germany , Japan , Serbia , and Prague littering the most popular list . The full list of the most popular / should really be satisfactory games of the year for Facebook is as follows : Gardens of Time ( By Playdom ) The Sims Social ( By EA ) Cityville ( By Zynga ) DoubleDown Casino ( by DoubleDown Interactive ) Indiana Jones Adventure World ( By Zynga ) Words With Friends ( By Zynga ) Bingo Blitz ( By Buffalo Studios ) Empires & Allies ( By Zynga ) Slotomania-Slot Machines ( By Playtika ) Diamond Dash ( By wooga )
Facebook has agreed to make key changes to the data it currently keeps indefinitely about which adverts its non-US users click on . Because its headquarters are located in Ireland , an audit by the country 's data protection commissioner ( IDPC ) has brought about recommendations and immediate changes from the social network . `` Audit reports are not frequently made public , but in this case , the DPC and Facebook agreed at the outset that - in the interests of transparency - the contents of the audit should be made public , in full , immediately upon completion , '' blogged Facebook 's director of public policy in Europe , Richard Allan . `` We believe this is the best way for users and policymakers around the world to understand how thoroughly the DPC performed its examination and how closely we will be working together in the future , '' he added . Interestingly , Facebook 's targeted advertising ( based on the user 's profile ) was considered legitimate and the 'real name policy ' in which people are not allowed pseudonyms is valid and justified . The controversial `` suggested tagging '' system – which stirred up huge controversy – did lead to some criticism from the IDPC : `` The introduction of Tag Suggest , a popular tool to make the tagging of large numbers of images quick and easy , could have been done in a more transparent fashion , '' added Allan . `` Despite these concerns , the DPC did not find that the launch of Tag Suggest breached Irish data protection law , and confirmed that the function used to delete the user 's facial profile is invoked when the user disables `` tag suggestions . '' `` The DPC recommended we take a 'best practice ' approach in this area and display additional notifications to users in Europe , to help them learn more about the feature . '' Among the other key commitments from Facebook are : `` We work on a daily basis with regulators around the world , and we appreciate the investment of time and effort by the DPC and its leadership to improve the experience of Facebook users , '' concluded Allan . `` We have benefited from the open , honest and cooperative relationship and look forward to continue working together .

Facebook has announced that it has finally released its new Timeline functionality from the clutches of the few and has made it available to everyone . Timeline was announced at this year 's f8 - the same time as Facebook 's Spotify partnership - and is being pushed by the social network as `` an easy way to rediscover the things you shared , and collect your most important moments . `` It also lets you share new experiences , like the music you listen to or the miles you run . '' To access Timeline , you have to head over to the Introducing Timeline section of Facebook and click a link to start using the feature . As there may be a number of things from your past you do n't want the world to know about – like the music you were listening to when you killed someone and how many miles you ran to get away from the body – Facebook is giving you a seven-day reprieve to get your online information in order . In this time you can review everything that is being shown and make adjustments where necessary . Facebook has announced that Timeline wo n't just be kept for the full-fat version of the site , but will also be available through its Android app and on m.facebook.com . So you can scroll through images of you through the years and see how much you 've changed . Be warned , when we tried this , it looked an awful lot like a balloon slowly deflating .

What do Charlie Sheen , an inebriated elk and a steaming turd have in common ? They all feature on Facebook 's list of the UK 's most-shared news stories of 2011 . Taking stats from media outlets like the BBC , The Sun , The Guardian and the Daily Mail , Facebook looked at article clicks , likes and shares on the social network to compile the list . In at number one is the BBC 's 'The world at seven billion ' , which invited users to put in their date of birth to find out where they rank in the number of people born ; little wonder , when everyone and their dog took to their status updates to share the scintillating information that they were the 4,818,144,234th person alive on earth . The Sun 's coverage of a woman whose boyfriend tattooed a poo on her back was the second most shared story in the UK , while The Guardian 's investigation into police crackdowns on the Occupy movement came in third . The Swedish elk that got three sheets to the wind on fermenting apples and found itself stuck in a tree , Amy Winehouse 's untimely death , Charlie Sheen 's very public meltdown and X-Factor brat Frankie Coccozza all feature in the top 20 count down . Newspapers and news websites have been quick to latch on to the Facebook Platform , introduced at f8 in September , with many reporting sharp increases in traffic from Facebook . Here 's the top twenty run down in full : BBC : The World at Seven Billion The Sun : Tatt-poo for cheating The Guardian : The shocking truth about the crackdown on Occupy BBC : Amy Winehouse : Tributes paid to dead singer BBC : Austrian driver allowed 'pastafarian ' headgear photo The Guardian : Charlie Sheen v Muammar Gaddafi : whose line is it anyway ? The Guardian : The meaning of 9/11 's most controversial photo Daily Mail : Amy Winehouse , 27 , found dead at her London flat after suspected 'drug overdose ' BBC : Drunk Swedish elk found in apple tree near Gothenburg BBC : 'Brinicle ' ice finger of death filmed in Antarctic Daily Mail : Robber who broke into hair salon is beaten by its black-belt owner and kept as a sex slave for three days ... fed only Viagra The Sun : Frankie Cocozza kicked off X Factor BBC : Japan earthquake : Footage of moment tsunami hit BBC : Osama Bin Laden , al-Qaeda leader , dead - Barack Obama The Guardian : Osama bin Laden corpse photo is fake BBC : Japan earthquake : Tsunami hits north-east BBC : Speed-of-light results under scrutiny at Cern BBC : Arrest over video of 'racist rant ' on Croydon to Wimbledon tram Daily Mail : Loyal to the end : Heart-breaking photo shows Navy SEAL 's devoted dog guarding his coffin BBC : LIVE : Osama Bin Laden dead

Facebook has moved quickly to lockdown a security flaw which briefly allowed users to see your private photo albums , just by reporting a public photo as containing nudity . As a means of making his point , the hacker was able to exploit the flaw to access the private albums of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg before posting them online . Prior to the fix , it seems that reporting a photo as nudity or pornography would allow you to view other photos listed as private . The idea was to enable the offended party to make the social network aware of further lewd pictures . A Facebook spokesperson admitted the flaw to Gizmodo , attributing the security lapse to a bug in a recent code push . The statement said : `` Earlier today , we discovered a bug in one of our reporting flows that allows people to report multiple instances of inappropriate content simultaneously . `` The bug allowed anyone to view a limited number of another user 's most recently uploaded photos irrespective of the privacy settings for these photos . `` This was the result of one of our recent code pushes and was live for a limited period of time . Upon discovering the bug , we immediately disabled the system , and will only return functionality once we can confirm the bug has been fixed . '' This revelation was the last thing that Facebook needed following its reprimand from the FTC in the United States over a series of privacy violations .

Facebook has confirmed that it has bought location-based social network Gowalla for an undisclosed sum . There were reports at the weekend that Facebook had purchased Gowalla , but these were from an anonymous source . At the time both companies stayed tight-lipped about the acquisition but now they have gone public with statements revealing that Gowalla would indeed be integrated into the sprawling social mass that is Facebook . `` We 're excited to confirm that Gowalla co-founders Josh Williams and Scott Raymond , along with other members of the Gowalla team , are moving to Facebook in January to join our design and engineering teams , '' said a Facebook spokesperson in a statement . `` In talking with the Gowalla team , we realised that we share many of the same goals : building great products that reach millions of people , making a big impact quickly , and creating new ways for people to connect and share what 's going on in their lives . `` While Facebook is n't acquiring the Gowalla service or technology , we 're sure that the inspiration behind Gowalla will make its way into Facebook over time . '' Over on Gowalla 's blog , there is a statement that outlines just how the deal took place . It seems that at a recent f8 conference , co-founders Josh Williams and Scott Raymond were tapped up by Facebook and they decided a few weeks later to sell the site to the social network . `` Gowalla , as a service , will be winding down at the end of January . We plan to provide an easy way to export your Passport data , your Stamp and Pin data ( along with your legacy Item data ) , and your photos as well . Facebook is not acquiring Gowalla 's user data . `` We know how much many of you loved Gowalla . It 's been the highlight of our lives as we 've built it with your help over the past two years . As we move forward , we hope some of the inspiration behind Gowalla – a fun and beautiful way to share your journey on the go – will live on at Facebook . ''

Mega social networking site Facebook has bought location service Gowalla for an undisclosed sum . Gowalla 's check-in service will be used to bolster Facebook 's upcoming Timeline interface , which founder Mark Zuckerberg describes as , 'the story of your life : all your stories , all your apps and a new way to express who you are . ' Gowalla started as a FourSquare-esque location-based system , but soon became aimed towards travellers who want to document their journeys . An anonymous source told CNN that , 'As far as the big picture , Gowalla 's vision is about people telling stories , and Facebook 's vision for Timeline is about stories about important moments in life . ' It 's not known whether Gowalla will maintain its own identity , or if it will be swallowed up into Facebook 's new system . Gowalla 's service can also be linked to alternative social networking sites like Twitter and Foursquare , but it 's similarly unclear if this will be maintained . It 's an interesting move from Facebook , and hopefully Zuckerberg 's company will be able to sort out the automatic rotation of portrait photos .

Facebook has decided to increase the limit of status updates on the site to 63,206 characters – a far cry from the 140 characters of Twitter . Facebook has n't yet revealed the reason for allowing over 60,000 characters in a post but it seems that it could well be used to post long-form content for journalists . This is n't the first change the social network has made to its status character limit in 2011 . Back in March it upped the limit from 500 to 5,000 and now it has expanded this again by over 10 times . Originally Facebook used the much more conservative and SMS friendly character count of 160 when it was first made available to the general public . Facebook 's update about its , er , status update was actually rather short . It explained : `` You can now write posts with more than 60,000 characters , including status , group and wall posts . `` For reference , a novel has roughly 500,000 characters . This could be shared in nine posts . '' And if you think talk of character could n't get any geekier , software engineer Bob Baldwin came up with the precise limit through an equation-cum-Easter egg : `` I set the exact limit to something nerdy . Facebook ... Face Boo K ... hex ( FACE ) - K ... 64206 - 1000 = 63206 : - ) '' he wrote on hit Facebook wall . Despite upping the limit , Facebook still gets beaten hands down by Google+ when it comes to status updates , as it allows up to 100,000 characters .

You may rue the day that Facebook introduced song sharing ( now we all know about your insatiable appetite for the High School Musical soundtrack ) , but Facebook 's pretty pleased with it , having racked up five billion song shares since f8 in September . Speaking at the Midem conference in Cannes , Facebook 's Dan Rose did n't elaborate much , so we do n't know how much of the five billion is down to Spotify and how many song shares have come from partnerships with other music services like Deezer . Last we 'd heard , Facebook reported 1.5 billion tracks had been shared using Spotify in November 2011 ; whichever way you look at it , 3.5 billion tracks in two months is good going . Now that Facebook is rolling out Timeline to all its users , this kind of seamless social sharing is only set to grow . Other companies have already come on board , with Netflix taking care of your movie-watching and Zeebox handling your TV habits and over sixty more new apps to keep your friends posted on everything from what gigs you 're at to what food you 're eating . But with bite-sized song sharing overtaking the Facebook ticker , who knows whether we 'll even notice all that . Now , excuse us , we 're off to switch private listening on . From The Next Web

Facebook 's long-awaited debut on the stock market could be underway as early as next week , as the company prepares to file IPO papers , according to the Wall Street Journal . The Initial Public Offering , which is unlikely to take place until the autumn , will value the social network at anywhere between $ 75bn and $ 100bn , says the report . The company hopes to raise $ 10 billion in cash from the offering and could file papers underwritten by Morgan Stanley as early as Wednesday . If Facebook gained a $ 100 billion valuation through the offering , it would see the company draw level with McDonald 's in terms of market worth , put it about halfway to overhauling Google . A Facebook floatation would see the culmination of a long-awaited to journey towards the stock market . If Facebook were to become a publicly traded entity , interested observers would glean more insight into the company 's income , earnings , performance and strategy in quarterly earnings reports . It would also mean , for the first time , maverick CEO Mark Zuckerberg would have to answer to shareholders . Interesting times lie ahead , it seems . Via : WSJ

Lord Justice Leveson has suggested that social networks like Twitter and Facebook could be treated differently to news organisations in any future media regulation reforms . The judge is presiding over an investigation into the ethics , practices and culture of the media following the phone hacking scandal . He says that online news organisations publishing news are different from people having conversations on Facebook regarding news and should be treated as such . He said : `` I think that I might see there is a distinction between Facebook , where one person is communicating with their friends , or Twitter , and organisations that are in the business of selling themselves with reference to news or information . `` That is the difference between the pub chatter , to take the analogy that was mentioned before , and that which the state – I do n't mean government , I say immediately , but the broad corpus of all of us – has an interest in seeing as a level playing field . '' The deliberations could eventually see a new set of rules introduced for the social networks differentiating them from online newspapers or news aggregators . The debate has centred around complaints from well-known celebrities that they are powerless to stop the spread of often false information with no recourse . JK Rowling complained to Justice Leveson last year that `` a lie can spread around the world before the truth had got its boots on , '' after complaining about family photos appearing online .
Zynga , the social games studio behind Farmville , has announced its new Bingo game for Facebook . The age-old , OAP-friendly pastime comes to the social network in much the same guise as it has been played in Bingo halls across the UK for generations . Players will enter rooms with Facebook friends or random members and cross numbers off their cards as numbers are called to the room . There are a series of themed rooms that the games will take place in , like Las Vegas Casino , although smoky Doncaster social club is sadly not listed amongst them . Like Zynga Poker , players can see which rooms their friends are in and chat as the game is going on , while playing up to six cards at a time to increase the chances of winning . Beyond the traditional card-completing antics , there 's also power-ups which help you complete your B-I-N-G-O cards faster , but these and playing multiple games will cost you more virtual currency . The game is currently in Beta but will soon launch to the public . You can check out Zynga Bingo in the video below . Via : TechCrunch

Brace yourself for a glut of complaints invading your newsfeed over the next few weeks : Facebook is rolling out Timeline to all users . While Facebook offered the option to update your profile to the timeline layout before Christmas , it will be forcing upgrades to all accounts in the coming weeks . Like the early adopters , new Timlineers ( that name may need work ) will have seven days to get used to the timeline and remove anything embarrassing before friends can see the new layout . Announced at last year 's f8 conference , Timeline is Facebook 's attempt at collating literally everything you ever do , from watching TV to climbing Mount Everest . All your Facebook activity is listed chronologically , taking in status updates , songs you 've listened to , photos , events you 've attended , notes you 've written and what friends you 've made along the way . But what 's really excellent about Timeline is that it makes it look like you did nothing of note between being born and joining Facebook . Sure , Zuck . Sure .

Facebook engineer Blake Ross has led the creation of a web tool which allows users to by-pass Google 's controversial Search Plus Your World feature . The 'focus on the user ' project which is compatible with Chrome , IE and Firefox replaces the Google+ inspired results with more prominent results from the social web . The fix is made possible by a piece of code , or bookmarklet , called `` do n't be evil '' written by Ross and a team of engineers over the weekend . Now , by dragging the bookmarklet into your bookmarks bar , you can update the Google+ social search results with more important links from the likes of Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , Foursquare and Tumblr . Google+ content will remain part of the process , but social results are shown in a more organic heirarchy based on Google 's own algorithms with no bias to any one service . The aim of the project , which Blake and his team created independently of Facebook , is to prove that Google can be more inclusive with its Search Plus Your World feature , which has sparked controversy and anger across the web . The search giant had said that it has prioritised results from G+ , despite Facebook and Twitter entries being far more popular , as it was n't able to get enough data from those social networks . The 'focus on the user ' project shows otherwise . You can see a demonstration of the project in the video below and also find out how to get it . Via : AllThingsD

Facebook is looking to sever its ties with YouTube and jump on the Vevo bandwagon . This is according to a number of sources which believe that Facebook is looking to stop using YouTube for video views and move over to the more label-friendly Vevo . While it trails YouTube by some way in terms of numbers ( 43 million compared to 130 million ) , the company is owned by Sony Music Entertainment , Universal Music Group and EMI which makes it the more desirable base for music videos . And it is the music video that Facebook wants to utilise in its all-new Timeline feature , with the idea being that music videos become part of the site 's social interaction . It seems to be a natural progression from the recently introduced 'listen with ' feature it has with Spotify and other music apps – where users can listen to music at the same time . With Vevo it would obviously be 'watch with ' . Neither Facebook or Vevo have denied or confirmed that talks have been taking place but video does seem to be the next big push for Facebook , now that its music offering is out there and by all accounts flourishing . If it is dropped from Facebook , it will be a blow for Google and YouTube . After a messy copyright-infringed start , the site has been pulled up by its bootstraps and is now making a significant amount of money for the major labels . This is n't the same as being owned by the labels , though , and this is something Vevo has in its favour despite being just two years old .

The release of 60 new apps for Facebook this week is a major win for developers but not so much the people that really count : the users of Facebook . There have been countless redesigns of the Facebook homepage of late and all of these have been to make sure that the site returns to the clutter-free experience it once was . Why ? Well , this was essentially Facebook 's USP when it looked to take on the garishness of MySpace – it used the KISS ( keep it simple , stupid ) approach and users loved its clean yet functional layout . Facebook 's designers have tried their hardest to make the current info-heavy Facebook layout clean but what they have really done is tidied up the homepage like a teenager tidies his bedroom – stuff the clutter in the corner of the room and hope the parents do n't notice when they eventually muster up the courage to inspect their hovel . And now with the launch of 60 more apps for users to sign up to , there 's a distinct Mr Creosote feeling about Facebook and its app overload – something 's got to go and it wo n't be the apps but the users themselves . I completely understand why Facebook wants more and more apps to tap into the social network and why devs are clambering over themselves to get on to Zuckerberg 's site . It 's a win-win situation : the more sites and services that offer their content on Facebook , the more chance Facebook has of becoming everyone 's homepage – it wants you to access and find content through its low-walled garden and for you to turn your back on Google . From a development point of view , if devs and brands can get hold of Facebook 's user data then they have hit data-mining gold . But , for the humble social networker more people signing up to apps means sifting through more white noise mundanity about what other people are doing . For instance , FoodSpotting allows you to tell all about your food habits , Rotten Tomatoes about your movie habits and TicketMaster allows you to tell all about your gigging habits . Times this by ( potentially ) 60 , then times it by the number of Facebook friends and what you have is data overload . Personally I ca n't wait until someone launches a Facebook app within Facebook Inception-style which emulates the Facebook of yore without all this app shenanigans . Then all you 'll get from me is an update or two about the people I poked .
Facebook has opened up its Open Graph platform to 60 new partners including Ticketmaster , Urbanspoon and RunKeeper . The Open Graph system pulls data into Facebook from other apps and social networks . From now on , Facebook is open to all public app submissions , meaning we should see plenty of activity as developers get to grips with the new functionality . Rather than just liking , sharing or commenting , users now have a whole host of app-specific actions which can be fed into their timeline . Facebook explains the idea by boiling it down to `` user–action–object '' . For example Kate ( user ) ran ( action ) an 8.7km route ( object ) or Marc ( user ) cooked ( action ) pilchard custard ( object ) . Each app can specify its own actions which , somewhat worryingly for the English language , could well lead to some interesting uses of verbs and creation of new , app-specific ones . Mike Vernal , the Facebook Platform 's Director of Engineering has told The Verge that Open Graph `` mashups '' will also be possible , allowing information exchange between apps for more sophisticated behaviour . For example , offsetting the calories logged by a food app with ones burned during exercise . Some of the apps are already available to add to your Facebook timeline – you can check them out here .

Facebook will debut a host of new 'Open Graph ' apps at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday , according to reports . The social network unveiled the first stable of fully-integrated apps back in September , with the likes of Spotify , the Guardian and Netflix among the founders . The `` watch , '' `` listen '' and `` read '' apps are created by third-party content providers and report the user 's activities on other web portals , back to their Facebook profile and bring in content from friends . The idea , from Facebook 's perspective , is to make itself the only website that its members need to visit in order to access music , television , news and a host more entertainment content . AllThingsD says the next generation of Open Graph apps will come on Wednesday with many developers simply waiting on Facebook to pull the trigger . Facebook has not commented on the report , but the article claims new verbs like `` cooked '' or `` ran '' might be added into the mix through work-out and cookery sites . AllThingsD also reckons that the site may require users to upgrade to the new Timeline profile as early as next week . All will be revealed at the media event in San Fransisco on Wednesday evening .

The next version of iOS 5 may include deep Facebook integration after references to the social network were uncovered in the latest developer build . The iMore website have done a little digging around iOS 5.1 Beta 3 and discovered the presence of Facebook within the contacts app , alongside Twitter . The screenshot could represent `` legacy code '' according to iMore , or could spell full-integration in iOS 5 or perhaps iOS 6 . Baked-in Facebook could give iOS users the opportunity to direct upload photos to the social network , while easier status updates would surely be included Twitter was , of course , baked-in to iOS 5 , while Facebook was left out when the two sides were unable to come to an agreement . Rumour and speculation would have us believe that this decision led to more friction between the two companies , which began when Apple launched the iTunes Ping social network .
Facebook will file for an IPO in May , ahead of full listing on the stock market later this year , according to AllThingsD . The long-anticipated floatation could raise up to $ 10 billion for the social network on a company valuation of $ 100 billion . In order to make that possible , Facebook must first file for an Initial Public Offering with the Securities and Exchanges Commission and AllThingsD 's `` multiple sources '' say that is imminent . From there , it may take three or four months , for Facebook to get approval for a full floatation on the stock market . Recent events may have led to a little more urgency in Facebook 's long-in-the-works desire to go public . Facebook has been criticised in investment circles for not fully cashing-in on its 800 million members . Also , as AllThingsD points out , Google 's decision to integrate Google+ into its search results , rather than other social networks , may damage Facebook , so an injection of cash from Wall Street would be most welcome . The report also points out that the date of the IPO filing could change `` in a New York minute . ''

Featured stories are set to invade your Facebook news feed as the social network rolls out more intrusive advertising . It 's not all completely awful though , since you 'll only be seeing adverts from brands whose official page you 've liked . Theoretically that should mean you do n't see any adverts you 're not actually interested in , but you may want to go and unlike Heinz Baked Beans and anything else you liked in a semi-ironic fashion . What 's more , advertisers wo n't be able to add to the posts once they 're in your news feed . However , it 's only set to grow more and more obvious that you 're receiving adverts on the site - for now , you 'll only see one ad per day , but this is set to grow . The wording is a little ambiguous , though - using 'featured ' rather than 'sponsored ' makes each advert sound more editorial than advertorial . Facebook defended the move , saying , `` We are using the term 'featured ' because we want to make it clear to people that they 're seeing content from a Page or person they have chosen to connect to .

Facebook has announced it is bringing Timeline to branded pages , with Manchester United , Dove and Burberry announced as launch partners . Just like Timeline for people , the brand Timeline allows you to check out the history of a brand . This may not be that interesting for some brands , but the Manchester United one shows the football club 's 134-year history and pulls out significant events from those years . No , Barthez is n't on there . `` Facebook Pages are mission control for brands on Facebook , enabling businesses , public figures , organisations and charities to connect with their communities . With features like cover photo and Page timeline , Pages tell a story to people with dynamic content and engaging images , '' said Facebook about the rollout . There 's five updates in all , these are : the Cover Photo , the Timeline for Pages Admin panel , Friend activity and Activity log . The new Facebook Pages will be automatically rolled out by 31 March , so administrators have until then to get their pages in order . It 's an interesting idea for Facebook and one brands with a lot of history will be able to utilise . It would be great to see someone like Guinness use Pages as a place to showcase its iconic advertising over the years . Not so great for a company like Zynga , which was n't even a blink in its mother 's eye five years ago .

If Facebook has been built today it would have been a mobile app rather than a website , according to the company 's CTO Bret Taylor . Facebook established itself online , but the rise of mobile devices has seen the social network embrace the brave new world and Facebook apps are among the most downloaded on the planet . According to the Telegraph Taylor said : `` Facebook would have been a mobile application if the technology had been available when Mark Zuckerberg was building it in his dorm room . '' Facebook is not the first to talk about the increased role of the mobile device in our everyday connected lives . Google has been clear in its stance on mobile , and Apple 's Steve Jobs famously talked up the post-PC world as he oversaw the meteoric rise of the iPad . `` [ Mobile ] devices are the best devices for Facebook , '' added Taylor . `` Now all the things that were already popular are much easier , from photosharing to posting a status update . `` Over time it 's pretty reasonable to expect that there will be a lot of things that are possible that just are n't possible on laptops . '' Via Telegraph
Yahoo has claimed that Facebook infringes on its patents , and is asking the social networking giant to either license its technology or face legal action . Although Yahoo is a waning force on the global internet market it still holds some crucial IP rights ; something that could prove problematic for Facebook . In a statement Yahoo wrote : `` Yahoo has a responsibility to its shareholders , employees and other stakeholders to protect its intellectual property . `` We must insist that Facebook either enter into a licensing agreement or we will be compelled to move forward unilaterally to protect our rights . '' The timing , just ahead of Facebook 's initial public offering , is likely no coincidence ; with Yahoo potentially earning shares in the company that could prove hugely profitable . However , a course told the Financial Times that this was not a similar situation to the one that saw Yahoo earn Google shares ahead of its own IPO through a patent claim . Instead , the timing is more to do with the arrival of new chief executive Scott Thompson . Thompson was brought in to steady the Yahoo ship , which has been taking on water for some time . Yahoo was once the foremost player in search , a crown now held by Google , and remains a powerful media hub , but a decision to avoid a $ 47 billion merger with Microsoft is now seen as a critical mistake for the company . Interestingly , back in October 2011 Google was linked with a move to buy out Yahoo , and a significant stake in Facebook would make it a much riper fruit for the plucking . Via FT ( £ )

The Sunday Times has alleged that Facebook has been reading users ' text messages . In the report , the paper claims that Facebook `` admitted '' to reading text messages via the Facebook mobile app during testing prodedures for a new messaging service . The latest privacy furore comes in the wake of the Path address book uploading and Google 's browser security measure evasion . Facebook responded to the Sunday Times ' allegation , telling Business Insider the following : `` There is no reading of user text messages . `` On the Android App store , the Facebook app permissions include SMS read/write . `` The reason it is on there is because we have done some testing ( not with the general public ) of products that require the SMS part of the phone to talk to the Facebook App . That 's what the read & write refers to – the line of communication needed to integrate the two things . `` Lots of communications apps use these permissions . Think of all those apps that act as replacements to the build-in sms software . `` That 's not necessarily what we 're working on . SMS can be used for carrier billing ( where users opt to pay for things like apps through their phone bill ) . Again – that 's not to say we 're launching this . It 's just an example of why an app might use these permissions . The Sunday Times leap to the conclusion that is was a messaging feature . `` Anyway – we have yet to make any such features available to the public . ( so the Sunday Times is completely wrong when it says Facebook is reading people 's SMS . Wrong on the terminology , and wrong on the suggestion that it has been implemented ) . The company finishes its statement by agreeing that it is right that the SMS access permission is flagged up on Android phones before installation : `` Facebook is right to insert this into the Android app permissions – because yes , the app technically has the capability to integrate with the phone 's SMS system – even if that is just for our own testing . '' So at least Facebook asks for access to text messages when its app is downloaded , but as users become more wary of what information they are giving up to apps , companies could start to think twice about asking users to lay bare their mobiles for the sake of a spot of testing .

A software development student from York has been jailed for eight months for hacking into Facebook , claiming he wanted to help the social network to improve its security . 26-year-old Glenn Mangham admitted accessing the account of a holidaying Facebook employee in June 2011 , prompting fears in the US that the company was had fallen victim to industrial espionage . Mangham claimed he had previously assisted Yahoo and was hoping to do the same for Facebook . He told Southwark crown court his actions were `` to identify vulnerabilities in the system so I could compile a report that I could then bundle over to Facebook and show them what was wrong with their system . '' However , the prosecution disagreed with the student 's `` ethical hacking '' defense , claiming he stole invaluable intellectual property from the social network . Prosecutor lawyer Sandip Patel said : `` He acted with determination and undoubted ingenuity and it was sophisticated , it was calculating . `` This represents the most extensive and grave incident of social media hacking to be brought before the British courts . '' Presiding over the case , Judge McCreath told Mangham that his actions , which were picked up by Facebook and reported to the FBI , were not that of 'harmless experimentation . ' He said : `` I acknowledge also that you never intended to pass any information you got through these criminal offences to anyone else and you never did so , and I acknowledge that you never intended to make any financial gain for yourself from these offences . '' `` But this was not just a bit of harmless experimentation . You accessed the very heart of the system of an international business of massive size , so this was not just fiddling about in the business records of some tiny business of no great importance . ''

Google , Facebook and other advertising networks have been caught using a workaround to circumvent security settings on Apple 's Safari and Safari Mobile browsers . The workaround enables them to deposit cookies on a user 's computer , regardless of whether the browser is set to prevent it . By default , Safari is set to only accept cookies from directly visited sites , blocking cookies from all others . It 's thought that Google wanted to get around this because it interfered with its +1 recommendation system . The exploit used was first spotted in 2010 by developer Anant Garg , while Google 's use of it was caught by Jonathan Mayer , a researcher at Stanford University . Google has reportedly now ceased using the trick , but claims that the Wall Street Journal , which drew attention to the practice , was misrepresenting the facts . Google said : `` We used known Safari functionality to provide features that signed-in Google users had enabled . It 's important to stress that these advertising cookies do not collect personal information . '' The WSJ found that the exploit was also used by Facebook and at least three advertising networks . Google and Facebook use it mainly to avoid repeated log-in requests . Meanwhile Apple said , `` we are working to put a stop '' to the practice . WSJ via The Verge

Facebook is to roll out a new verification service for celebrities on the site , offering them the chance to use a nickname if they so wish . Unlike Twitter 's verification service , there wo n't be any badges given to verified accounts but if the account is verified then the user will have much more control over it . It will also mean that their profile on the site is expanded , with verified users appearing more in Facebook 's 'People to Subscribe To ' lists . According to TechCrunch , the initial rollout of verified accounts will be chosen by Facebook so it wo n't be something you can request at first , even if you think yourself famous enough . To get verified , a user will have to upload some sort of ID like a passport or driving licence . Once this is uploaded and then verified , Facebook said it would dispose of the information immediately . The verification move comes a good three years after Twitter began rolling out its verified accounts – although when a fake Wendi Deng Murdoch account was verified in January it did seem to ridicule the whole system . Facebook is said to be looking closely at what pseudonyms will be used on the site . If a celebrity goes by a different moniker , such as Marshall Mathers as Eminem , then this will be allowed . But apparently you just ca n't go and give yourself a new nickname . So no Bo-Jo for Boris Johnson , then .

Love may have been in the air yesterday but it has been swiftly replaced with fun . Lots of fun and tech . That 's because TechRadar 's daily news in brief is here - the perfect antitodote to your romantic hangover . Here are 10 stories to help you forget that nagging feeling that you got royally ripped off by the man selling you roses in the petrol station last night . Pap-top – Fancy having a laptop but have an irrational fear of plastic or aluminium ? Then fear not , as a laptop made out of paper has been created . It 's being touted as the most environmentally friendly laptop around and it is cheap too . Sounds great , if a little Blue Peter-esque for our liking . ( Fastcoexist ) Erase you up – A new app called Remove has been developed which can erase wandering people from the backgrounds of photos . Created by Scalado , it is in prototype stage at the moment so you 'll still have to shout at any passer-by that unwittingly gets in your shots but it should be ready in the coming months . Now if only they developed an app that does this to real life… ( GizMag ) Do n't forget your toothbrush – Cleaning your teeth just got that little bit more techy with the launch of the Beam Brush – a toothbrush that is connected to an app . The app tells you if you have done the right amount of brushing and will log your tooth-based habits . It 's the first time anything like this has been done so we are expecting the device to have a few teething troubles . Arf arf . ( Gizmodo ) Cold shoulder – The Samsung Galaxy S2 has come out top in a cold endurance test for smartphones , with the handset managing to withstand temperatures of -20°C and only conking out after -35°C . Now that 's what we call cold calling . [ PR ] Twitter data face-palm – Twitter has been a touch naughty with the data it receives , admitting it will store you and your friends contact details for 18 months – including phone numbers and emails . Twitter said it wants to be transparent about the whole thing and will change the wording of how it uploads your contacts in an upcoming app update . Tut tut . [ Zdnet ] The price is not right – Sony has admitted that it made a mistake in hiking up the price of two of Whitney Houston 's albums after the singer 's death . It has also apologized for any offence caused . As we are in the habit of tutting , this one deserves a big three tuts . Tut tut tut . [ NY Times ] Women love Facebook – Women are the most likely to use Facebook , while men love a bit of Foursquare . No this is not a euphemism , but a study into social networking habits of those wonderful things called human beings . [ The Next Web ] RIP RNB – SOCA has shutdown the website rnbxclusive.com for alleged copyright infringement and posted a rather nasty notice on the homepage explaining that `` SOCA has the capability to monitor and investigate you , and can inform your internet service provider of these infringements '' . Just because you 're paranoid does n't mean they 're not after you . [ BBC Tech ] YouTube defines funny – If you want to know what 's funny , then head over to YouTube 's blog and you 'll be in stitches . This is because the site is trying to understand what is perhaps the most subjective video category around – comedy . Apparently , it 's all to do with how many o 's the Lols have in comments . Nope , we have no idea either . [ YouTube ] Gaming ends marriages – If you play games and are married ( not many , we know ) then you may want to avoid MMORPGs from now on . Not because they have the clumsiest acronym ever but because they lead to marital dissatisfaction . There is an easy way to fix this – just marry an orc . [ Wired ]

It 's Friday which means you are quite possibly looking for things on the internet to wile away that seemingly endless time before the working week ends and the weekend begins . Well , you are in luck as enclosed in this article are not one but 10 , yes 10 , news stories from the world of technology that have made us smile – and a smile from a hard-nosed tech journo is as rare as a Googlewhack , so you better enjoy . Facebook smackdown – It used to be that a teenager could diss their parents behind their backs without them ever finding out but in this wonderful world of social networks , nothing is private . A girl from North Carolina found this out the hard way when she updated her Facebook status with a rather irate comment , only for her dad to take matters into his own hands by smashing up her laptop and filming the whole thing . We 're praying that she does n't ever get caught for smoking – if she does , we 're betting there will be a flame thrower involved . [ TheNextWeb ] A brand do n't come for free – High-street clothes horse H & M has managed to get itself to the top of the most-followed brands list on Google+ . The reason might have something has everything to do with David Beckham in his pants . [ SlashGear ] Toy talk – Zynga , the maker of Farmville , is branching out into toy production by enlisting Hasbro to create the cuddly characters from its games . This is in no way like Rovi teaming up with Mattel to make Angry Birds . None at all . [ SlashGear ] Manchester City , big in Japan – Man City is looking to give something back to its international fan base by building a bespoke mobile website purely for fans in Japan . The site will give access to club data , merchandising and memorabilia . It will also come complete with a Where 's Carlos Tevez game , which is a bit like Where 's Wally except that you can always find him on the bench . [ Reuters ] Google gone – The first-ever official employee of Google , Craig Silverstein , has announced that he is set to leave the company . He is off to something called the Khan Academy – where he has been tasked with watching Star Trek 2 over and over and over again . Probably . [ All Things Digital ] Bluetooth gains muscle – the good folk behind Bluetooth have announced a new division of the company that will focus on fitness gadgets . This means that we will be seeing a lot more devices with Bluetooth functionality that will make us all that little bit fit… sorry , we had to wipe some doughnut jam off the keyboard while writing that . [ Engadget ] BBC troll – The BBC managed to peek under the filthy duvet of the strange world of internet trolling this week and tracked down one web user who could n't stop writing poisoned pen missives.Unsurprisingly , the man they unmasked as being an internet troll is as every bit as vile as you would expect him to be . [ CNET ] Apple 's not all white – Apple has finally killed off its white Macbook range , ending the company 's iconic association with the colour white . In memory of the colour white , the whole of the UK was covered in snow as a tribute . Yes , Apple has the power to do this , even if it has now gone to the Dark Side . [ The Verge ] Obama sing-a-long – President Obama may be in the middle of a campaign to stay in the White House but that has n't stopped him taking time out to create a Spotify playlist to go alongside his electioneering . Songs of note on the playlist includes a little bit of indie ( 'You 've Got The Love ' by Florence and the rest of the Magic Roundabout ) some soul ( 'Let 's Stay Together ' by Al Green - unfortunately not Obama 's version ) and some British prog rock in the form of 'Mr Bright Sky ' by ELO . Groovy . [ Spotify ] Mobile Donkey – Old school PC gamers can rejoice as Donkey , the first ever PC game , has landed on the iTunes Store . Donkey may not be as graphically intense as other games on iOS but it 's full of 8-bit charm and well worth a few of your hard-earned pence . [ Apple ]

All hail the new king of tech ! After months of speculation , Facebook 's becoming a public company : the social network will be looking to raise $ 5 billion later this year in a share offering that could value the firm at as much as $ 100 billion . As you might imagine , founder Mark Zuckerberg was in triumphant mood . `` You 're all my bitches now ! '' he crowed , announcing a host of new features that will share your most shameful secrets with everybody you 've ever met and everybody the people you 've ever met have ever met . Okay , he did n't , but he did write a letter . `` You 're all my - '' Only kidding . His letter explains that , despite what you might think , Facebook was never about money . It 's all about bringing people together . Facebook `` was built to accomplish a social mission — to make the world more open and connected . '' Also , we 've always been at war with Eurasia . Facebook 's IPO will make Zuckerberg very rich , but what will it do for the rest of us ? Kate Solomon says everything 's doomed . DOOMED ! `` Going public will mean it has to answer to outside shareholders who do n't give a hoot about Facebook itself as long as the revenue comes flooding in , '' she says . `` You might not notice it at first , you might not notice it for a year , but as far as Facebook goes , the glory days are behind us . It 's all downhill into corporate doom and marketing speak from here on out . '' For now , though , Facebook 's star is in the ascendant - but other tech empires appear to be crumbling . Sony 's latest financial results reported a whopping 24 % decline in consumer sales , mainly due to poor TV sales , and reduced its forecasts for sales of digital cameras and PS3s . Sony has also announced a new king : CEO Howard Stringer is being replaced by current acting vice president Kazuo Hirai . Maybe Sony should take a leaf out of rising tablet star Amazon , whose massive tablet sales have been achieved through the clever tactic of allegedly losing money on every sale . Amazon 's in it for the long term , which is just as well , as its latest figures are n't brilliant . The firm sold twice as many Kindles in 2011 as it did in 2010 , but profits have slumped . The firm is being cagey about how many Kindle Fires it 's sold , too : while analysts suggest the number could be as high as 6 million , Amazon 's keeping schtum . It 's not being very precise about its future either : in the first quarter of 2012 , Amazon says , it 'll either make a profit of $ 100 million or a loss of $ 200 million . Or maybe something else . Who knows ? Not Amazon . Could fixed-line ISPs ' empires be next in the firing line ? Probably not , despite bright ideas such as Three 's brilliantly named Web Cube . Instead of a traditional broadband connection with minimum contract terms and phone line rental , the Web Cube uses Three 's network to deliver a Wi-Fi access point that is n't tied to a particular building . The Web Cube is n't particularly fast - 10Mbps is a potential maximum - but then , it seems our fixed line broadband is n't much better . Telecoms watchdog Ofcom says that many of us are getting crappy connections instead of blistering broadband speeds . Part of the problem , it seems , is us : we 're not all taking advantage of the fastest services around . `` More than 4 in 10 broadband consumers remain on packages with speeds of 10Mbps or less even though many of them would be able to get a higher speed at little or no extra cost if they switched package or provider , '' Ofcom says . Even when we do switch , though , we continue to get considerably less than the speeds ISPs tell us we 'll get - the UK average has barely cracked 7Mb , whereas the average speed advertised by ISPs is eleventy billion Mbps .

Mark Zuckerberg announced this week that Facebook was finally going public . With the social network now filing for an IPO and looking to raise around $ 5 billion in cash , it 's clear that the site is no longer the cuddly social network it once was . Now it is a legitimate business which is setting out to change the face of the internet forever and line investors ' pockets in the process . With the filing of an IPO , Zuckerberg penned a lengthy letter to investors which outlined just what Facebook is about and how it wo n't change even when it floats on the stock market . TechRadar has read the letter , wiped the tears from its eyes – tears of sadness that we will never be able to afford Facebook shares – and here are the 10 things we think that the letter teaches us about Facebook . The Social Network may have implied that Zuckerberg 's main reason for creating Facebook was to impress the ladies but Zuck sees it differently , writing : `` Facebook was not originally created to be a company . It was built to accomplish a social mission – to make the world more open and connected . '' And if getting a girlfriend was a bi-product of this more open and connected world , then so be it . When Gutenberg ( Johannes , not Steve ) created the printing press , we 're guessing he had no idea that one day his machine would inspire humans to poke each other and let the world know what they were listening to . But , according to Zuckerberg , this is where the idea of Facebook stemmed from . `` At Facebook , we 're inspired by technologies that have revolutionised how people spread and consume information . `` We often talk about inventions like the printing press and the television – by simply making communication more efficient , they led to a complete transformation of many important parts of society . They gave more people a voice . They encouraged progress . They changed the way society was organised . They brought us closer together . '' They also brought us the Daily Mail and Jeremy Kyle , so it 's not all good . To paraphrase Notting Hill , Zuckerberg was just a boy , standing in front of a screen , asking it to love him before Facebook came along . Then when he created the site he found that he could actually make contact with other people . Still through a screen , but they were definitely real . And this is at the heart of Facebook , according to the letter . `` We hope to strengthen how people relate to each other . Even if our mission sounds big , it starts small – with the relationship between two people . `` Personal relationships are the fundamental unit of our society . Relationships are how we discover new ideas , understand our world and ultimately derive long-term happiness . '' Someone pass the sick bag . The world 's economy is screwed because the banks have been playing with real cash like it were a game of Monopoly . But do n't worry as Facebook is here to save the day . `` We hope to improve how people connect to businesses and the economy , '' stated the letter . `` We think a more open and connected world will help create a stronger economy with more authentic businesses that build better products and services . `` As people share more , they have access to more opinions from the people they trust about the products and services they use . This makes it easier to discover the best products and improve the quality and efficiency of their lives . '' Hopefully if Fred Goodwin is reading this , then it will remind him to change his Facebook status from 'knight of the realm ' to 'no longer friends with the Queen ' . Not content with being the Robin Hood of the tech world and bringing money back to the people , Zuckerberg also wants to make governments more honest . `` We hope to change how people relate to their governments and social institutions , '' Zuck explained . `` We believe building tools to help people share can bring a more honest and transparent dialogue around government that could lead to more direct empowerment of people , more accountability for officials and better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time . '' Zuckerberg is a paper billionaire and everyone associated with Facebook is about to be a little richer but making money is n't the real reason behind going public . Well , it is but this money is going to go straight back into the development of Facebook . `` Simply put : we do n't build services to make money ; we make money to build better services , '' wrote Zuckerberg . `` And we think this is a good way to build something . These days I think more and more people want to use services from companies that believe in something beyond simply maximizing profits . '' Zuckerberg is taking Facebook public to say thanks to those who made it a success . No , not the Winklevoss twins , silly – the people who are working at the company now . `` We 're going public for our employees and our investors . We made a commitment to them when we gave them equity that we 'd work hard to make it worth a lot and make it liquid , and this IPO is fulfilling our commitment . `` As we become a public company , we 're making a similar commitment to our new investors and we will work just as hard to fulfil it . '' Staying close to his coding roots , Zuckerberg used a significant chunk of his letter to tell his investors that hacking is a good thing and Facebook was built upon the ethic of letting coders do what they want . We 're thinking this was n't an invite to Anonymous to DDoS the site on a regular basis , more like pointing out that hacking can be good as well as bad . `` The word `` hacker '' has an unfairly negative connotation from being portrayed in the media as people who break into computers . In reality , hacking just means building something quickly or testing the boundaries of what can be done . Like most things , it can be used for good or bad , but the vast majority of hackers I 've met tend to be idealistic people who want to have a positive impact on the world . '' There 's a reason why Facebook updates its site and it gets a lot of negative feedback . This is because Zuckerberg stands by the idea that you have to break things to find out how they work . This is fine if you are a small startup but when you have billions of eyes on your site daily , someone is going to notice if something is borked – not that Zuckerberg seems to care . `` Moving fast enables us to build more things and learn faster . However , as most companies grow , they slow down too much because they 're more afraid of making mistakes than they are of losing opportunities by moving too slowly . We have a saying : 'Move fast and break things . ' The idea is that if you never break anything , you 're probably not moving fast enough . Stop tweaking your privacy settings people – let the world see what you are up to . Come on , this is the reason you tell all about your meaningless life on Facebook is n't it ? Well , even if you are not going to open up , Zuckerberg wants Facebook to be as open as possible . `` We believe that a more open world is a better world because people with more information can make better decisions and have a greater impact , '' explained the letter . `` That goes for running our company as well . We work hard to make sure everyone at Facebook has access to as much information as possible about every part of the company so they can make the best decisions and have the greatest impact . ''
Zynga and its peculiar brand of -ville suffixed games may once have been the bane of your Facebook news feed but the games earn Facebook $ 375 million ( £236.6 million ) a year through Facebook Credits . That 's 68 per cent of Facebook 's total $ 550 million ( £347 million ) income from Credits coming by way of Zynga , with the company also spending around $ 70 million ( £44.2 million ) on advertising on the social network . That 's a lot of , er , you know – farming equipment or whatever it is you buy in Farmville and its ilk . What this $ 445 million ( £280.8 million ) income amounts to is that Zynga makes up 12 per cent of Facebook 's total income , and that is huge . What if Zynga ditched the social network as some long-time rumours suggested it might ? Happily for Facebook , it signed a five-year deal with Zynga in 2010 so that revenue is n't going anywhere , for now at least . It 's pretty good news for Zynga too , which apparently makes $ 1.3 billion ( £820 million ) from its activities on Facebook every year , often taking more than traditional console games .
Facebook 's IPO filing contains a lengthy letter from founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg which outlines the company 's 'social mission ' and its goals for the future . The multi-page letter , which will be read by potential investors when FB goes public , says the social network was n't built to be a money-making company but a service to bring people together . Zuckerberg , who famously started Facebook from his Harvard University dorm and oversaw its growth to 800m members , said : `` Simply put : we do n't build services to make money ; we make money to build better services . '' The letter could be seen as a warning to would-be shareholders not to mistake Facebook 's forthcoming IPO for the company changing tact and putting stock dividends above the interests of its mission . Below is an excerpt of the letter sent to investors : `` Facebook was not originally created to be a company . It was built to accomplish a social mission — to make the world more open and connected . `` We think it 's important that everyone who invests in Facebook understands what this mission means to us , how we make decisions and why we do the things we do . I will try to outline our approach in this letter . `` At Facebook , we 're inspired by technologies that have revolutionized how people spread and consume information . We often talk about inventions like the printing press and the television — by simply making communication more efficient , they led to a complete transformation of many important parts of society . They gave more people a voice . They encouraged progress . They changed the way society was organized . They brought us closer together ... `` At Facebook , we build tools to help people connect with the people they want and share what they want , and by doing this we are extending people 's capacity to build and maintain relationships ... `` By helping people form these connections , we hope to rewire the way people spread and consume information ... `` We have already helped more than 800 million people map out more than 100 billion connections so far , and our goal is to help this rewiring accelerate ... `` We hope to improve how people connect to businesses and the economy . We think a more open and connected world will help create a stronger economy with more authentic businesses that build better products and services ... `` Our developer platform has already enabled hundreds of thousands of businesses to build higher-quality and more social products . We have seen disruptive new approaches in industries like games , music and news , and we expect to see similar disruption in more industries by new approaches that are social by design ... `` We believe building tools to help people share can bring a more honest and transparent dialogue around government that could lead to more direct empowerment of people , more accountability for officials and better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time . `` Facebook was not originally founded to be a company . We 've always cared primarily about our social mission , the services we 're building and the people who use them . This is a different approach for a public company to take , so I want to explain why I think it works ... `` I started off by writing the first version of Facebook myself because it was something I wanted to exist . Since then , most of the ideas and code that have gone into Facebook have come from the great people we 've attracted to our team ... `` Simply put : we do n't build services to make money ; we make money to build better services ... `` This is how we think about our IPO as well . We 're going public for our employees and our investors . We made a commitment to them when we gave them equity that we 'd work hard to make it worth a lot and make it liquid , and this IPO is fulfilling our commitment . As we become a public company , we 're making a similar commitment to our new investors and we will work just as hard to fulfill it .. `` Once again , Facebook exists to make the world more open and connected , and not just to build a company . We expect everyone at Facebook to focus every day on how to build real value for the world in everything they do ... `` We believe that we have an opportunity to have an important impact on the world and build a lasting company in the process . I look forward to building something great together . ''

After months of speculation , Facebook has officially filed for an IPO , paving the way for the company to become publicly traded for the first time . The social networking giant will seek to raise $ 5 billion in cash with an Initial Public Offering of shares later this year . The company , which now boasts over 800m members , did not specify the number of shares it will be offering or the price per share . The floatation could value the company at anywhere between $ 75 and $ 100 billion . The IPO will be managed by a host of US financial institutions with Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Bank of America Corp. , Barclays Plc and Allen & Co. all on board . Facebook going public will see the maverick company and its single-minded CEO Mark Zuckerberg answer to shareholders for the first time . However , if you think the Facebook IPO is simply a concern for the money men and has nothing to do with us simple 'end users ' then have a read of TechRadar 's Kate Solomon 's column on the end of Facebook as we know it . Facebook 's impending floatation on the stock market , which is n't likely to go through for next few months , makes it the latest in a series of high profile tech companies to begin selling shares . Daily deal service Groupon , professional networking service LinkedIn , social gaming site Zynga and internet radio company Pandora all made a public offering in 2011 . Will Twitter be next in line ?
Facebook 's believed to be going public , which means that Mark Zuckerberg and his company will be beholden to the stock market for the first time . What 's nice about the really successful tech start-ups , generally , is that the idea is the thing and the money is just a nice extra . Twitter , Spotify , Facebook , Tumblr ... sure , they might be schilling around for cash now but when they started , the end product was the focus to the point where there was no real money making game . That 's why they worked and that 's why we all flocked to them . Passion – that 's what makes a great product . Passion and straight-forward thinking . Know what the markets are passionate about ? Money . Money and then some more money . While Facebook is already working on swelling its coffers , going public will mean it has to answer to outside shareholders who do n't give a hoot about Facebook itself as long as the revenue comes flooding in . The pressure on Facebook to include ever more advertising will increase because if there 's one thing share holders universally demand , it 's a Y-axis filled with lots of big numbers and plot-points that move in a definite upward direction . And once you start making a lot of money , you have to keep making a lot of money . So more ads , more targeting , more mining of your personal inner-most desires and subconscious marketing intended to part you from your hard-earned cash . Obviously there 's no guarantee that Facebook will go advertising mad . At the moment , its adverts are fairly unobtrusive , and although you might get more from brands you 've 'liked ' , you can always unlike them and they 'll go away . How long before that stops being an option once the company has serious financial targets to meet ? What 's more , there 'll be new pressure to put Facebook 's vast database of user info ( that 's all the secrets you and I have unwittingly told the social network about our likes and dislikes ) to advertising work – and this will lead to ever more privacy concerns and a growing number of users ditching the service . Once public , Facebook 's actions will be scrutinised by financial analysts instead of just bloggers . Now , I 'm not one to knock financial analysts , but I 'm pretty sure the bloggers know more about what makes a good social network than they do , so what effect will this hard-nosed scrutiny have on Facebook itself ? Facebook apparently has an internal motto : `` Facebook 's only 1 % finished '' . Elegant it may not be , but it is admirable in a tech company . The constant tinkering with profile layouts and new features might annoy users at first , but it 's part of what 's kept Facebook alive where its competitors have failed . Of course , it can go too far – maybe up that percentage to 10 soon , Zuck – but it 's exciting . Having to answer to the markets could put an end to this kind of freewheeling experimentation . Any change that may impact its income in the short term is likely to be mercilessly abandoned – that kind of thinking is dangerous to a company that has always thrived on a hotch potch of new ideas . The similarities with Google are hard to ignore – before Google went public it came across as a cool young company that did what you needed it to and seemed to be sticking to its `` Do n't be evil '' motto . Now it has fingers in every pie going , aping other companies ' ideas and greedily Hoovering up any user info it can in order to increase its advertising revenue . Google Labs is out , Google+ is in . You might not notice it at first , you might not notice it for a year , but as far as Facebook goes , the glory days are behind us . It 's all downhill into corporate doom and marketing speak from here on out .

Facebook is in the process of updating its user agreement documents , in part to clarify its position on employers demanding job applicants ' log in details , but has also added a couple of sneaky additions . Now known as its Statement of Rights and Obligations , Facebook 's new user agreement is still being reviewed but includes a clause that it can store and process data on un-registered users who in any way interact with the site . Facebook wants `` non-users who interact with Facebook '' to agree to have their `` personal data transferred to and processed in the United States '' – but it 's not clear how these non-users who have n't signed up to Facebook can possibly give consent to these terms . For its part , Facebook says that not much has changed : `` Facebook is a social website and so is our platform . Apps need data from friends to develop these social experiences and that is the whole purpose for our platform . If you 're not comfortable with that , you can use your app settings to control what friends can share about you , block individual apps , or you can turn off the platform altogether , '' said Barry Schnitt , spokesperson for the social network Most other changes to the nine-page pdf document are fairly superficial , but there 's another pretty outrageous one : it requires that all Facebook users agree that Facebook owns the trademark for the word 'Book ' . We 're not averse to referring to Zuckerberg 's social network as the 'Book in our fruitier moments , but we 're not sure its claim is exactly rock solid – apparently there are these other objects filled with paper adorned with words and pictures that some people call books too . Just Wikipedia 'd these `` books '' ; it looks like they 've been around since , like , some time BC – a bit before Zuck 's time . It 's possible that Facebook merely means the suffix `` -book '' - but then we imagine Apple would have a little something to say about that too .

Facebook has released a statement over concerns that more and more employers are asking for access to its users ' private information , revealing that it may initiate legal action where necessary . The statement comes after reports in the US that employers , colleges and even government agencies are demanding job applicants hand over the passwords to their Facebook profiles . `` If you are a Facebook user , you should never have to share your password , let anyone access your account , or do anything that might jeopardise the security of your account or violate the privacy of your friends , '' explained Facebook , which has had its own problems with privacy in the past . `` We have worked really hard at Facebook to give you the tools to control who sees your information . `` As a user , you should n't be forced to share your private information and communications just to get a job . And as the friend of a user , you should n't have to worry that your private information or communications will be revealed to someone you do n't know and did n't intend to share with just because that user is looking for a job . '' The statement continues with Facebook explaining that it is ready to take the matter to courts if this is what it takes to stop institutions demanding access to private information . `` Facebook takes your privacy seriously . We 'll take action to protect the privacy and security of our users , whether by engaging policymakers or , where appropriate , by initiating legal action , including by shutting down applications that abuse their privileges . `` While we will continue to do our part , it is important that everyone on Facebook understands they have a right to keep their password to themselves , and we will do our best to protect that right .

Facebook has just been on an intellectual property shopping spree , paying IBM for 750 of its patents . The big stack of patents covers various `` software and networking '' technologies and is reported to have cost the social network hundreds of millions of dollars . The 750 new patents will be added to Facebook 's current haul of fewer than 60 US patents . This is still a relatively small number in the world of tech – last year Google popped strolled down the aisles at IBM and came back with its trolley laden with over 2,000 patents . A sizeable sweep of which the perma-tanned Dale Winton would no doubt approve . Facebook 's lack of patents could be seen as a point of weakness , leaving the company unable to defend itself against claims from other companies . A company the size of Facebook has plenty to lose . In fact the purchase of IBM 's patents comes just a week after Yahoo started legal proceedings against Facebook , claiming that : `` Facebook 's entire social network model , which allows users to create profiles for and connect with , among other things , persons and businesses , is based on Yahoo 's patented social networking technology . '' In total , Yahoo is claiming infringement of ten of its patents involving web advertising and user interaction . Whether Facebook has found anything to counter Yahoo in these new patents , or is just covering its back in other areas remains to be seen , but we 'll let you know the latest as the fur starts to fly .

Facebook has announced some big improvements to its photo-viewing experience , allowing for full-screen images displayed at a much higher resolution . The social network will showcase images at the highest possible resolution , which it claims to be up to four times larger than before - maxing out at 2048 x 2048 . Full-screen mode can be accessed by clicking an expand icon in the top right corner of the image , but that update only appears to be for Chrome and Firefox users . Facebook has been allowing hi-def photo uploads for a couple of years now , but is now actively encouraging members to showcase their imagery at the best resolution possible . The move is sure to increase the strain on Facebook 's servers as users upload better quality snaps . You wo n't see us complaining though . The improvements are starting to roll-out today .

Sometimes I wish I had the power of invisibility , and teleportation . No , not for that . Get your mind out of the gutter . I mean so I could see what goes on inside big tech firms ' boardrooms , like Yahoo 's . I imagine one of their recent conversations went something like this : EXEC 1 : First Google , now Facebook ! We 're getting stomped out there ! EXEC 2 : Nobody knows who we are any more ! My wife asked me who the hell I was last night ! EXEC 3 : We 're doomed ! DOOOOOOOMED ! EXEC 1 : Unless ... EXEC 2 : Unless ? EXEC 1 : Unless we kill Zuckerberg . EXEC 3 : Kill Zuckerberg ? EXEC 1 : Yeah . We kill Zuckerberg , put his head on a spike , send Google a photo , message on the bottom : YOU 'RE NEXT YOU GOOGLEY BAST -- EXEC 2 [ interrupting ] : -- Is n't that a bit , well , extreme ? EXEC 1 : Is it ? EXEC 3 : It is , a bit . I know ! Let 's tell everyone we invented Facebook and sue them ! They 'll have to give us cash or we 'll shut 'em down ! EXECS 1 & 2 : Shut 'em down ! Brilliant ! Have a bonus ! The result ? Yahoo 's suing Facebook because it reckons it invented social networking , and internets , and toast . Facebook is n't slow to adopt other people 's bright ideas , but Yahoo 's gone off on a mad one here . In an excellent analysis by PaidContent , it turns out that Yahoo reckons it invented personalised music stations , the ability to share items only with selected people , the customised home page , the ability to send messages to your friends , targeted advertising , mountain climbing , opera , the medium of dance and the hamster . Only some of those are made up . It 's yet another outbreak of patent trolling , a plague on the tech industry , and it 's nonsense : Facebook ca n't steal Yahoo 's bright ideas because Yahoo does n't appear to have any . My email inbox contains a great example : it 's my annual Flickr Pro renewal , and I 'm seriously wondering whether to bother because I suspect Yahoo 's going to bin the service sooner or later , irrespective of its promises . Flickr was , and should have remained , absolutely massive . Yahoo , as it often does , let it wither . Google killed it in search , Facebook in social , and the only idea it appears to have left is to get the lawyers in . The worst case scenario for Yahoo ? It does n't get any cash from Facebook and continues to slide into irrelevance . The best case ? It gets some cash from Facebook and continues to slide into irrelevance . As shiny-faced punch-magnet David Cameron once said of Tony Blair , `` you were the future , once '' .

We 're constantly hearing how Twitter and Facebook are the keys to driving website traffic , but new figures suggest the vast majority of adults are n't using those tools to keep up to date with news . Highly-paid SEO experts have gone to great lengths to inform humble reporters that a finely-tuned social networking strategy will automatically result in ballooning page views . However , PaidContent reports that only 9 per cent of adults are using the social networks `` often '' as part of their news consumption routine . The numbers come from the Pew research group , who surveyed 3,000 people and found that 36 per cent of people still pick up the majority of their online news by heading straight to websites or apps . Beyond that , 32 per cent of digital content viewers often get news by typing keywords into search engines , while 26 per cent prefer to go through a news organising website or app like Google News . The report does say that smartphone and tablet owners are far more likely to use Twitter and Facebook as a primary means of accessing the latest news . However , that number falls for users who rely solely on a laptop or desktop computer . Have the importance of Facebook and Twitter been overstated ? Twitter especially has become a vital tool for those looking for up-to-the-minute breaking news , but it 's clear that the majority of folks are n't relying on the service for reports .

OMGPOP 's Pictionary-inspired social drawing title Draw Something is now the most played game on Facebook . According to stats from tracking service AppData , the game is racking-up 10.8m daily users , comfortably beating its closest challenger Zynga 's Words With Friends , which has 8.6m every day . Draw Something 's social networking success follows its sharp rise to the top of the iOS and Android charts after hitting 20 million downloads just five weeks after it was released . The duality of its success on mobile and Facebook has arisen largely through allowing cross-platform challenges , during which users have to guess their pals ' touchscreen drawings . Just like Words With Friends and the official Scrabble game it pinched took inspiration from , iPhone players can take-on Facebook friends and vise-versa . The exceptional success of Words With Friends and Draw Something do prove one thing ; time tested games like Scrabble and Pictionary are still massive winners even though we rarely sit around and play the physical games . Hooray for the 21st century mediums keeping them alive and kicking . For Zynga , for so long the kingpin of the Facebook gaming arena , through titles like WWF , Farmville and Zynga Poker , its dethroning raises further questions about its long-term future on the social network . The company recently announced its own gaming portal , which will go head-to-head with Facebook and also encourage third party developers to submit their own titles . Via : TechCrunch

Yahoo has decided that it would be a good idea to sue Facebook because – get this – Yahoo actually came up with and patented the `` entire social network model '' . Yahoo 's lawsuit , which it first threatened Facebook with earlier this year , covers the Facebook news feed , advertising methods , messaging tools and even its sometime controversial privacy settings . `` Facebook 's entire social network model , which allows users to create profiles for and connect with , among other things , persons and businesses , is based on Yahoo 's patented social networking technology , '' Yahoo 's lawsuit reads . The search engine goes as far as to say that Facebook has been `` free riding '' on Yahoo 's patents for years , hinting that Yahoo wants a little more than just royalty payments – in fact , it wants triple damages as well as to stop Facebook using the patents altogether . It seems that Yahoo 's aggressive court-based tactics are n't sitting too well with its employees , with All Things D reporting that many `` top techies '' at Yahoo not in favour of the move . But newly minted CEO Scott Thompson appears to be driving the push , presumably for the cash and the handy side benefit of damaging Facebook 's IPO action . Facebook , meanwhile , is feeling sad , disappointed and betrayed : `` We 're disappointed that Yahoo , a longtime business partner of Facebook and a company that has substantially benefited from its association with Facebook , has decided to resort to litigation , '' the social network said in the statement . `` Once again , we learned of Yahoo 's decision simultaneously with the media . We will defend ourselves vigorously against these puzzling actions . '' First it was the Winklevoss twins ' idea , then it was Mark Zuckerberg 's , then it was some random New Yorker 's and now it turns out that Facebook was actually Yahoo 's idea all along . Hey , someone should make a film about this…

Facebook has announced a new Interest lists feature , which allows users to collate their favourite people and subjects and turn the news feed into a 'personalised newspaper . ' The Interest lists functionality , which will roll out to users in the next couple of weeks , seems to take inspiration from Twitter lists and socially-themed magazines like the Flipboard app for iOS . 'Interests ' are user-generated lists which bring together , for example , news from the Facebook Pages of every Premier League team or every tech news site into collective feeds . Whenever those are lists are updated , the stories or posts will appear also in your main news feed , making it easier for you to catch-up on the news that matters to you . `` Interests feature public figures and Pages related to a particular topic , and are put together by people like you . `` The top stories from each interest appear in your news feed so you can scan interesting headlines or click through to read more posts , '' says Facebook software engineer Eric Faller . When Facebook users subscribe to Interest Lists , that subject will appear on the left hand side of the page , beneath the Friends Lists functionality . While you can already subscribe to lists created by fellow Facebookers , for a true personalised experience , it 's probably best that you get in there and create your own . You can give Facebook Interest Lists a spin now before the official roll-out . Via : Mashable

Facebook has officially launched a Messenger desktop client for Windows PCs . The arrival of the standalone app , which was previewed late last year , follows the launch of chat-only apps for iPhone and Android smartphones . The main benefit for Windows users will be the opportunity to continue instant messaging with friends without bring sucked in by status updates , shared articles and endless YouTube videos of cute cats . However , as well as IM , it will bring the now-familiar Ticker interface meaning you can still tab to status updates , and Actions like 'listened to ' and 'watched ' . It also ends the frustration of chats curtailed by accidentally navigating away from the Facebook.com browser page . You 'll also get notifications if you desire them . Facebook says a Mac client is likely to arrive in the near future . Via : VentureBeat

Social gaming giant Zynga has announced the launch of its own portal , which will play host to Farmville , Words With Friends and the company 's other top titles . The new Zynga.com site represents the first time the billion dollar-valued company has independently toted its own line-up , allowing users to play games directly through the website . Traditionally the company has pushed its games through Facebook and smartphone apps and was recently revealed to be worth $ 445m in revenue to the social network . That 's around 12 per cent of Facebook 's total revenue With Facebook so reliant on increased profitability following its recent IPO , the thought of losing some Zynga gamers back to the company is unlikely to go down well with Zuckerberg 's crew . Beyond that , Zynga is also encouraging third party developers to get involved by submitting titles to the portal , something which will also create more of a rivalry with Facebook . The company will have its own social networking portion of Zynga.com , but will still use the Facebook Credits virtual currency and gamers will still have to log in through Facebook Connect to play . Further to that , Zynga says it has no plans to end the massively mutually beneficial relationship . Zynga CFO John Schappert said : `` We 've been a web/game company delivering content to our players and developing our own internal infrastructure and technology . And now we 're transforming into a gaming and platform company . `` We 've listened to our players , to what they want from social gaming . They want a place where they can play together , they want a place that curates and delivers the best new social games for them , where they 'll always have a friend to play with . ''

Facebook today struck a $ 550 million deal with Microsoft to purchase patents originally belonging to AOL . The deal includes 650 patents and 275 patent applications . The exact contents of the patents deal are not public , but are said to cover technology ranging from mobile services and advertising to cell phone handsets . Earlier this month , AOL sold more than 800 patents to Microsoft in a $ 1.056 billion deal . Sources say Microsoft always intended to sell off the patents , which originally had an estimated value closer to $ 290 million . Patents are often difficult to value , and with so many shifting hands it 's uncertain how much Microsoft benefitted from the deals . Though Microsoft issued a statement Monday saying the Facebook deal allowed it `` to recoup over half of our costs while achieving our goals from the AOL auction . '' Microsoft will retain licenses to the patents and applications sold to Facebook as per the deal 's terms . Patents are a hot commodity for technology companies , a fact that the social media giant realized earlier this year when Yahoo sued Facebook for infringement . Facebook in turn purchased 750 patents from IBM , and countersued Yahoo for infringing 10 of them . Given Facebook 's recent history of buying patents to cover its defense , it seems likely that at least a few of the AOL patents purchased from Microsoft will show up in the ongoing case with Yahoo as it progresses .
Facebook now has an astonishing 901 million active monthly members , which is up almost a third since the end of quarter one of 2011 , when it recorded 680m . The social network , which revealed an intriguing set of financials ahead of its planned IPO , will surely hit one billion active members within the next few months and almost certainly before the end of 2012 . 525m of those MUAs ( Monthly Users Active ) use the site on a daily basis . The S1 filing to the SEC ( Securities and Exchange Commission ) comes with the IPO rumoured to be happening on May 17 or May 24 . Revenue is up for Facebook , once again scaling the billion dollar mark to $ 1.06bn ( 650m ) , which is up from $ 731 million ( £453m ) this time last year . However , it 's slightly down on Q4 2011 . A number of factors , including rising marketing and R & D costs , resulted in a fall in profits from $ 233 million ( £144m ) to $ 205 million ( £127m ) . That profit would have been completely wiped out had Facebook 's purchase of Instagram happened prior to March 31st . The filing reveals that Mark Zuckerberg paid Instagram $ 300 million ( £186m ) in cash for the company , along with 23 million shares in Facebook . All in all , the purchase was valued at a billion dollars On the Instagram acquisition , the filing reads : `` Following the closing of this acquisition , we plan to maintain Instagram 's products as independent mobile applications to enhance our photos product offerings and to enable users to increase their levels of mobile engagement and photo sharing . '' Although , that 's nothing we did n't already know , had the deal not gone smoothly , it would have cost Facebook a $ 200 million break-up fee .

Google co-founder Sergey Brin has taken to Google+ to explain that his thoughts on the closed nature of Facebook and Apple 's ecosystems have been widely misunderstood . His original views were reported as part of an interview with the Guardian newspaper , which Brin now describes as `` a pretty good read but it is a short summary of a long discussion '' . He clarified his position on Apple and Facebook , admitting himself to be quite the Apple fan ( `` I am writing this post on an iMac and using an Apple keyboard I have cherished for the past seven years '' ) . Brin : `` Today , the primary threat by far to internet freedom is government filtering of political dissent . '' Brin explained , `` To clarify , I certainly do not think this [ walled garden ] issue is on a par with government based censorship . `` Both [ Facebook and Apple ] have made key contributions to the free flow of information around the world . '' His concern , he went on to explain , stems from the fact that Google , eBay , Yahoo and other first-wave web giants were able to make strides because of the open nature of the internet : `` Today , starting such a service would entail navigating a number of new tollbooths and gatekeepers . '' Brin 's reaction makes it clear that his main concern is with governmental control of the internet , which he describes as `` the primary threat '' : `` Today , the primary threat by far to internet freedom is government filtering of political dissent , '' he wrote . `` This has been far more effective than I ever imagined possible across a number of nations . In addition , other countries such as the US have come close to adopting very similar techniques in order to combat piracy and other vices . I believe these efforts have been misguided and dangerous . '' His impassioned conclusion reads : `` Regardless of how you feel about digital ecosystems or about Google , please do not take the free and open internet for granted from government intervention . `` To the extent that free flow of information threatens the powerful , those in power will seek to suppress it . '' From Google+

Twitter 's CEO Dick Costolo insists that the company wo n't be rushing to purchase an Instagram rival , despite reports that the company hoped to snap up the retro camera app before Facebook did . Speaking to reporters in Japan , Costolo explained that it 's no biggie , Twitter 's got its own strategy for this kind of thing , okay ? They do n't need no copycat service . `` I think that sometimes there is a tendency for companies to react to events in the marketplace that are inconsistent with their strategy , and I think that tendency is a mistake , '' he said , citing the video sharing sale frenzy that happened after Google bought YouTube . `` You can look at all sorts of other similar cases in the past when an event like this happens and people try to react to it . Copying it is never a good idea - at least history would say it 's not a good idea . `` We will make sure that we execute on the strategy that we have and not one that 's been laid down for us based on events that happen in the marketplace , '' he concluded . What he did n't add is whether or not that the strategy features buying a photosharing service like Instagram , which seemed on the cards until Monday April 9 2012 when Facebook dropped an outlandish $ 1 billion ( around £630 million ) on the app .

Jack Dorsey was an Instagram investor who made an absolute killing off the Facebook acquisition . But , if rumors are to be believed , he was less than happy about the acquisition . That 's because Jack Dorsey , who co-founded Twitter , had tried to acquire Instagram months before Facebook made a move . If it 's true , it 's not hard to imagine how it came to pass - nobody in Silicon Valley has the kind of muscle and reach Facebook does . Their billion dollar purchase of the photo sharing application has been met with mixed reaction , which has largely centered around the astronomical purchase price . It is unlikely that Dorsey would have matched that figure , though his early involvement in Instagram could have made the acquisition a personal matter . According to The New York Times : His company , according to several people briefed on the matter , had expressed interest in buying Instagram in recent months . Mr. Dorsey once used Instagram daily to send photos to Twitter , but he has not been back since the deal was announced , perhaps a sign that he is not happy to see it in the hands of a competitor . Twitter recently purchased the Tumblr rival Posterous . The purchase of a dedicated blogging site may have signaled a change or progression from Twitter 's infamously short-form messages . Similarly , Instagram may have been the vanguard of a change in the way Twitter handled sharing pictures . Unfortunately , we may now never know . You can follow Jack Dorsey on Twitter ( with the convenient handle @ Jack ) and decide for yourself what his conspicuous lack of Instagram photos means .
The restrictive rules put in place by companies like Facebook and Apple are threatening web freedom , according to Sergey Brin , one of Google 's co-founders . Speaking to The Guardian , Brin spoke of his fears for the internet as governments try to control it , militant anti-piracy measures threaten creativity and the growing trend for 'walled gardens ' like those patrolled by Facebook and Apple . `` Very powerful forces… have lined up against the open internet on all sides and around the world , '' he said in an interview . `` I am more worried than I have been in the past . It 's scary . '' Brin went on to criticise the walled gardens cultivated by networks like Facebook and proprietary systems like Apple 's App Store , saying that they fly in the face of Google 's openness and the standards it was built upon : `` You have to play by their rules , which are really restrictive . The kind of environment that we developed Google in , the reasons that we were able to develop a search engine , is the web was so open . Once you get too many rules , that will stifle innovation . '' At which point we were all `` Yeah ! Right on ! Peace and love ! ' - but then he said : `` There 's a lot to be lost . For example , all the information in apps – that data is not crawlable by web crawlers . You ca n't search it . '' Ah . Right . Placards down . This seems to suggest that Google thinks web freedom is the same as web searchability , something Google just so happens to have a vested interest in . That 's not quite what we had in mind .

The photography social networking site , 500px , has said that it does n't believe that it is in direct competition with Flickr or larger , more general social networking sites such as Facebook . Speaking to TechRadar , Oleg Gutsol , CEO of 500px said , `` There is a clear distinction between what we do and what Facebook does . We are building a community of people interested in photography , interested in learning and getting better at it , whereas Facebook , for example , focuses on connecting people . '' `` I think Facebook has a different purpose . I welcome the changes they recently made to their product , I think the photos really look better when they are presented bigger . '' 500px is often seen as the `` photographer 's social network '' , due to the high prevalence of enthusiast and professionals using the service . Flickr , the world 's biggest photo-sharing site , could be easily compared against 500px , but Gutsol does n't see it that way . `` I do n't think we are in direct competition with it . Yes , Flickr is a large and a well established photo community , but our focus and our goals are not identical to theirs . '' Recently , 500px went through a redesign ahead of Flickr 's own revamp . Increasingly photo-only social networking sites are being usurped by the likes of Facebook and Twitter , with people looking to use one site for multiple purposes . Facebook itself has redesigned the way it displays photos several times , with the most recent upgrade allowing images to be uploading in high resolution and displayed full screen .

Cloud gaming service Gaikai has announced that it has launched a beta version of its app through Facebook , promising console-quality gaming through the social network . Gaikai is currently going head to head with OnLive – with both services offering up an alternative to console and PC gaming . Using the cloud , you pay a subscription fee and they pipe content through your computer of set-top . Gaikai has pipped OnLive to the post when it comes to Facebook , though – with its creator David Perry noting how important the social network now is to the gaming world . `` People do n't want to leave Facebook to play games – Zynga 's phenomenal success is proof of that , '' explained Perry . `` Cloud Gaming means that the game does n't need to be downloaded and run on your computer , it literally means the game runs out on the internet , in the cloud , with the experience being streamed to the players . `` Most video game publishers are now seeking to grow their digital customer base and unlike movie and music services like Netflix and Spotify , Gaikai gives the game publishers relationships with the customers . '' Perry : `` Gaikai gives the game publishers relationships with the customers . '' For the app to work , Gaikai notes that you need Java installed and a broadband connection - once you have this then you will be able to start streaming demos straight away . You will need to sign up for the full games . `` The Facebook social graph fuels our mantra 'Try it for free ' , 'Share it if you like it ' , 'Buy it if you love it ' , '' explained Perry .

Social networking giant Facebook bought social photo-sharing giant Instagram yesterday for $ 1 billion . And , although Facebook users ' responses to CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's announcement of the news seem mainly positive , some sites report that Instagram users are already ditching the service en masse . In the announcement , Zuckerberg promised to focus on `` building on Instagram 's strengths and features rather than just trying to integrate everything into Facebook . '' But it seems many users are more concerned over Facebook 's dubious privacy policies . They 've tweeted messages like , `` I hate Facebook and the lack of privacy now I have to remove my pics before I ca n't , '' referring to Facebook 's well-known policy of making it notoriously difficult to delete your account ( though that 's no longer really the case ) . Another Twitter user said , `` You know what Instagram was missing ? Ads and privacy invasions . All it took was [ $ ] 1 billion dollars to make that happen . '' Facebook 's privacy woes Facebook 's privacy policies are constantly in flux . A major overhaul last year addressed some complaints , while a new policy introduced last month allows them to track the usage data even of users who are n't signed up for an account . That clause was seemingly snuck into an update meant to prevent snooping bosses from accessing employees ' profiles.\ Similar acquisitions have n't ended well TechRadar raised other concerns , asking whether Instagram 's future is similar to Flickr 's . That photo-sharing site was purchased by Yahoo ! in 2005 , and while it does n't appear that Google will go the way of Yahoo ! , Flickr has suffered due to its relationship with the waning company . And , Facebook 's previous social networking acquisitions — Gowalla , Snaptu , Beluga — have all ended in the purchased services being shut down permanently . Zuckerberg said he 's `` committed to building and growing Instagram independently , '' and Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom wrote yesterday , `` The Instagram app will still be the same one you know and love . '' However , despite all of those good intentions , the backlash has spurred other sites to post instructions on how to delete an Instagram account while preserving your photos , and other published reports claim that access to sites that perform that very function had slowed down yesterday due possibly to heavy use . Facebook could change terms at any time What 's more , experts such as the Center for Democracy and Technology 's Justin Brookman , claims that while photos and data already uploaded to Instagram remain subject to the service 's relatively sound privacy policies , `` for new data posted to Instagram , Facebook can set new terms . '' Of course , this is n't the first blow that Instagram has experienced in recent weeks . There was a significant backlash from iPhone users two weeks ago when the company released an Android version of its popular app . Those who remain with the service will likely soon find out exactly how Facebook 's influence will affect their experiences . Via : CNET

Facebook has just announced that it has bought the Instagram photo-sharing service for a cool $ 1 billion ( around £630 million ) . The shock acquisition comes just days after the filter-friendly application launched an Android app to sit alongside the iOS service , which has over 30 million users . The social networking giant will pay Instagram $ 1 billion in cash and stock from its upcoming IPO . The full team , including CEO Kevin Systrom will stay on . CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the deal on his Facebook page , saying hook-up will help to create the best possible experience for sharing mobile photos . Zuckerberg also said that Instagram will remain as a standalone service that Facebook is committed to developing as independent entity . He wrote : `` I 'm excited to share the news that we 've agreed to acquire Instagram and that their talented team will be joining Facebook . `` For years , we 've focused on building the best experience for sharing photos with your friends and family . Now , we 'll be able to work even more closely with the Instagram team to also offer the best experiences for sharing beautiful mobile photos with people based on your interests . `` We believe these are different experiences that complement each other . But in order to do this well , we need to be mindful about keeping and building on Instagram 's strengths and features rather than just trying to integrate everything into Facebook . `` That 's why we 're committed to building and growing Instagram independently . Millions of people around the world love the Instagram app and the brand associated with it , and our goal is to help spread this app and brand to even more people . '' In a post on the Instagram blog , Systrom moved to assure users that the app will remain separate with all of the features members love , while the team will continue to develop new features . He said : `` It 's important to be clear that Instagram is not going away . We 'll be working with Facebook to evolve Instagram and build the network . We 'll continue to add new features to the product and find new ways to create a better mobile photos experience . `` The Instagram app will still be the same one you know and love . You 'll still have all the same people you follow and that follow you . You 'll still be able to share to other social networks . And you 'll still have all the other features that make the app so fun and unique . `` We 're psyched to be joining Facebook and are excited to build a better Instagram for everyone . '' Instagram has become comfortably the most fashionable , and often the most simple way to edit and upload photos over the course of the last year or so . With a range of simple effects and filters giving photos a decidedly retro feel , snaps can be shared in just one click . The app , which grew from one million users in January 2011 to 15 million by the end of the year , and doubled again to 30m at the time of writing , was named App of the Year by Apple for 2011 . The newly-minted Android app obtained one million downloads in the first week .

Facebook has revealed that its open graph system for video apps is working well , offering up big numbers for those who view content through Facebook . The social-networking giant has outlined four video sites whose apps are getting mountains of clicks when a video goes viral . The sites outlined are Vevo , Viddy , Izlesene and Dailymotion . Given that only two of these are really well known in video circles ( Vevo and Dailymotion ) , the open graph seems to perk up apps even if they are n't exactly household names . Vevo , which has fully embraced Facebook and now filters all its registrations through the site , has seen `` exponential '' growth , according to Facebook . There 's been a 600 per cent rise in published content to Facebook through February to March and referrals from the site are up 130 per cent in the same timeframe . When it comes to Dailymotion , there 's now 2 million of its videos published on Facebook , while Viddy has become one of the most popular mobile apps on the Apple Store and has doubled its signings through opern graph . Turkish site Izlesene has seen a three-fold increase in video views . Speaking about video and the open graph , Alex Himel from Facebook said : `` Video apps [ have seen ] increased growth and engagement by building with the Open Graph and making it easier for people to share and discover videos on Facebook and their mobile devices . `` Early results show that as video clips go viral , so do the video apps and websites integrated with Open Graph .

Facebook has launched a counterclaim against Yahoo 's patent infringement lawsuit , using patents it has only just bought . Yahoo sued Facebook last month for infringing its patents , claiming : `` Facebook 's entire social network model … is based on Yahoo ! 's patented social networking technology . '' Rather than just refuting the claims it appears the social network has gone on the offensive , using recently bought patents to sue Yahoo right back . Facebook is now alleging infringements of 10 of its patents that cover Flickr , Yahoo 's homepage and various other pages from Yahoo 's site . The offending items include personalised story feeds , tagging digital media and user recommendation systems among others . Some of those patents have only just been acquired by Facebook , suggesting that the company bought them specifically for this case . It 's likely some of them could have come from the haul of 750 patents that Facebook bought from IBM last month . When Yahoo first sued Facebook , it was notable how few patents Facebook owned compared to its competitors , but a buying spree has since bridged that gap . Facebook has even gone a step further , arguing in its answer to Yahoo 's claim that it has `` an express and/or implied license under one of ( sic ) more of the patents-in-suit . '' In other words , their previous partnerships gave Facebook the right to use some of Yahoo 's patents . This one is sure to roll on for a while .

Facebook is set to bolster the search functionality on its site with a hope that users will ditch Google in favour of the social network . This is according to unnamed sources , which cite that Facebook has a number of people working on the new search functionality – one of which is an ex Google employee . Facebook is well known for keeping the amount of people working on its new features to a bare minimum . When it came to revamping its photo service , there were only a handful of people working on the project – and it is this type of working atmosphere which Facebook likes to feedback to other developers with its Facebook Garage events . So it is interesting that there 's said to be 24 people working on the new rumoured search functionality , and these are lead by former Google employee Lars Rasmussen . This is all according to Business Week , which reckons Facebook wants to utilise its mountains of information with better search controls . Although it is unlikely Facebook will reach the heady heights of Google 's search traffic , Facebook has slowly but surely started feeding the web Inception-like into its network . There are myriad apps out there that allow you to read content from papers within the site and this goes to listening to music as well . The dream for Facebook would be to free its social data with better search . This is something Google is trying at the moment with integrating its search with Google+ . This is proving difficult , though , because Google+ is n't embedded into people 's lives as much as Facebook is at the moment . The problem Facebook has , however , is the privacy controls on users ' accounts – which means that a revamped search function would only really be able to show results which a member of the social network has set to public . A Google-like search on Facebook would tap into the still young social search market . At the moment , the global search market is worth billions and Facebook will definitely want to tap into this revenue stream . If Business Week is correct and Facebook is looking to make everyone change their homepage from Google to the social network , then this could well be something that shakes up a search market that 's currently a one-horse race .

Like a `` deleted '' Facebook account , rumors of a Facebook phone - or `` FacePhone '' - persist . The latest guess regarding the social giant 's supposed efforts to create their own official Facebook smartphone comes from Paul Amsellem , managing director of mobile marketing company Mobile Network Group . Amsellem claims that Facebook could purchase Nokia , whose profits have been dropping , for $ 10 billion , and use the manufacturer 's existing expertise and partnerships to create the FacePhone within 18 months . Specifically , Nokia 's relationship with Microsoft would allow them to easily create a Facebook-branded Windows Phone . `` They need to do it , '' Amsellem said . But Recon Analytics ' mobile analyst Roger Entner told TechRadar that purchasing Nokia would be an `` over-the-top '' move for Facebook . `` You do n't need to buy , you know , the world 's second-largest handset manufacturer to build a cell phone , '' he said . `` It 's like you 're trying to get to your house , from here to there , so you buy an airline . '' He said that Nokia 's problems are concentrated outside their core Lumia line of Windows Phone smartphones , which have actually been selling fairly well in the U.S . Facebook 's recent IPO has disappointed many investors , even prompting some to sue the social networking company over allegations of preferential treatment . An official FacePhone might be just what the company needs to stimulate revenue . Purchasing or even partnering with Nokia ( which Entner said is much more likely ) `` would certainly spur a better integration with Windows Phone , '' he said . `` The problem is that Window Phone 's market share is still very modest . So it does n't really make that much of an impact . '' Entner said that although Facebook is the most popular smartphone app , he doubts there would be much consumer interest in an official Facebook phone . `` I think for some Facebook aficionados , sure , '' he said . `` For the mass appeal ? I do n't think so . '' `` I do n't think there 's anything to that rumor , '' he added . `` I 'm happily on the record saying that this is a half-assed idea from some imbecile . '' Other rumors have pointed toward HTC taking a stab at the Facebook phone ( and calling it `` Buffy '' ) , and further back , Motorola was also said to be working on a FacePhone . More recently , Facebook was rumored this week to be hiring former Apple hardware engineers to design a phone internally . Entner thinks this is the most likely of the Facebook phone theories . `` I think we all know that Facebook has an internal program to develop its own mobile device , '' he said . Whether the public will ever see that device - and what their reaction will be when they do - is uncertain .

It 's all go over at Facebook HQ with IPO strife , Instagram buyouts , rumours of smartphone creation and now reports that the company wants to buy its own web browser . Pocket-Lint says that the social network has its eye on the Opera browser , which has carved out a niche on Apple and Android mobile devices , but is also available on Mac and PC computers . Facebook is cash rich , following its stock exchange offering , and acquiring a browser would allow it to push its own functionality through plug-ins and toolbars . It would also enable the company to compete with the likes of Apple 's Safari and Google Chrome rather than rely on those browsers to push traffic to the Facebook.com desktop and mobile sites . The report 's `` trusted source '' did n't offer further information on the sums of money involved or the timescale for a possible bid . The Next Web followed up the report and says Opera Software , which owns the browser , is currently taking to potential buyers .
Speculation that Facebook plans to have another crack at building a smartphone has gathered pace in recent weeks and now The New York Times is in on the act . The 'paper says that Facebook has already hired half a dozen hardware and software engineers who had previously worked for Apple on the iPhone and one who worked on the iPad . The report brings word from several Facebook employees and outside engineers , sounded out about possible positions , that the company plans to release the phone `` by next year . '' The renewed efforts come following the social network 's rumoured plans to team up with HTC on a handset and earlier plans that were abandoned in 2010 . CEO Mark Zuckerberg has , according to the NYT , taken a particular interest and has been interviewing potential suitors for the project , codenamed `` Buffy . '' The 'paper says that Zuckerberg spoke to one engineer and `` peppered him with questions about the inner workings of smartphones . It did not sound like idle intellectual curiosity , the engineer said ; Mr. Zuckerberg asked about intricate details , including the types of chips used , he said . `` Another former Apple hardware engineer was recruited by a Facebook executive and was told about the company 's hardware explorations . '' One Facebook employee told the New York Times , says Zuckerberg is worried that the social network is just an app on other manufacturers ' hardware . Of course , having just ( somewhat disastrously ) floated on the stock exchange , Facebook is now in a position where it must establish new and increasing revenue streams , so a smartphone may form part of those plans . Facebook has not commented on the story and the reports says that the company is determined to keep it secret .

Facebook has launched its own photo creation and sharing app , just weeks after purchasing Instagram . One of the features of the app is to display photos from your Facebook friends list , giving you the option to enlarge individual photos or see more from a given album . For the first time , there is the option to upload several shots at the same time . The ability to edit photos is also included , an interesting move considering Facebook 's acquisition of Instagram for $ 1billion just a few weeks ago . Since then , the purchase has stalled as the American Federal Trade Commission looks into whether the partnership is anti-competitive or not . With 15 filters which can be applied to photos , in an interface which is very similar to Instagram , it seems clear that Facebook is chasing the same market as its new tool . Perhaps when ( or if ) the Instagram deal gets the green light , all of Instagram 's functionality will be integrated into the Facebook app . The launch comes in the same week that Facebook made its stock market debut , and just a few weeks after Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook 's founder , admitted that the company needed to think of new ways to garner profit from mobile users . The Facebook Camera app is available as a free download from the App store . At the moment , it 's only available for iOS devices - it 's not known whether plans are afoot for versions for other operating systems .

Facebook has recently been given a major overhaul with how information is presented with the new Timeline feature . How can businesses make the most of their Facebook Pages ? The extraordinary growth of Facebook – 900 million users and heading for a billion - means Facebook is now a commercial channel that no business can ignore . Today businesses use their Facebook pages to not only engage with their customers , but also to sell goods and services . Indeed , according to analysts IDC , 15 percent of the total customer spending in developed countries could be via Facebook within three to five years . The big name brands may grab all the limelight , but even the smallest enterprise can use Facebook to shout about its service and products and make real - and lasting connections - with their paying customers . In essence when viewed from a business perspective , Facebook can offer any business : Facebook had a facelift recently introducing a range of new features most notably the Timeline . Your business now has a large image space ( 851 x 315 ) pixels in size for the larger image , and 180 x 180 for the smaller image to brand your Facebook Pages . Note that your cover page photos ca n't include any contact information , calls to action messages or pricing information for your enterprises goods or services . However , this does n't mean you ca n't be creative as these businesses have been when designing their Timelines StarBucks Lexus Nike Dove Your business can also make the most of some new features that include : Facebook has now become much more interactive . Your business ' Pages should be interesting places to visit with new content regularly featured . Images have been shown to improve interactions so try and think visually when developing new content for your business ' Facebook Page . New content can now be 'pinned ' to the top of your Timeline giving your business a great opportunity to showcase its latest products , services or just tell your followers the latest news about your business . And do n't forget to ensure there is a call to action at the end of every piece of material you post . Remember , Facebook is about interaction and not just the passive consumption of content . The SYZYGY Group stated in their F-commerce report : `` There are no cookie cutter recipes for setting up successful Facebook stores for your brand fans ; F-commerce is too new and experimental for that . The best that brands can do is adopt a strategic approach to F-commerce , adopting something similar to the LEAD approach proposed by the Sloan Center for Internet Retailing . '' The LEAD approach is designed to de-risk innovation in social media : Selling products and services via your business ' Facebook page is now easier than it has ever been . Vendors that offer e-commerce apps that can be easily integrated into your enterprises Facebook page including : Even with F-commerce gaining momentum with each passing day , remember that your business ' Facebook Pages are first and foremost a way to interact and engage with your customers . Turning your Facebook Page into yet another online store is not advisable , as consumers understand the difference between e-commerce pages and their favourite social networks . Yes , they are open to some commercial messages , but tread carefully .

Facebook 's shareholders are suing the social networking giant , along with key underwriters for the company 's recent IPO , over allegedly misleading investors about the company 's growth forecasts . The lawsuit addresses the fact that just before Facebook went public , the principal underwriters reduced their estimates for the company 's second quarter growth without telling some investors about new key information . The lack of that information , the suit claims , inflated Facebook 's IPO price and caused losses from investors not `` preferred '' by Facebook . The lawsuit specifically targets Facebook and their principal underwriter Morgan Stanley , as well as underwriters Barclays Capital , Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase , and Merrill Lynch . Last Friday was Facebook 's first day of public trading , and by the end of the second day the price dropped more than 10 percent from the initial offering of $ 38 . By this morning , Facebook 's stock plunged to around $ 31 . Facebook 's underwriters reportedly cut their initial estimates because an executive at the social network shared important information with them regarding Facebook 's second-quarter growth . That key information was then conveyed verbally to a select group of potential investors - but other investors were left in the dark . Thus the seemingly inflated price of Facebook 's IPO , which , at $ 38 , appears particularly high now that the stock is hovering just over $ 30 . `` The main underwriters in the middle of the road show reduced their estimates and did n't tell everyone , '' Samuel Rudman , a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd , which brought the lawsuit , said in a published report . `` I do n't think any investor in Facebook would n't have wanted to know that information . '' Official communications channels have reportedly gone silent , and TechRadar has not fared any better in receiving comment . But a Facebook spokesperson has been quoted as saying `` We believe the lawsuit is without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously . ''

Another day , another Facebook page design . With the paint still drying on Timeline , Facebook is trying out another new look . It 's not as drastic a makeover as the Timeline change was , simply cleaning the header up a bit and moving some details up on to the cover image . As well as that , the boxed tabs under the cover image ( Friends , Photos , Map etc ) are now squished up into smaller graphics without pulling in images from your profile to populate them . The new new look is currently in beta testing - Facebook did n't mention to TPM which first spotted the change how many user profiles would be seeing the test profile . We can practically feel you all gearing up for a good old moan about the new look but cool your jets : there 's no guarantee that the social network will roll the tweaked profile out across the site though , so cool your jets . Beta testing is likely to throw up a bunch of problems – not least , what happens if your cover photo is white ? Or what if you 've painted a Pollock-esque masterpiece especially for your Facebook profile - how will you read the white text on that ?
Google CEO Larry Page says that the company is 'still waiting ' for Facebook to open up its users ' data for use in other applications . Speaking on The Charlie Rose Show over in the US , Google 's CEO described the data situation between the two companies , which is strained at best : `` I think it 's been unfortunate that Facebook has been pretty closed with their data , '' he began . In a moment of rare hyperbole , Page warns , `` You do n't want to be holding your users hostage . `` From a user 's perspective , you say I 'm joining Facebook . I want my contacts . In Google , we said , fine . You can get them from Google . `` And the issue we had is that then Facebook said , no , Google , you ca n't do the reverse . And so we just said , well , users do n't understand what they 're doing . They 're putting data in , and they do n't understand they ca n't take it out . `` So we said , well , we 'll only participate with people who have reciprocity . And we 're still waiting . '' Good luck with that . Since launching Google+ which is , essentially , GoogleBook , we ca n't see Zuck and friends falling over themselves to cooperate with the search company . And here 's a bonus comment for fans of stating the freaking obvious : Page admitted that he is `` really excited '' about Chrome being the world 's most-used web browser ( for now ) .

Facebook 's second day of public trading has seen the social networking giant 's shares continue to plummet . Facebook went public last Friday , and though the stock opened strong around $ 42 ( £26 ) ( $ 4 ( £5 ) over the initial price of $ 38 ( £24 ) ) , it ended on a weak note ( $ 38.23 , only 23 cents over the IPO ) by the time the bell sounded on Wall Street . Today marks day two of Facebook 's trades , and the price has continued to fall . By early afternoon it had fallen to $ 33.81 ( £21 ) , more than 11 percent below the IPO . At the closing bell , Facebook 's stock was sitting at $ 34.03 , 10.99 percent below the initial asking price . Facebook 's plunging stock should n't necessarily come as a surprise , as the company is still settling into the market and its worth is guaranteed to fluctuate . Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told TechRadar last Friday that the initial rise and fall of Facebook 's stock `` does n't have anything to do with what the company 's worth . '' `` It 'll find an equilibrium price in the next week or two , '' he said . `` I have a buy rating and a $ 44 ( £27 ) target , and I 'm standing by it . '' The Nasdaq admitted Sunday that there were some technically hiccups on Facebook 's opening day of trades . Large and small investors reported errors preventing their trades from going through , claiming those errors led to financial losses . The Nasdaq is recreating those trades to determine who will require compensation .

Facebook finished out its first day of public trading down by $ 4 ( £2.50 ) from a strong opening around $ 42 ( £26 ) to around $ 38 ( £24 ) by the sound of the bell . The cost plummeted to $ 38 just before noon before making a steady rise in the afternoon and eventually falling back down back to $ 38 , the same price as the social media giant 's initial IPO . `` [ Today 's trading ] does n't have anything to do with what the company 's worth , '' said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter . Facebook 's first day of public trading may have ended on a slightly sour note , but the company did manage to break at least one record : Facebook 's trading volume today was the biggest for any IPO in history . More than 460 million Facebook shares were traded today , narrowly surpassing the previous record of 458 million , reached by GM in 2010 . Facebook amended its IPO documents earlier this month due to the fact that the company does n't make ad revenue from mobile visitors , an increasingly significant portion of the site 's users . The question of Facebook 's long-term viability has also arisen , but at least one analyst thinks those worries are unfounded . `` It 'll find an equilibrium price in the next week or two , but [ today 's trading ] does n't have anything to do with what the company 's worth , '' Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told TechRadar . `` I think that the breakdown here was that they offered too many shares , '' Pachter said . `` And actually they sent a false signal to the Street on Wednesday when they decided to offer 50 million more shares , so the implication was that there was so much demand that we actually need more stock to satisfy it . And that turned out not to be right . '' `` That 's only an extra $ 2 billion [ £1.2 billion ] , '' he added . `` I mean , that 's just too much - $ 16 billion [ £10 billion ] was more than the market had an appetite for today . '' Pachter is confident that Facebook remains a sound long-term investment . `` I have a buy rating and a $ 44 [ £27 ] target , and I 'm standing by it , '' he said . `` That 's a 12-month target , and that 's really what I think it 's worth . '' Via The Wall Street Journal
With Facebook now officially trading publicly on the NASDAQ exchange , it is only fitting that social media is being leveraged to try and predict the IPO 's closing price . That is the experiment currently taking place at facebookipodayclosingprice.com . Inspired by a tweet from tech venture investor Chris Sacca and then cobbled together by programmer James Proud , the site set out to crowd source pundit estimates on Twitter to predict the Facebook IPO 's closing price . So how has the prediction experiment fared ? The Facebook IPO launched at $ 38 per share , valuing the company at a $ 104 billion . More than 2,200 predictions in the site projected high hopes for Facebook and estimated the closing share price to reach $ 54 for the day . That would bring the company 's value up to a staggering figure - a little more than $ 135.7 billion . The pundits may have been over-ambitious with their expectations . While the market is still open for several hours , Facebook 's share price has been hovering around $ 41 for most of the afternoon and has yet to break the $ 45 per share barrier . Of course , that is still a ludicrously high figure , raising over $ 16 billion for Mark Zuckerberg 's company .

Facebook will officially begin trading at $ 38 ( £24 ) per share on Friday morning in what will be the biggest IPO ever from an internet company . After months of speculation , and a week of last minute adjustments from Facebook , Friday 's listing on the NASDAQ index will raise $ 16 billion ( £10bn ) for Mark Zuckerberg 's company . The CEO himself , who founded the company in his Harvard dorm , is expected to become an instant billionaire , selling over 30m shares to net over $ 1.1bn ( £700m ) . The $ 38 shares , which will be available to buy to the public , will see the company valued at a staggering $ 104 billion ( £66bn ) overall , with $ 81 ( £51bn ) market capitalisation . The $ 16 billion-valued IPO dwarfs the previous mark achieved by an internet company . Google hit the stock market in 2004 in the years following the dotcom bust , and raised $ 1.67bn ( £1.05bn ) Facebook 's offering , however , is in a completely different stratosphere .
Facebook is testing a new Pages management app for the iPhone and iPad . The app , called Pages Manager , is available in New Zealand but could roll out more widely soon . The official description of the app is ; `` A new app from Facebook to help you keep up with your Page and connect with your audience in one place . '' Based on screenshots the app appears similar to Facebook 's existing iOS app , but it adds some new features , like access to Facebook 's Insights for tracking analytics data , such as the number of people sharing your page and the total number of people who have been exposed to your brand through the page . Currently Facebook Page owners can use the conventional mobile solutions - m.facebook.com website and the main Facebook iOS and Android apps – to access their Pages and write on their Timelines , but there is no ideal way to get notifications or analytics without a third-party service . The app is out in New Zealand , and should be out in the US soon , but as yet there are no dates for a UK launch , or whether an Android version will be available . Via : 9to5Mac
Yahoo 's claim that Facebook filed some of its patents fraudulently has come back to bite it as Facebook 's lawyers not only prove that the patent is legit , but also that no one has ever thought to actually check the available records until now . It 's embarrassment all round , as Yahoo alleged that a sworn declaration that should have existed did n't exist . But it does exist . As patent dispute expert Florian Mueller succinctly puts it , `` Yahoo 's lawyers alleged deception when they simply failed to do their job . Facebook obtained the record and provided it to the court , and in the process found out that nobody had even accessed ( ! ) the record before . '' You may recall that Yahoo reckons it actually came up with the basic idea behind Facebook and patented it back when a face book was just a book full of portraits and not the multi-billion dollar social network we know and sometimes love today . The patents in question today relate to systems for 'controlled distribution of user profiles over a network ' . It was actually a guy named Chris Chea who invented the system – or at least filed the patent for it – and Yahoo says his patent is invalid because a second inventor , Joseph Liauw , was named in a first document but left out of a second . Apparently Liauw was named in error , which Yahoo latched on to and said the only way he should have been dropped from that second document is with a signed affidavit saying he was erroneously included in the first place , otherwise the patent is invalid . Unfortunately for some researcher at Yahoo 's law firm , the affidavit was procured and included back in 2001 – a fact that did n't come to light until after Yahoo said that Facebook had been `` false and deceptive because no Oath or Declaration by Mr Liauw was ever submitted . '' And why did n't it come to light ? Because no one at Yahoo ever thought to look ; Facebook 's lawyers note that no other request for access to the relevant file had been made when they went looking for the affidavit themselves . So , basically , it 's a storm in a teacup because Yahoo did n't do its research properly . What an embarrassing development in a patent dispute that many already saw as embarrassing for Yahoo in the first place .

Facebook 's mobile app is getting a minor but noticeable upgrade - images in mobile users ' news feeds will appear larger starting this week . The update will hit the mobile website first and then roll out to the official iOS and Android Facebook apps afterward . Right now , the upgrade is currently announced for mobile Facebook users only . However , Facebook releases updates for its site frequently , so it wo n't be a surprise if larger images show up on the full-sized desktop version soon . Facebook goes public today , and CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors last week in a pre-IPO talk that the mobile world is Facebook 's top priority . Facebook wants to raise about $ 10.6 billion in its first public push , and to help drum up support Zuckerberg has been making public appearances and speaking with investors . He said last week that the company is `` just getting started '' with its mobile business , so it seems that larger images are n't going to be the only update in the coming months . The update to the Facebook 's mobile app appears to mimic a recent update made to the iOS app for Google 's own social network , Google+ . The update was released on May 9 , and it brought a number of changes to Google 's social app , including larger images as well as a more easy-to-use interface . A Google spokesperson told TechRadar that the Android version of the update was `` just around the corner , '' saying , `` Our overall goal is to create a consistent , beautiful and simple experience for all mobile Google+ users . '' Facebook and Google 's push for larger images in their mobile apps could be indicative of the direction the social and tech giants feel the mobile industry is headed : toward screens larger than the smartphones that fit in your pocket . Tablets and hybrid tablet/laptop devices with could indeed be the future , and rumors today even suggest that at least a dozen Windows 8 tablets could hit shelves by November .

Facebook has confirmed it is testing a new feature , which would allow users to pay a set fee to make their posts more visible . The Silicon Valley giant says it is attempting to gauge potential user interest in the scheme , after a Facebooker in New Zealand discovered the test . The promoted posts tool would allow users to pay anything from 25p ( $ 0.40 ) to £1.25 ( $ 2 ) to make their message carry further . `` We 're constantly testing new features across the site , '' a Facebook spokesperson told the BBC . `` This particular test is simply to gauge people 's interest in this method of sharing with their friends . '' We could imagine this would be useful in an emergency situation ( `` Our dog is missing '' ... etc ) or if you wanted to make friends more aware of a party or an event . However , more often than not , it 's likely to be used by those who 'll pay to make their social networking voice a little louder . Oh Joy . If the testing results in a fully fledged feature , it 'll represent Facebook 's first attempt to directly earn money from its 900m-strong user base .

What does $ 1 billion get you aside from a bunch of washed-out hipster looking photos ? A right pain in the neck , by the sounds of things , as Facebook 's plan to buy Instagram is delayed by investigation . The American Federal Trade Commission is apparently looking into the deal because there 's a chance that it could be anti-competitive . Although the investigation has n't been confirmed by anyone officially , the Financial Times broke the news by way of two sources 'familiar with the matter ' . A competition investigation is pretty standard practice for a deal worth this much money . The FTC 's investigation is said to include seeking information from major Facebook rivals Twitter and Google . Twitter was said to be eyeing an Instagram purchase before Facebook snapped the photo-app up , but we 're sure that wo n't colour its judgement… It 's likely that the deal will still be approved after the close scrutiny , but experts think it will probably hold the close of the deal up until after Facebook 's self-imposed deadline of end of June . It 's one thing after another for Facebook which is currently aiming for a smooth-sailing IPO session ; yesterday it conceded that it 's in danger of losing advertising revenues because its mobile apps are so successful .
Microsoft has announced that Bing is to go through its biggest redesign yet , with the search engine getting a tune-up . At an event in San Francisco a new-look Bing was shown off and it seems that Microsoft is to put more of a focus on social updates . It may be struggling to make a dent in the popularity of Google – it 's currently snapped up 16 per cent of the market , compared to Google 's 66.4 per cent – but the one thing Microsoft does have in its arsenal is the ability to seed social search into Bing . Google currently does this with Google+ , but Bing still has the indexing rights to both Twitter and Facebook – something that could well prove lucrative for the search minnow . Microsoft outed the main changes to Bing in a blog , with the service now taking on the mantra : 'spend less time searching and more time doing ' . The social feeds are set to come in the form of a sidebar , which Microsoft reckons is 'never intrusive ' as it is now in a dedicated place and not mixed in with the main feed . Bing will also allow you to ask friends a question within its search functionality – where 's Jeeves when you need him ? – and there 's also an activity bar so you can see posts and queries that friends have decided to share with Bing . `` People have become as important as pages and search needs to evolve to embrace these changes , '' said The Bing Team in its blog . `` The challenge has been to figure out how to integrate the information you care about with the people who can be most helpful to you in getting stuff done . '' The rollout is set to come to the US by the end of the month and the UK should see the redesign soon after . Google has also been testing some changes to its search algorithm , with some semantic searches popping up for users .

Facebook has had to amend its IPO documents to concede that the shift to people accessing the social network from mobile devices could hurt its ad revenues . When you go on Facebook through an app on a phone or a tablet , you do n't see any advertising in your newsfeed like you do on the web edition ( although sponsored stories do pop up ) . So this means that although Facebook is clocking up more and more daily active users , the number of ads the site shows is rising more slowly , leading to a lower average revenue per user than the network is used to . As Facebook puts it in the amended document , `` We do not currently directly generate any meaningful revenue from the use of Facebook mobile products , and our ability to do so successfully is unproven . `` We believe this increased usage of Facebook on mobile devices has contributed to the recent trend of our daily active users ( DAUs ) increasing more rapidly than the increase in the number of ads delivered . '' While that 's not the kind of thing potential investors really want to hear , Facebook will get props for being up front about the challenge and putting its braintrust to work on how to get around it .
As well as announcing the ability to build and sell paid apps on Facebook with the App Center , the social media business also announced another feature to help developers get more from the platform . Facebook announced on the Facebook Developer blog it will provide developers with an `` app ratings metric '' for them to understand how users rate their app over time . The App ratings , will be available from the Insights pages on Facebook and will be on a scale of one to five stars , and will be broken down by age and gender . This will give developers new insight into the feedback their apps receive . Previously , developers could only see their apps ' average overall rating and they could not see how the rating varied over time . The ratings will also decide where an app appears in the App Center as the Facebook developer blog warns , `` Well-designed apps that people enjoy will be prominently displayed . Apps that receive poor user ratings or do n't meet the quality guidelines wo n't be listed . '' The App Center is expected to go live in the coming weeks and Facebook recommends `` developers should start preparing today to make sure their app is included for the launch . ''
Facebook has announced it will launch a new tool to allow users to discover the best apps , games and services that connect with the social network . An app store of sorts , the new App Center will become a key feature of the Facebook.com website as well as the apps for iOS and Android when it launches in the coming weeks . App Center will rank the likes of Spotify , Pinterest and Draw Something through user ratings , average time spent using the app , and how often it is voluntarily shared by users . Each user will see a list of top apps , designed for them based on their own usage patterns , so personal leaderboards will not be dominated by the the same old apps that simply boast the most users . In a post on the Facebook developers ' blog Aaron Brady says : `` For the over 900 million people that use Facebook , the App Center will become the new , central place to find great apps like Draw Something , Pinterest , Spotify , Battle Pirates , Viddy , and Bubble Witch Saga . `` Everything has an app detail page , which helps people see what makes an app unique and lets them install it before going to an app . `` Success through the App Center is tied to the quality of an app . We use a variety of signals , such as user ratings and engagement , to determine if an app is listed in the App Center . '' The company will also let developers charge a one-off fee to use their service through Facebook and is encouraging developers to create their 'App detail page ' today . The move comes months after the launch of Facebook 's Open Graph initiative . This has allowed many top content providers to integrate their services into Facebook , with activity appearing in the user 's Timeline or within the Live Ticker . A fully-customised app discovery hub , which directs users to the best services with Facebook integration seems to be the next logical step . Via : TechCrunch

While Facebook frequently takes heat over privacy issues and continual changes to the look and feel of its website , the social network wants you to know it can also do some good as well - including encouraging users to become organ donors . Facebook introduced a subtle new feature to your profile on Tuesday . But if you blink , you might miss it . Tucked away among life events in the Health & Wellness section of your Timeline is a new option to become an organ donor , and share your decision with other Facebook friends . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg calls the new Timeline feature part of `` a life-saving initiative '' to create `` broader awareness about organ donation . '' `` By simply telling people that you 're an organ donor , the power of sharing and connection can play an important role , '' Zuckerberg explained , noting that 18 Americans die each day waiting for organ transplants that never come . If you 're not sure how to get started as a donor , the Facebook link allows users to register to become an organ , eye or tissue donor , then share this proud accomplishment with the rest of your social network . The feature is currently only available for Facebook users in the U.S. , who may `` Like '' this latest addition to one of their favorite social networking sites .

The Facebook app for iPhone , iPad and iPod touch would probably finish top of the most-used , least-loved chart , but that could be about to change . The New York Times ' tech blog has word that a new official app , built from the ground up , will arrive next month to eliminate the current `` painfully slow '' user experience . The reason for the present application 's sluggish performance , according to the anonymous developers who spoke to the NYT , is the hybrid programming language . The present iteration is built with HTML5 components within an Objective-C ( the primary programming language used for iOS apps ) shell . That is like `` putting the engine of a Smart Car in the body of a Ferrari , '' points out the NYT 's Nick Bilton , who has seen the new app in action . The forthcoming update has been built completely using Objective-C , which will make better use of the zippy hardware in iOS devices and bring a `` blazing fast '' new app . Facebook has declined to comment on the speculation , but it seems that we 'll be getting a new app sooner rather than later , with one goal in mind : Speed . Via : NYT

Facebook recently rolled out a feature called `` Find Friends Nearby , '' which allowed users on mobile devices to find other users in their immediate vicinity , before immediately un-rolling it . The feature was available for a brief time to mobile Facebook users through iOS and Android apps and Facebook 's mobile website before being removed . TechRadar reached out to Facebook for comment , though reports indicate that the feature was made available simply as a test , and that Find Friends Nearby wo n't necessarily be made official any time soon . `` This was n't a formal release , '' a Facebook spokesperson said in a published report , `` this was just something that a few engineers were testing . With all tests , some get released as full products , others do n't . Nothing more to say on this for now , but we 'll communicate to everyone when there is something to say . '' Facebook 's Find Friends Nearby feature could manifest as an effort to expand Facebook 's mobile offerings in light of the social networking company 's recent disappointing debut on Wall Street . But its ability to locate nearby users regardless of whether they 're `` friends , '' despite similar functionality already existing in other location-based apps , raises some privacy concerns , said one expert . `` There 's a great term that I heard recently from James Grimmelmann , who 's a professor at New York Law School , called 'privacy lurches ' , '' Frank Pasquale , professor of law at Seton Hall Law School , told TechRadar . `` That sounds like a classic privacy lurch , '' he added . `` Consumers do n't expect anything like this , and they never expected it when [ Facebook ] started . The whole premise of the service was controlled information , '' he continued , adding that being able to `` share with some people and not share with others '' is important . `` That seems to upend the whole premise of the social network . '' Indeed , interactions on Facebook are typically limited between users who are n't friends , and it 's doubtful the Find Friends Nearby feature would be any different . In other words , `` they 'd have to just make sure that everybody involved in it opted in , '' Pasquale concluded , rather than having the feature on by default . Facebook 's Find Friends Nearby feature was reportedly born of a `` hackathon '' encouraged by the company itself , according to Facebook software engineer Ryan Patterson . He said in a comment that the feature is meant to help people who 've just met find one another by opening the Find Friends Nearby page from their mobile devices , as opposed to doing a search on one another 's names , which can be unreliable . It 's certainly convenient , but even with the ability to determine when Find Friends Nearby can detect you , surprise invasions of privacy are always a possibility when technology like this is made available . TechRadar asked Facebook to comment on these concerns , and this story will be updated if the company responds . Via Wired
Facebook has sneakily changed the default email address on your profile to your @ facebook.com one . So even if you had specifically set the email address you use all the time for everything to show up on your profile , it has been changed to your Facebook address that you probably never use for anything . It 's a move that has irritated a lot of people because Facebook did it without asking or notifying anyone . It 's all part of a cunning plan to make sure you never leave Facebook ever again . Facebook launched its branded email addresses as part of its Facebook Messages service way back in 2010 – users could have an @ facebook.com email address and , if anyone ever uses it , emails are delivered to their Facebook messages inbox . A spokesperson describes the move as one that `` gives people the choice to decide which addresses they want to show on their timeline '' , wilfully ignoring the fact that most people were already showing the address they wanted on their timeline and now have to mess about changing it back . To do so , go to your settings page , then edit 'Contact Info ' – here you can choose to hide any and all email addresses from your timeline .

Facebook has integrated a new feature into its mobile apps and website , which allows users to spot nearby pals , or easily make friends with people they 've just met . The Find Friends Nearby page uses GPS coordinates and shows other people currently visiting that 'meeting room , ' whether you 're already friends with them or not . Non-friends will be listed in an 'Others ' section . Of course there 's the immediate assumption that the tool could be used for people to stalk random revellers in bars , but anyone on the Find Friends Nearby page is looking to be found anyway . The feature has not been officially launched yet , but TechCrunch reports that it 's available to use for those seeking it out . After publishing the story , TechCrunch received comments from the Facebook developer who built the project , Ryan Patterson . He said : `` This particular product uses geolocation to find your GPS coordinates when you are on the page . Everyone who is visiting the page within a radius around your coordinates at the same time as you will be listed . Once you leave the page , you stop showing up on others ' lists . `` For me , the ideal use case for this product is the one where when you 're out with a group of people whom you 've recently met and want to stay in contact with . `` Facebook search might be effective , or sharing your vanity addresses or business cards , but this tool provides a really easy way to exchange contact information with multiple people with minimal friction . '' The functionality can be accessed through http : //fb.com/ffn on the mobile web , while also though the iOS and Android apps ( menu > apps > find friends > other tools > Find Friends Nearby . ) The innovation comes months after Facebook purchased the Glancee app , which is geared towards helping people find those with similar interests to their own . It 's unclear whether this tech has been involved in creating Find Friends Nearby .

Facebook is rolling out a new feature that allows users to make changes to their comments on the site . The option to edit will show up on any comment you post but it does n't look like you can actually change status updates , so you 'll still have to be careful with those . Not everyone will have the edit function just yet , as it 's rolling out to Facebook users over the next few days . Update : Facebook tells us that the comment editing history will be available so `` people can see the full context of the conversation '' ( see main image ) , thus preventing you from carrying out mischevious Operation Make Your Friends Look Like Idiots as outlined below . Spoilsports . On behalf of drunken , fat-fingered smartphone users everywhere , we would like to express our eternal gratitude for this new feature and only quietly question why we were n't just allowed to do this from the beginning . Now , go and abuse this new function to make your friends look like idiots , we 're fairly confident there 's a way . If only someone could convince Twitter to do the same thing , we could avoid embarrassing typos forever .

Facebook and Yahoo 's months-long patent battle could soon come to an end , as the two companies are currently engaged in peace talks aimed at reaching a settlement . Yahoo 's attorney Kevin Smith recently requested that the federal court grant the the companies more time to negotiate . `` The parties are currently engaged in settlement negotiations to resolve this dispute , '' Smith wrote . `` The parties believe that a further extension will facilitate settlement . '' Facebook and Yahoo 's patent battle began in March , when Yahoo brought a suit against the social media giant for allegedly infringing on 10 of Yahoo 's patents . `` Facebook 's entire social network model , which allows users to create profiles for and connect with , among other things , persons and businesses , is based on Yahoo 's patented social networking technology , '' Yahoo claimed . Yahoo even used the term `` free riding '' to describe Facebook 's success . In response , Facebook counter-sued in April , alleging that Yahoo is in fact violating 10 of their patents , several of which were apparently purchased rather recently . All the while , Facebook professed their innocence , as they continue to do . Neither party has come out looking particularly innocent , though . Yahoo blundered last month when an important document their lawyers claimed did n't exist turned out to very much exist . Facebook , on the other hand , has been accused of snatching up patents for the sole purpose of retaliating against Yahoo 's suit . Hopefully , this farce ends soon , or the internet could become as bogged down in legal battles as the smartphone and tablet industry currently is .

Facebook has dropped its Credits virtual currency in exchange for real money , which it says will make life easier for app developers and users . Announcing the news on its Developers ' blog , the social network said the time had come to end the need for ' a platform-wide virtual currency . ' The transition will allow users to pay for things like power-ups in Facebook-based games like Draw Something , CityVille and The Sims . As it currently stands , users can buy 50 Facebook Credits for $ 5 , 105 for $ 10 and so on . Those credits can then be spent on apps and games , at the user 's discretion . `` By supporting pricing in local currency , we hope to simplify the purchase experience , give you more flexibility , and make it easier to reach a global audience of Facebook users who want a way to pay for your apps and games in their local currency , '' wrote Facebook 's Prashant Fuloria . `` With local pricing , you will be able to set more granular and consistent prices for non-US users and price the same item differently on a market-by-market basis , '' he added . So now , instead of spending your credits on games , you 'll spend actual cash . In the same blog post , Facebook added that paid subscriptions for apps and games will be unleashed to the Facebook.com site and mobile apps next month . The initiative will allow developers and content providers to start charging monthly fees to give users access to exclusive content . Among the first to embrace the scheme will be game developers Zynga and KIXEYE .
Facebook has launched two new features to help app developers , subscriptions and local-currency pricing . The new features announced on the Facebook Developers blog make Facebook more competitive in the apps market and should attract new developers to the Facebook app market . The most exciting new addition for developers is probably the in-app subscriptions functionality . Facebook Product Management Director Prashant Fuloria describes the reasons behind the move to subscription purchases , `` Many developers successfully monetize their apps with one-time purchases of virtual items . Beginning in July , we are launching subscriptions as another way for you to build your businesses on Facebook . With subscriptions , you can establish a recurring revenue stream and offer updated content or premium experiences for a monthly fee . '' The subscriptions feature will be available to all Facebook.com and mobile web apps in July but they 're already on trial with developers such as KIXEYE and Zynga . The second new Facebook update is a move to local currency pricing . Previously all in-app payments were in app-specific virtual currencies or Facebook Credits . From now developers will be able to charge in the users local currencies including sterling , US Dollars and Japanese yen , instead of Credits . Fuloria commented `` By supporting pricing in local currency , we hope to simplify the purchase experience , give you more flexibility , and make it easier to reach a global audience of Facebook users who want a way to pay for your apps and games in their local currency . With local pricing , you will be able to set more granular and consistent prices for non-US users and price the same item differently on a market-by-market basis . '' During the move to local currency , Facebook will convert any customers ' Facebook Credit balances into the equivalent amount of value in users ' local currency , and will allow users to already purchased redeem gift cards and store unused balances in their account . The move to local currency will be mandatory for developers and any apps or games that sell virtual items will be required to use local currency by the end of the year . The new in-apps subscription service will launch with local currency conversion and local currency usage in-apps will be phased in over the rest of the year .

People who wished for creepier , more intrusive Facebook ads are in luck . The social media site will soon launch ads based on your everyday web browsing . The new ad initiative is dubbed Facebook Exchange , and will allow advertisers to bid on real-time ad space using your browser cookies . For example , if someone visits a travel site but does n't purchase their trip , the next time they visit Facebook there could be ads for discounted flights and hotels to their desired destination . Because advertisers will bid on the ads in real-time , it could allow for highly specific and time-sensitive ads , such as reminders for a show about to air on TV . Facebook Exchange will begin rolling out to users in the next few weeks . The real-time bidding will make use of cookies in your browser to specifically tailor ads to users . In the travel example , the travel site will leave a cookie in your browser containing an anonymous user ID . Then , it would send that ID along to Facebook . The next time you log into Facebook advertisers will be notified based on your cookie IDs , allowing them to bid on your Facebook ad space in real-time . Now that the Facebook 's stock has gone public , the social media giant is investigating new ad models to please investors . Facebook Exchange is one such venture , though advertisers will still be able to purchase ad space based on profile demographics . Facebook says that it will not share any user data with advertisers as part of Facebook Exchange , and all users will have the choice to opt out in their account settings .

Facebook has added another photo-based application to its arsenal , with the purchase of popular facial recognition service Face.com . The website , most famous for its free KILK iOS app , already links-up with Facebook by picking out the mugs of your pals and suggesting tags before uploading snaps to the social network . That functionality is now likely to be integrated into Facebook 's own mobile apps , including the recently-released Camera add-on for iOS , although that 's just an assumption at this stage . KLIK also features a host of Instagram-like filters that can be applied before uploads take place and also has an API that 's been used by a host of third-party app developers . Following months of courting each other 's affections , it 's thought that the social network has splashed out up to $ 100m ( £60m ) for Face.com . That 's a fraction of the $ 1 billion in cash and shares the company doled out to take ownership of Instagram earlier this year , but still remains a considerable chunk of change . In a post on the Face.com blog CEO Gil Hersh says : `` We love building products , and like our friends at Facebook , we think that mobile is a critical part of people 's lives as they both create and consume content , and share contentwith their social graph . `` By working with Facebook directly , and joining their team , we 'll have more opportunities to build amazing products that will be employed by consumers – that 's all we 've ever wanted to do . '' The acquisition , which Facebook is yet to comment on , will massively boost its mission to become the number one - both numerically and functionally - photo sharing destination on the web .
There 's a little sporting get together going on in London this summer and you 're all invited - on Facebook at least . The social network has announced a new Olympics hub that brings official Pages for athletes , teams , sports , mascots and so on together into one place . From the hub page , you can explore and 'like ' all the participating athletes on Facebook ( currently about 100 , but more to be added ahead of the opening ceremony in late July ) , or check out news and updates about the specific teams or events you 're into . We , for example , are particularly interested in the Taekwondo - so Facebook suggests we 'like ' the brilliantly-abbreviated World Taekwondo Federation ( WTF ) . Naturally , news from these corners of the Games will filter into your news feed if you make the bold move of liking the pages ( we managed to resist the lure of the WTF ) . It 's not quite the ultimate live-stream test that the BBC is implementing , but the hub should help athletics fans from further afield feel more involved in the Games . If you 're that way inclined , you can join the sporting hysteria and check out the portal on Facebook by visiting facebook.com/pages/olympics

Facebook CTO Bret Taylor has announced he will be leaving the social network this summer to start his own company . Taylor , who has pioneered the recent introduction of Timeline profiles , Open Graph apps , iOS 6 integration and the iOS camera app , says the time is right to leave following the recent IPO . The new company , details of which remain unknown , will be founded with Taylor 's pal Kevin Gibbs , who is currently heading-up the Google App Engine programme . He says : `` I 've learned more than I ever imagined in my time at Facebook . I 'm also extremely grateful for my relationship with all of the amazing people I 've worked with here . '' Taylor has been with the company since 2009 when Facebook bought out his FriendFeed network . He says embarking on another start-up has always been in his sights . `` I had always been upfront with Mark that I eventually wanted to do another start-up , '' he said in an interview with All Things D . `` And we felt now is the best time after the IPO and the launch of some recent things for me to do that . '' Taylor 's role will now be split into two , with existing employees stepping-up to the plate . Mike Vernal will look after platform development and Cory Ondreijka will oversee Facebook 's mobile offerings .

Facebook 's kicking its video chatting game up a notch , making it easier than ever to dial up a friend via the service 's built-in chat tools . And who 's to blame for the quick tweaks ? Likely Airtime – the launch of the `` New Chatroulette , '' as some have pegged the service , seems to have lit a fire under Facebook 's feet to get its own video chat services better established among its user base . Here 's what 's new : Facebook 's added a brand-new `` Call '' button to everyone 's Timelines . Click on `` Call '' and up pops your video chat – it 's that simple . Sort-of . The caveat with the new button is that it only appears if your friends are actually logged in to Facebook chat when you click on over to their Timeline profiles . If so , you 'll see the button appear between the standard `` Message '' button and gear icon , representing one 's Settings drop-down menu . It 's a far more elegant solution than the old method of video chatting with one 's friends , whereby a Facebook user had to first open up a chat window with a friend by clicking on their name within Facebook 's right-hand sidebar . From there , you 'd have to click on the tiny video camera icon to fire up Facebook 's video chat . Yuck . Facebook still has n't unveiled a host of features that it brought up back when Facebook video chat was first officially unveiled in July of 2011 , according to a TechCrunch report . Still missing from the picture is any way to have video within a group chat with one 's friends ( a la Google+ Hangouts ) , as well as Facebook-to-Skype video calling or some kind of mechanism for making outbound calls to real-life phone numbers via Facebook . It 's fair to say that Facebook 's chat features are a bit lacking compared to its peers . While the service 's Skype integration was seen as an interesting start to a new future in social network-driven conversations last year , it does n't appear as if Facebook has really done much to expand its chat services to better compete against the different competitors now eyeing the space . If social video chatting is your thing , Google+ Hangouts offer a fairly compelling experience . If you want to chat with strangers – but still stay connected to Facebook , so you can more easily reduce the number of naked people in your experience – you go to Airtime . Aside from simple text-based conversations , and completely owning the social space , what does Facebook chat bring to the table ? At least , now , Facebook 's changes will help users better tap into video chats if they so choose – or remember that Facebook video chats even exist . Via TechCrunch

Rumours of the existence of a Samsung-made Facebook competitor have been greatly exaggerated . So says Samsung in a statement on its website , where it says the rumours is 'groundless ' . Likely keen to distance itself from the rumoured project 's terrible codename 'Samsung Facebook ' , the statement points out that there 's just no need for it . `` 'Family Story ' has been available since February 2012 on Samsung Smart TVs , smartphones , tablets and the web , '' reads the missive . `` This service , like its name , is a family-oriented convergence service that focuses on sharing and storing families ' special moments . `` It is true that we currently are working on upgrading 'Family Story ' as we always thrive to provide consumers with enhanced experiences , but this is far from a 'Samsung Faceboook ' as some are claiming it to be . '' From Samsung

Word on the information superhighway is that Samsung is looking to create its own Facebook-style social network . Imaginatively code-named Samsung Facebook , it 's meant to be accessible on smart TVs and cameras as well as on the traditional smartphones and tablets . The early bones of the social network are supposedly set for an early 2013 release , inspired by the relative success of ChatOn . The key to ChatOn 's success has been instant messaging between different types of device on different platforms – as well as being on Samsung 's bada OS , its an app on iOS , Android , BlackBerry and Windows Phone as well as on PCs . According to Korea Times ' sources , the network will integrate with Amazon 's cloud services , as well as being built into Family Story , Samsung 's existing social app . One official told the paper , `` By the end of the year , we will have a polished and finished version of Family Story that will be offered first to Samsung device users for free . `` The new service will become available in the first quarter of next year at the earliest . `` The eventual goal is to expand our social media service across different devices from different companies across different mobile platforms . That includes cameras , televisions and blue-ray players . `` We are confident that the service will be popular globally . That means we need to guard against the possibilities of a data bottleneck . That 's why we want a server-based computing structure and disperse with a network of servers across different countries . ''
Apple has decided to pull the plug on its iTunes Ping social networking experiment , according to reports . The company annoyed the bejesus out of Facebook when it launched the service in September of 2010 , beginning a period of frosty relations between the tech giants . However , Ping , which encourages users to follow their favourite artists and keep track of what their pals are listening to and buying on iTunes , has failed to lure the massive customer base . Now Apple is finally embracing Facebook with full integration in iOS 6 , to sit alongside the baked-in Twitter functionality , it seems the company is happy to let the big two do the talking for them . AllThingsD reckons Ping , which currently exists within iTunes 10.6.3 and is a non-functioning feature within the iOS 6 Beta , will be gone when iTunes 11 and iOS 6 launch in full later this year . During a recent interview at the site 's D10 conference , Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted that Ping had failed to connect with the public . He said : `` We tried Ping , and I think the customer voted and said 'This is n't something that I want to put a lot of energy into . ' '' That sounds like a man who , in this particular instance , is ready to admit defeat does n't it ? Via : AllThingsD

Facebook is to release the identity of trolls who bullied a woman over the social network . A court has ordered the social network to give up the information after Nicola Brookes was harassed for months by anonymous internet types . Brookes ' heinous crime ? Supporting disgraced X-Factor brat Frankie Cocozza in a status update . This sparked a flow of abuse , with one person allegedly creating a fake profile in her name and using it to send X-rated messages to other Facebookers . The trolls also published Brookes ' home address and stalked her across the internet . Facebook has faced criticism before for not doing enough to stop bullying on the site , leading it to increase reporting controls across the social network . A spokesperson said , `` There is no place for harassment on Facebook , but unfortunately a small minority of malicious individuals exist online , just as they do offline . '' Facebook required the court order before it would hand over the perps ' details – Rupinder Bains , Brookes ' solicitor , explained , `` Basically we need to show it 's in the interests of justice ... we need to prove the third party , namely Facebook , is n't just a mere witness but is in fact involved in the wrongdoing , albeit innocently , but they are involved . `` We were able to meet that criteria and hence the order was granted . '' From BBC
Facebook has launched a new App Center to help users find exciting new Facebook apps and games to use on the social network . It comes with personalised app recommendations among its 600+ apps , as well as the ability to nose through and ruthlessly copy games and plug-ins your pals are using . You 'll be able to preview the apps from the App Center before you install them too – which includes an overview of the privacy settings and allowances each app needs . The App Center looks a lot like iTunes , if we 're honest , and is in a similar vein to Spotify 's App Finder - but unlike the music service , Facebook 's Mobile apps are also getting access to the App Center . At least , the iOS and Android apps are , allowing for apps to be sent from the desktop to your mobile device , as well as letting you browse the catalogue from your phone . US-based Facebook users will start seeing the App Center in their Facebook menus from today , while the rest of the world should get it over the coming weeks . It 's all part of Facebook 's grand plan to have you document the minutiae of your day-to-day life in your Facebook Timeline , including the song 's you listen to , books you read , movies you watch , food you cook , people you stal ... wait , no , we mean friends you 're closest to and basically every mundane thought that runs through your mind . We remain unconvinced .

With everything that 's been going on with Facebook , from their IPO , to the proposed expansion of their headquarters , the company needs to explore avenues in which it can make money . According to an article by the Wall Street Journal , Facebook is looking at the under 13 audience base . Currently , kids under the age of 13 are banned from creating an account on the social media site . This is a common practice on a lot of site , especially social media , as there are too many federal restrictions that are in place . The easy fix is to restrict anyone under the age limit from having access . However , this does not deter people from lying about their ages and creating an account . There are about 7.5 million under aged users on Facebook at present , according to Consumer Reports . According to CBS News , some parents are guilty of helping create these falsified profiles for their kids . Basically just adding to the problem . At present , Facebook is conducting experiments and testings to see what the best-suited solution would be , should they decide to go after this market . As of right now , there are no real safeguards in place for under aged users that have falsified accounts . Maybe a well-regulated and monitored version of the social media site that ties the account to the parents ' accounts would help where parental controls could be in place , would be a solution .

Facebook has agreed to hold a public vote on its proposed new privacy policy , following pressure from activists on the social networking site . The Facebook Site Governance Vote , as its being called , is now open for one week only and gives users the option of adopting the changes to its Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and its Data Use Policy . The Facebook vs Europe group wants huge changes to both , and is encouraging users to shoot down these slight revisions , saying it wants Facebook to do more . If enough people vote either way , the changes will come into effect or be scrapped . If not they 'll go under advisory . However , Facebook has made it as difficult and time consuming as possible for users to determine what it is that they 're actually voting for . Users will have to read the proposed and existing SRR and Data Use Policy to have any hope of understanding what the changes are . Both are substantial reads . With that in mind , it seems highly unlikely that people will vote in those numbers , so once again it 'll probably down to Facebook to tweak its policy . The protest , spearheaded by Max Schrems , an Austrian Facebook user , saw him mobilise fellow frequenters of the site to comment 7,000 times on Facebook 's Site Governance Page , triggering the public vote . He says : `` If the new policy does not go through , Facebook would have to rewrite the policy and might improve something . In addition the new policy grants Facebook even more rights to exploit our data and limit our privacy , which we can not support . '' Via : TechCrunch

Facebook users were surprised yesterday to find the site suffering from some rare downtime . Service failures on Facebook began early Thursday morning and continued throughout the day . Outages for the site were seen as late as 6am PST the following morning . `` Some users briefly experienced issues loading the site , '' Facebook said in a statement regarding the outage . `` The issues have since been resolved and everyone should now have access to Facebook . We apologize for any inconvenience . '' Facebook has not offered an explanation for what caused the typically smooth operating site to lose service . On the other hand , notorious hacker collective , Anonymous , appears to offer an explanation by taking credit for Facebook 's downtime . During the outage the YourAnonNews Twitter account yesterday posted the message , `` Looks like good old FaceBook is having packet problems… # F * * * FaceBook | # OpFaceBook | # F * * * YourIPO . '' It was followed an hour later by a second tweet , `` Oh yeah… RIP Facebook a new sound of tango down ... '' If the purpose of the attack was to damage Facebook 's newly launched IPO , then it worked . The Facebook IPO is currently $ 1.85 down , or 6.25 percent , from its closing price yesterday . However , despite the claims from Anonymous , there is still some doubt . A Facebook spokesperson said , `` I can confirm that yesterday 's issues were not the result of a denial-of-service attack . '' Direct denial of service ( DDoS ) attacks have historically been the Anonymous group 's primary tool against its targets . If the cause was n't from a DDoS attack then an internal issue may be to blame . Facebook still has n't issued a statement on what caused service outages yesterday .

Facebook has been tinkering away behind the scenes , adding a read-it-later feature to its mobile apps and an updated photo viewer to the desktop site . The reader feature has only rolled out to a lucky few iOS-using Facebookers and is clearly a part of the site 's strategy to become more newsy , joining 'trending stories ' in the news feed . `` Press and hold anywhere on a story to save it for later , '' the new feature instructs and once you 've done that , saved stories can be found in an exciting new folder called 'Saved ' in the main mobile menu . And do n't worry , saved stories are kept private so no one will know that you 're obsessively tracking the K-Stew/R-Patz break-up . Or , you know , proper news . No need to feel left out , desktop users - you 'll soon be benefitting from Facebook 's latest photo viewing tweaks . You 'll start seeing bigger photos laid out in a pleasing tiled design in the Photos tab of your profile , as well as having the quick and easy option to highlight your most flattering shots . The photo update is rolling out to all desktop Facebook users from today . From Facebook and iMore

Mark Zuckerberg has insisted that a Facebook phone `` would n't make sense '' for the company to do . With Facebook 's first financial results since their IPO just about holding up to expectations - but not doing enough to stop shares plummeting - Zuckerberg discussed the company 's future in an earnings call . When asked directly about rumours around the HTC Facebook phone , Zuckerberg stated that a smartphone `` really would n't make much sense for us to do . '' Instead , Zuckerberg wants Facebook to focus on improving its mobile apps and integration with all mobile devices . `` We want not just to have apps that people use , but be as deeply integrated as possible , where other apps can build on top of Facebook , '' Zuckerberg said . Embedded Facebook functionality has already been seen in handsets , but Zuckerberg is aware that being platform agnostic is a key factor in keeping his audience . But if the company 's value continues to drop , do n't rule out some more ambitious moves from the world 's biggest social network .

After stumbling with the launch of its IPO , Facebook returns with better than expected numbers for its second quarter earnings report . Facebook earned total revenue of $ 1.18 billion in its second quarter , an increase of 32 percent over last year 's $ 895 in revenue . Advertising makes up the bulk of Facebook 's earnings , representing $ 992 million of its total revenue , a 28 percent increase over last year . Payments and fees , such as those made by users , made up the rest of the company 's revenue accounting for $ 192 . Facebook 's largest success for the past quarter came from the expanded rollout of its Sponsored Stories feature . The feature enables advertisers to promote posts about their products , giving those posts prominent placement and wider circulation in user news feeds . By the end of June Sponsored Stories brought in revenue of $ 1 million each day , with half of that from mobile users . Mobile will be a large focus for Facebook going forward , as the social network saw a 67 percent increase in monthly active users on mobile devices to 543 million users . Facebook 's overall userbase continues to grow as well , with a 29 percent increase in monthly active users to 955 million , and a 32 percent increase in daily active users up to 552 million users . `` Our goal is to help every person stay connected and every product they use be a great social experience , '' Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said . `` That 's why we 're so focused on investing in our priorities of mobile , platform and social ads to help people have these experiences with their friends . '' It seems Facebook is not prepared to go fully mobile quite yet , or at least not on the record about it . When the rumored HTC Facebook phone was brought up during the Q & A portion of the earnings call , Mark Zuckerberg was quick to shoot it down saying that a smartphone `` really would n't make much sense for us to do . '' Instead , Zuckerberg wants Facebook to focus on improving its mobile apps and integration with all mobile devices . `` We want not just to have apps that people use , but be as deeply integrated as possible , where other apps can build on top of Facebook , '' Zuckerberg said . With the Facebook smartphone still a year away according to the most recent rumors , it may simply be too early to offer an official word on the device . But if deep smartphone integration is what Facebook is after , having their device is the natural next step . Not too long after Thursday afternoon 's earnings call , Facebook 's shares began to take a dive.It seems that investors were n't impressed with the social network 's 32 percent revenue increase after its first quarter as a public company , and stock prices fell to $ 24 - a 10 percent decline . This is an all time low for Facebook 's stock , further echoing the company 's struggles since its troubled IPO in May . The Valley and the market will be watching to see if Facebook 's stock drops any further by tomorrow 's opening bell .
An official Facebook Phone may be with us sometime next year , courtesy of Taiwanese manufacturer HTC . HTC has already launched a couple of handset which sport dedicated Facebook buttons , the HTC ChaCha and HTC Salsa , providing users with a quick way to jump into the social network 's app on their phone - although these handsets proved to be something of a flop with consumers , despite relative critical acclaim . According to Bloomberg West , HTC is about to take the next step and develop and full-on Facebook Phone – set to arrive in the middle of 2013 . Currently there are no further details on the proposed handset , but we 'd expect it to come running Android ( probably Jelly Bean ) , with HTC 's Sense overlay which may be heavily tweaked to include lots of Facebook-orientated features and integration . We 're not completely sold on the idea of a Facebook Phone , as the free application available on all the major mobile operating systems provides enough for most people 's activities on the move , and we 're seeing it integrated into the likes of our camera , contacts and media apps to allow for easy sharing 24/7 . Perhaps HTC is hoping that with the backing of Facebook the handset will achieve a large number of sales , as it looks to get back on track after slipping away from the likes of Samsung and Apple in the past six months or so .
Google , eBay , Amazon and Facebook have banded together to form `` The Internet Association '' in an effort to make their voices heard in the halls of Washington . The Internet Association states its objective as `` advancing public policy solutions to strengthen and protect an open , innovative and free internet '' . The group will be led by Michael Beckerman , former deputy staff director of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . In a statement , Beckerman said : `` ... the Internet 's decentralized and open model is what has enabled its unprecedented growth and innovation . We must guard against misguided attempts to handcuff this incredible source of job creation , freedom and creativity . '' It wo n't just be the giants of the industry involved , and with the group 's official launch in September will come a full list of sponsors and members . The group has been formed in order to tackle a number of issues that will have a direct effect upon their businesses including online sales tax and piracy and anti-piracy bills such as SOPA . Net neutrality laws are another high-profile issue that is likely to be high on the group 's agenda .

Web profiles may be coming to mobile-centric photo-sharing site Instagram after one web designer spotted a link that would allow users to view profiles online . As of now , there 's little you can do with Instagram 's website , aside from download the iPhone and Android apps or change account details . The company 's core experience comes though those apps , which allow users to see a feed of new photos and view the profile pages of those they follow . Naturally , photos can be viewed via direct web links , but members ca n't view their profile pages or browse photos using the Instagr.am site . Now Facebook , which acquired the company a billion dollars in cash and shares earlier this year , may be looking to the drop the entirely mobile-focused outlook . The reason for these suspicions arise from web designer Cole Reinke , who spotted a 'View Profile ' tab ( which soon disappeared ) while browsing around the site . The link went through to a 404 Error page , but its mere presence suggests something is definitely up . On his Tumblr blog Reinke posted : `` Online Instagram profiles coming soon ? Clicking on the link lead me to a 404 error at my profile address . When I looked to see if it was still there three hours later , it had disappeared . But before I saw the option appear , Instagram went down for a minute or two . '' If we had to guess , profile pages that Facebook is able to sell ads on are surely in the works . Via : TechCrunch

Say goodbye to lurking , snooping and curtain twitching , at least online : according to The Independent , Facebook 's going to start letting everybody in your social network see exactly what you 've been looking at - so if you 've been spending far too long , ahem , examining those beach photos of your ex , your best friend 's partner or a giant moose , everybody 's going to know about it . The Independent does n't quite put it that way - it says that `` the naughty-naughty-stalky-stalky generation may soon see their fingerprint-free snooping habits curtailed '' - but it 's clear that `` the end is nigh for anonymous stalking '' on the service . Oh no it is n't . I 'm the first to point the pointy finger of pointing at Facebook whenever it does something bad , which is pretty often , but in this case the Indy 's taken a story and stuck a made-up story on top of it . Facebook might be evil , but I do n't think it 's stupid . Here 's what Facebook is doing , as brilliantly described by Kate Solomon : it 's adding `` largely unnecessary group read-receipts '' so `` whenever you visit a Facebook group you can see exactly who has seen each post '' . That 's it . It 's an extension of the read receipts you already get in Facebook Messenger , and that you 've had in emails since 1922 . Could the same features come to your News Feed ? They could , and that 's the Indy 's take on it : `` already there are suggestions that Facebook may unfurl the technology across the site '' . But there 's a big difference between could and will , and I 'll be amazed if Facebook jumps from the former to the latter - not because of the privacy implications , but because of the pageviews . Facebook is all about ads , and those ads are all about keeping people on the site as much as possible - and I reckon read receipts on the News Feed is a sure-fire way to get people to spend less time on the network , not more . I do n't just mean because you 'll be caught if you 're stalking your ex . I mean because in the wrong hands , read notifications would make Facebook unusable . Imagine if the people in your network who post way too often , post too much stuff or post too much information - the people whose posts you 've relegated to `` important only '' , if you have n't shuffled them off to Siberia by sticking them in lists you never look at - could see exactly who did n't give a monkeys about their posts , and could see exactly how little of a monkeys people gave . It 'd be carnage . Facebook networks require a certain amount of fibbing , whether that 's accepting people as friends you 're not too fussed about or quietly hiding somebody 's posts instead of freaking out and telling them what you think of them , their job , their children and their haircut . From privacy settings to terrible mobile apps , Facebook has proved that it can survive all kinds of things - but just like real-life relationships , I 'm not convinced it could survive total transparency .

Facebook scans the posts and chat conversations of its users to check for criminal activity , a new report has revealed . The social network uses automated software to seek out inappropriate language in an attempt to snare sexual predators , Reuters reports . The article makes the example of a man in his 30s who arranged to meet a 13 year-old girl after middle school through Facebook chat . The software automatically flagged up the post to Facebook employees who alerted the police , who apprehended the man and took his computer . He denies charges . Law enforcement agents have praised Facebook for the speed of their response . `` There are companies out there that are doing a very good job , working within the confines of what they have available , '' said FBI agent Brooke Donahue . `` There are companies out there that are more concerned about profitability .

A new report from the BBC has warned that advertisers spending a fortune in an attempt to get their pages 'Liked ' on Facebook may be wasting their time . A popular Facebook page is considered one of the best ways to reach customers in the social media era as it delivers information directly to the news feed on products users have expressed interested in . However , an investigation has found that those liking the pages are n't always every day consumers , but computer-controlled spam profiles that are liking thousands of pages at a time . That means companies advertising their page on Facebook in an attempt to win those all-important 'Likes ' , may not be getting the right amount of bang for their buck . The BBC 's Rory Cellan-Jones put the theory to the test by setting up his advert for a bagel company targetted at the US and UK . Within days there were 3,000 likes from all over Asia . Facebook makes its money from these advertisers , so naturally has denied that this is a significant problem . The higher the Like count , the more it gets paid . The social network estimates that around 50 million of its 900m+ profiles may be fake . Via : BBC

Facebook is partying like its 1999 by adding read receipts to its group posts . Now , whenever you visit a Facebook group you can see exactly who has seen each post and when , which will no doubt appeal to those with stalker-ish tendencies . It 's not clear if you can turn this off if you do n't want it to be known that you were on Facebook reading a group post at 11.23am when you were supposed to be in that big marketing meeting on the third floor , but we 're trying to find out . For a friend . As well as the group 'improvements ' , Facebook has released a major update to its developer SDK that will make it easier and quicker for devs to create iOS apps for Facebook-integrated iOS apps . The SDK update also allows devs to make use of the iOS 6 native Facebook login , with backwards compatibility for all apps on iOS 4.0 onwards . Another treat for developers is the new iOS Developer Centre which offers help , tutorials and support in one handy place .
Facebook and NBC are expected to partner up for the upcoming 2012 Olympics , giving one company a stronger hook into the social media universe and the other an easy bit of publicity . However , not a dime is going to exchange hands between the social and broadcast giants as a result of the deal - it 's all content and promotion . On the NBC side of the equation , the network is expected to deliver exclusive content for Olympic fans who `` Like '' the company 's Facebook page dedicated to the events . And that includes the usual litany of tie-ins that will allow Facebook users to see when their friends watch related videos or read articles on NBC 's official 2012 Olympics site . NBC will run a `` Talk Meter '' poll during some parts of its Olympics coverage to gauge what Facebook users are chatting about in relation to the games . Facebook will also run an NBC-generated poll about the 2012 Olympics each day . `` We know that a social conversation will surround the Olympics , '' said NBC Olympics president Gary Zenkel in a published report . The Facebook partnership , he said , is the way that NBC can participate in the conversation as both a listener and voice . NBC also plans to use Facebook 's behind-the-scenes data on Olympic conversations and mentions to fuel related coverage and stories . However , Facebook 's not going to be NBC 's only source for real-time information related to popular opinion surrounding the 2012 Olympics . According to Zenkel , NBC plans to bring back the `` Twitter tracker '' that it used during its coverage of the 2012 Winter Games in Vancouver . The tracker served as a real-time visualization representative of the kinds of social updates that the network 's users were posting - when a ton of tweets flooded in about a particular athlete , his or her photos and overall presence in the tracker would grow as part of larger Olympic mosaic . When news about another athlete or situation grew in popularity , the mosaic 's boxes would shift around in proportion to accurately reflect Twitter users ' new opinions . Via The New York Times

We 've got ta say we 're a little fed up of tech companies constantly suing each other , so its nice to see two of the biggest resolve their differences amicably . Yahoo and Facebook have decided to put their long running disputes to bed and have agreed to work more closely together in the future . The ailing search company had alleged that Facebook was infringing on its advertising patents , while Facebook soon issued a countersuit alleging Yahoo preferred `` litigation over innovation . '' Now the companies have agreed to cross-license the relevant patent portfolios and expand their existing promotional agreements during major events . Facebook users will still be able to share Yahoo content . Facebook now says its looking forward to working with Yahoo in the future and the interim CEO Ross Levinson , who recently took over disgraced former boss Scott Thompson . `` I 'm pleased that we were able to resolve this in a positive manner and look forward to partnering closely with Ross and the leadership at Yahoo , '' said Sheryl Sandberg , Facebook 's Chief Operating Officer . Lets hope some of the other tech companies boring us with their endless court battles can take a note from these two . Yes , Apple and Samsung , we 're looking at you .

New cars are like giant , digital playgrounds . They sync with your smartphone , they read you your tweets , and they tell you which lane to get in after the traffic lights . But with all these new toys at your fingertips while you 're supposed to be – ahem – driving a car , preventing driver distraction is the next major hurdle for car manufacturers to overcome . Ford is aiming to tackle this problem in its Ford SYNC infotainment system by combining live telematics data from your car with real-time biometric information about you to decide when it 's safe to tell you about what @ dangrabham had for dinner and when it 's better to just keep schtum . `` We want to take information about what 's going on in the cabin - what the driver is doing - information about the vehicle response , about the environment , and we want to combine all of that into a mathematical model that says 'This is how we think the average person is going to be in this situation , ' '' Ford Senior Technical Leader , Jeff Greenberg told Gizmag . `` And then , looking even a little bit farther out , we 'd like to personalise that - not just how the average person would respond , but how you would respond . '' It 's pretty complicated when you think about it . Ford is talking about combining up-to-date information about the weather you 're driving through , the speed you 're travelling at , the traffic you 're experiencing and so on , with the time of day , your heart rate , how much you 're sweating , stress levels , body temperature and more . The aim is to produce an algorithm that calculates when a driver should be left to get on with driving and when it 's safe to interrupt . An easy one would be waiting until you 're stopped at traffic lights to read that tweet from your sister about forgetting your dad 's birthday . Oops . Via : Gizmag

According to a UK developer Facebook is to bring out a 'Want ' button to help businesses increase their social commerce sales and to complement the current 'Like ' button . The new Want plug-in was discovered by UK Facebook developer Tom Waddington in the Facebook Javascript software development kit ( SDK ) as an Extended Facebook Markup Language ( XFBML ) tag , and since he publicised the button , it 's mysteriously disappeared from the SDK . Although the functionality behind the botton is still in the SDK . Speaking on his blog Waddington said the button will only work on Open Graph objects marked as `` products , '' indicating it most likely to find it 's way in to social commerce use . Waddington has also found another example of an unreleased function aimed at social commerce called Facebook Social Context which allows a developer to take a list of keywords , find related Facebook brand pages and creates a list of friends who also like a brand or a product .

It 's apparently official Android-update day for some big-name apps , with both Facebook and Pandora adding new features today . Android users can more easily upload their photos to Facebook thanks to the latest app update . Rather than ponderously uploading each photo one by one , the photo upload feature now allows users to select multiple images to upload in one fell swoop then tag and caption to your liking . The Facebook app also adds the ability for users to create events right on their Android device , something still lacking from the iOS Facebook app . Facebook messaging also gets an enhancement with the ability to now include emoji characters and photos in your messages . Online radio app Pandora also sees an update today on Android , bringing it up to speed with the last month 's updates to the iOS app . The update gives Pandora a revamped UI , improving app navigation and giving it a blue and white color scheme that bears a striking resemblance to Facebook 's own . In terms of actual features , the Pandora app also now lets users browse song lyrics and artist bios on their Android device . Users can also rate and review songs that they have heard , as well as view similar tracks and artists to find new music . Both the Pandora and Facebook app updates are free to all users , and can be downloaded straight from the Google Play store .
Facebook is rolling out a new version of its iOS app , which it claims is twice as fast as the old edition . Facebook 5.0 for iOS should open , scroll and load pictures more quickly on iPad and iPhones because Facebook has rebuilt it completely from the ground up . A banner will let you know if new stories are posted while you 're scrolling through the news feed , and a nifty new swipe-to-close photos feature sounds handy too . Anyone who has used the Facebook iOS app until now will realise what a welcome upgrade this is ; the current edition was buggy , slow , tempermental , prone to crashing and generally frustrating . Android users may be feeling left out – Facebook tells us that although today 's announcement is only for the iOS app , `` We want to be as deeply integrated into phones as possible . This is the beginning . '' As well as the app update , Facebook has announced a few braggy stats about its mobile versions : in June alone , 543 million people used Facebook 's mobile products . The social network is now on over 7,000 mobile devices while over nine million apps and websites were integrated with Facebook as of March 2012 . Sounds like Facebook is going after mobile in a big way ; which will come as no surprise to anyone who remembers Zuck 's last comments on the subject of a Facebook phone . Facebook hardware , he said , `` really would n't make much sense for us to do '' but the network wants to be as `` deeply integrated as possible '' . Find the updated Facebook apps on iTunes later today .

Facebook got some good news Wednesday amid sinking stock prices and calls for Marc Zuckerberg 's head by ticked off investors . The social media megalith 's bid for photo-sharing site Instagram was approved by the Federal Trade Commission , sealing the deal with the conclusion of the agency 's standard-procedure investigation into the acquisition . While Facebook is probably excited to get the government 's go-ahead , Instagram might be a little glum over its final selling price . The deal , initially valued at $ 1 billion ( £629 million ) , dropped to a mere $ 747 million ( £470 ) . Facebook will payout $ 300 million ( £188 ) in cash with the remaining $ 447 million ( £281 ) coming in the form of stocks based on the company 's current trading value of $ 19.44 ( £12.24 ) a share . Thanks to the FCC 's 5-0 approval , the two sites can begin integrating their services . Facebook has to hope Instagram brings it some bucks as the company is facing investor pressure to produce some hard cash ( sorry , Farmville bucks ) . The company rolled out a sponsored results feature Wednesday it announced earlier this year . Now , when users look up a friend , place , page , etc. , paid sponsor results are interspersed with the search content . The feature comes at a time when Facebook is exploring other advertising options , like traditional banner ads , as its stock falls to half its initial IPO asking price . Though only a one-month test run , search result ads could become a permanent fixture on the site if they generate enough revenue - and brand awareness - for the sponsors .

A Chinese web company is suing Facebook , claiming it copied its Timeline feature . Cubic Network is a Pinterest-style start-up , founded four years ago . It launched its Timeline feature - which shows videos and pictures in chronological order , much like Facebook 's - back on February 9 , 2008 . Harvard graduate Xiong Wanli started Cubic Network , and held a talk at Stanford university about the Timeline feature . Mark Zuckerberg attended the talk , according to the China Youth Daily . Facebook launched its own Timeline feature in 2011 , three years after Cubic Network 's . It was made available to everyone in December of last year . Cubic Network knew of the potential patent infringement when Facebook announced the feature , but only decided to bring about the action after consulting US lawyers . Wanli also claims the logo of Facebook 's F8 developer conference is too similar to Cubic 's own logo . He notes Cubic Network 's R & D centre was called F8 before Facebook named its annual conference . Facebook 's very founding was the subject of a legal dispute between Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss brothers . The dispute was the basis of the film The Social Network . A Chinese company tried to sue Apple recently over the iPad name . Proview launched its iPad desktop PC back in 2000 . Ironically , it actually looked quite a lot like an old iMac . Apple bought the iPad trademark prior to launching its tablet , but Proview claimed it committed fraud by concealing its identity . Apple settled the case for $ 60m last month . Via The Register

Facebook is now the worst-performing IPO since records began , according to Bloomberg . Shares dropped to a brutal $ 19.05 ( £12.13 ) in New York on Friday evening after restrictions on its largest 'insider ' investors selling shares were lifted on Thursday . Compared to the opening price of $ 38 , the social network has lost 50 per cent of its value since the floatation in May , including a 4.1 per cent fall on Friday . More sales restrictions are expected to be lifted in the coming months , so Facebook 's stock may remain in the doldrums for quite some time yet . Despite $ 600m ( £382m ) being knocked off his personal fortune on Thursday ( do n't worry , he 's still worth about $ 10 billion ) and more on Friday , experts believe Mark Zuckerberg will be relatively unworried by the recent slump . David Kirkpatrick , author of The Facebook Effect , told Business Week : `` ( Zuckerberg ) thinks of it only in terms of how it affects the company 's strategic and tactical opportunities . '' However , he added that `` The market is not convinced of Facebook 's future . '' Via : Bloomberg , Business Week

The Federal Trade Commission has been investigating Facebook 's violation of its users ' privacy for nearly three years . Today , an agreement was reached between the FTC and the social network , which requires Facebook to obtain `` expressed consent '' and give any user `` clear and prominent notice '' when any private information is shared . In addition to Facebook having to get permission to share private information , Mark Zuckerberg 's company also agreed to pay fines upwards of $ 16,000 for every violation . The deep look into Facebook 's privacy problems began in 2009 , when it was discovered the company was divulging the private information of users who had opted out of sharing . As per the agreement , Facebook will have to implement and track a `` comprehensive privacy program , '' which will be subject to inspection every two years . A third party will audit the records of this program for the next 20 years . However , by agreeing to the FTC 's deal , Facebook exonerates itself from ever having to admit fault in any of the allegations previously levied against it . In closing , the FTC stated , `` We intend to monitor closely Facebook 's compliance with the order , and will not hesitate to seek civil penalties for any violations . '' This latest result comes in the wake of Thursday 's news of Google paying a $ 22.5 million fine to the FTC for misrepresenting its ad tracking . Via SlashGear , The Verge
Samsung Mobile South Africa has just posted a photo of an unknown handset , with a cryptic caption of `` share the entertainment '' on its Facebook page . Spotted by a TechRadar tipster , the handset appears to sport a similar design to the new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 – with dual speakers at the top and bottom of the device , which also features a metallic boarder surrounding the front of the phone . However we know it 's not a tablet , as there is a physical home button flanked by two touch keys below the screen – sporting a very similar look to the setup on the Galaxy S2 . Of course people may jump straight to thinking that this is an early leak of the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 , however closer inspection would suggest otherwise , with the screen not appearing big enough to be the successor to the gigantic 5.3-inch display of the original Galaxy Note . The design is reminiscent of a supposed leaked shot of the Galaxy S3 , which turned out to be a fake – but Samsung may still be considering the slightly unusual design for future handsets . Just the other day we saw Samsung Pakistan accidentally post a photo on its Facebook page , claiming first to be the Galaxy S3 and then re-posting it as the Note – both of which were incorrect and quickly removed . So we 're not holding out too much hope that this is a bona fide press shot , as it could just as easily be another fake , but it 's got our attention - for now . Thanks to @ BrianLatouf for the tip !

How does Facebook decide which of its numerous features eventually get integrated into the site as a whole ? A brand-new blog post by Facebook 's director of engineering , Andrew `` Boz '' Bosworth , spills the beans on how tweaks and new updates make it from observation and hypothesis to real-world integration ( or Facebook 's scrap pile ) . Turns out Facebook uses a number of methods , including audience segmentation , to determine which features are ultimately worth rolling out to its 955-plus million active users ( minus those 83 million fake ones ) . It 's a fascinating read , one that pulls back the curtain around Facebook 's `` ship early , ship often '' mantra just a wee bit more than before . Or , as Bosworth puts it , `` When you see such dramatic results from the smallest tweaks , you realize how much opportunity there is to improve things - and we feel a constant sense of urgency to do so . '' According to Bosworth , Facebook runs `` hundreds '' of daily tests to help maximize the site experience for its users . A majority of these tests are relatively minor . For example , Bosworth talks about reducing the number of Facebook users shown on the site 's `` Find Friends '' feature by 60 percent but increasing the size of users present ( and the button to friend them ) . In other words , it 's not as if huge subsets of Facebook users are seeing a significantly altered experience when they load up the site versus when their friends load up the site . That said , Bosworth does note that , `` the odds are good that everyone on Facebook has been , at some time , part of a test . '' `` We know this can be annoying so we do our best to minimize the impact of these tests , but the fact we are willing to incur it at all should make it clear how deeply we believe that they are one of our best opportunities to make the product better , '' he adds . Key to Facebook 's segmentation - which allows the site to test audiences based on random samples of its population , samples based on regions or a variety of other characteristics - is an internal Facebook tool called `` Gatekeeper . '' The digital traffic cop allows Facebook to ensure that different tests do n't overlap among the same audiences and , more importantly , to ensure that the results generated by Facebook 's armada of different setups give the company statistically significant recommendations - for better or worse . `` When a test goes out we look at the data immediately and adapt the products quickly . We do this on a daily basis , '' Bosworth writes . `` This cycle of iteration is the engine of progress and the people who use Facebook are not just the beneficiaries but are also intimately a part of the process .

The Australian Advertising Standards Board ( ASB ) has pronounced that any business is not only liable for comments made by the business on Facebook , but also for any comments made by customers on the businesses Facebook pages . The case involved a complaint to the ASB about Smirnoff vodka 's Australian Facebook page , which was accused of `` violating standards with sexist , obscene Facebook content that also promoted underage drinking . '' `` A bewildering decision with potentially wide ranging implications '' Phil Rothwell , Sales and Marketing Director , SellerDeck Diageo , Smirnoff 's parent company argued that Smirnoff 's Facebook page was a networking tool for communication between company and customer and not a medium for advertising . However this was rejected by the ASB , who ruled that while the Facebook page did n't promote underage drinking , the Facebook pages did need to adhere to advertising industry codes , and the business was responsible for any user-generated comments that followed its own advertising messages . The consequences of this ruling are significant , John Swinson , a partner at Australian lawyers King & Wood Mallesons said `` If , for example , a user claimed that Smirnoff vodka was the purest Russian vodka or it could lead to success with women , the company would be liable on multiple counts . '' Speaking to Techradar Phil Rothwell , Sales and Marketing Director at SellerDeck , commented on the ruling . `` This is a bewildering decision with potentially wide ranging implications . It seems to assert that comments posted by customers on a fanzine site are , in essence , advertising . `` People do n't have an innate right to say what they want without consequence , but describing Smirnoff as 'Russian vodka ' is some way off deriding people with malicious intent . I can understand why Russian distillers find it irritating , but this response is over the top and potentially counterproductive . `` The end result is n't going to help anyone . We ca n't expect the general public to be 100 per cent accurate on postings and expecting them to adhere to advertising rules is ridiculous . Are Australian diners going to be barred from offering 'English Breakfasts ' ? It 's the stuff of nonsense . '' While the ruling applies to just Australia , the law may be used as a model elsewhere in the World .

Are Facebook `` likes '' free speech ? The company who propagated the term and is at the center of an unfair firing suit seems to think it is . Facebook has come forward to defend a Virginia deputy sheriff who was fired for `` liking '' the Facebook page of his boss 's political opponent . A court ruled that `` likes '' are not protected speech , and therefore Daniel Ray Carter 's termination was within the bounds of constitutional law . But Facebook disagrees , and the social networking giant filed a briefing with the court in anticipation of Carter 's upcoming appeal . In the document , Facebook calls out Judge Raymond Jackson for having `` a misunderstanding of the nature of the communication at issue . '' `` Facebook , for itself and its Users , has a vital interest in ensuring that speech on Facebook and in other online communities is afforded the same constitutional protection as speech in newspapers , on television , and in the town square , '' the company wrote in the brief . `` If Carter had stood on a street corner and announced , ' I like Jim Adams for Hampton Sheriff , ' there would be no dispute that his statement was constitutionally protected speech , '' the document continues . It even calls `` likes , '' `` the 21st-century equivalent of a front-yard campaign sign . '' Facebook 's arguments are quite persuasive , and the experts at the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) have even released a statement applauding the California company for its stance . `` The Supreme Court has made clear that the First Amendment protects everyone 's right to express their thoughts and opinions in whatever form they choose to do so , whether it 's speaking on a street corner , holding up a sign , or pressing a button on Facebook to say that you 'Like ' something , '' the ACLU 's Aden Fine said in a statement emailed to TechRadar . `` Facebook should be applauded for filing this brief to support the free speech rights of its users . `` Facebook has become a means of communication for tens of millions of Americans , and if basic activity on Facebook such as 'liking ' were denied First Amendment protection , the free expression of ideas that the First Amendment is meant to safeguard would be severely limited . '' What makes this case different from others involving employees ' speech ? `` The big difference is that this is a government employer , and government can not fire public employees based on their speech activities , '' ACLU Senior Staff Attorney Fine told TechRadar on the phone today . Whereas `` generally speaking , private companies are not bound by the First Amendment , '' he added . So Pizza Hut employees should n't be tweeting their love of Domino 's , but City Hall clerks should be free to support any candidate they want in any manner they choose , the ACLU contends . As others have pointed out , the ultimate decision here could set a major precedent for emerging forms of speech , like Facebook `` likes '' and even Twitter re-tweets . Given responses to the case so far , it seems Judge Jackson is in fact wrong , so let 's hope Carter 's appeal and the combined statements of Facebook and the ACLU can sway him .
The current trend for big-money bingo has hit Facebook in the form of a real-cash gambling app called Bingo & Slots Friendzy . The app , the name of which sets the expectation bar fairly low , is Facebook 's first app that allows gambling with real money and is available only to UK users of the social network . In line with UK law , you 'll have to be 18 to chance your arm at some real cash prizes , with stringent `` account acceptance controls verifying their identity '' in place to stop younger players . Given that gambling is an addictive pastime , all users will also `` have access to a number of self-help tools to limit their spending and exclude themselves from playing at any time '' . The UK is the `` lucky '' first country to get a social gambling app because of its `` mature and very well-regulated gambling market '' – non UK users wo n't see any stories generated by the gambling app in their news feeds , nor will they be able to access the applications from the Facebook App Center . Outside the UK , Facebookers will have to make do with chancing pretend money on apps like Zynga Bingo and Zynga Poker . The app has been created by Gamesys , the company behind Jackpot Joy and those irritating Barbara Windsor adverts . Jackpotjoy MD Michael Saunders said , `` We 've reinvented our exclusive Bingo and Slots games to appeal to the UK Facebook community . This marks an exciting turning point for the industry and a milestone for the Gamesys business . '' Meanwhile , a Facebook spokesperson made the point that the app is not a joint venture and has been developed entireley by Gamesys . They justified the move in a statement to us : `` Real money gaming is a popular and well-regulated activity in the UK and we are allowing a partner to offer their games to adult users on the Facebook platform in a safe and controlled manner . '' Of course , there 'll be a lot of money in it for Facebook if the bingo game takes off – there has n't been any discussion of figures in the press materials , but given that Facebook was making 12 per cent of its income from Zynga back in February 2012 by taking a 30 per cent cut of Zynga 's in-game purchases , you can bet that Facebook 's taking no small cut . And you know what they say : the house always wins .

Facebook is likely to give users the opportunity to edit those status faux-pas , according to one of the company 's project managers . Vadim Lavrusik hinted that the recently-introduced ability to edit comments on statuses , could soon be followed up by the chance to wipe out typos , errors and inappropriate comments on our own updates . Currently , the only way to cover out tracks is to completely delete the initial post and re-post the edited status with fewer mistakes or explosive comments . Speaking at a journalism conference Lavrusik reportedly said : `` On Facebook , you can edit captions and you can edit comments . You can infer what we will do next . '' When pushed , he added : `` I can tell you that users have asked for ( editable statuses ) a lot and a lot of times that 's how we develop things . '' Lavrusik stopped short of actually confirming the feature and a Facebook spokesman added that while it may be something the social network will consider in the future , `` there 's nothing to announce at this time .

Facebook 's market shares maybe suffering but the social media giant is n't shying away from launching new features and ventures , including a whole new website : FacebookStories.com . An independent destination , Facebook Stories aims to `` share the stories of people using Facebook in extraordinary ways . '' `` This site will share some of the most extraordinary , quirky and thought-provoking stories and ideas from the more than 950 million people around the world who comprise the social graph , '' explains Johanna Peace , a Facebook spokeswoman . With a magazine look and documentary-style format - with undertones of Timeline - the site explores stories centered on a different theme each month . This month 's it 's `` Remembering . '' Highlighted on the site is the saga of Mayank Sharma , a New Delhi man who lost his memory after contacting meningitis . In a two minute-plus video , Sharma says he woke up one day and `` remembered nothing , '' losing 27 years of memories and people . Thanks to Facebook 's `` People You May Know '' feature , Sharma 's been able reconstruct some pieces of his life lost to the disease . Sharma 's not the only featured Facebooker up now and anyone can submit their stories ( after accepting a Facebook Stories app ) , though final selection is left to the Facebook team . According to Peace , Facebook hopes that by spotlighting the stories of its users , people can connect and share innovative ways to accomplish the impossible . `` We hope to inspire people to find new uses for these technologies within their own lives , '' she said . Stories also includes a Bookshelf feature , a list of `` Goodreads '' to help users `` dig deeper into each month 's theme . '' Another literary element , the Reading List , gives exclusive access to magazine , newspaper and other publications ' archives , like pieces from The New Yorker up now . A Spotify-powered Playlist curates music from various , genre-hopping artists . On the site now is a Playlist of tunes inspired by Gameboy games . Finally , Peace said Facebook has created an infographic based on each month 's theme , examining the major life events from around the world posted on users ' Timelines . For `` Remembering , '' a graphic representing major milestones like travel , moving , marriage , dating and birth was created . Travel , it turns out , is the top milestone making it 's way onto users ' profiles , with older people posting more travel stories . Canadians apparently share their travel stories with more people than in any other country . Teenagers , unsurprisingly , post the most about their relationships with Turkish citizens sharing the most New Relationships , Indonesian residents posting the most engagements and people in Brazil the most marriages . According to Peace , `` getting glasses '' is a major life event in Japan with the country posting more stories about this than any other .
83 million Facebook users are fake , according to the social network 's legal company filings . Zuck and co reported that 8.7 per cent of the 955 million active Facebook accounts may be dummy or fake profiles . Around 4.8 per cent of accounts are thought to be duplicate profiles , while 2.4 per cent can be attributed to misclassified accounts ( businesses , parodies and , ugh , pets ) and 1.5 per cent are described as `` undesirable '' . These `` undesirables '' are accounts the break Facebook 's rules and include those that send out reams of spam messages and the like . `` We believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the United States or Australia and higher in developing markets such as Indonesia and Turkey , '' Facebook said in its filing . The problem with fake accounts – aside from being annoying for the rest of us - is that they mess with Facebook 's ability to serve targeted adverts on the site , as well as skewing the metrics that the social network supplies to its advertisers . And with Facebook 's stock up and down like a yoyo , keeping those advertisers happy is more important than ever . From BBC

Facebook has tweaked its Messenger app for iOS . The changes mirror those rolled out to the Android version of the instant messaging application on September 20 . The most important of which will allow iPhone , iPad and iPad touch users to swipe to the left to see which of their contacts is online and available Another update enables users to keep their favourite friends at the top of the online list to reduce the need to scroll through the entire contacts list . Messages now appear as speech bubbles , giving conversations an altogether more attractive look , similar to the iOS Messages and SMS applications . The new version of Messenger , which has also been optimised for the iPhone 5 's 4-inch widescreen , also brings improved speed and reliability , along with a host of bug fixes . It can be downloaded now from the App Store .

For those special moments when `` likes '' are n't enough for your closest Facebook friends , the social networking website has introduced a new gifting program starting today . Different from the virtual gifts program introduced a couple of years ago , Facebook Gifts enables users to easily ship physical presents to one another without having to leave the comfort of their newsfeed . It all starts with by clicking a gift box icon in their newsfeed 's birthday reminder sidebar or on their friend 's timeline . Cupcakes , teddy bears , and gift cards are just some of the examples of what users can expect to receive if they have a particularly persistent secret admirer . `` There are over a hundred partners offering hundreds of gifts , '' a Facebook representative told TechRadar . `` Partners include Starbucks , GUND , Magnolia Bakery in NYC , Magnolia Bakery , Happy Socks , Vosges Haut-Chocolat , The Honest Company , Cheryl 's Cookies by 1800 Flowers ( $ 5 cookie greetings ) , Malin + Goetz and Chocomize . '' The real gift may be for Facebook . The company has struggled to monetize its increasing mobile traffic , said to be more than half of the visitors accessing the website on a daily basis . `` This is truly the heart and soul of Karma , re-imagined inside of Facebook , '' said Lee Linden , head of Facebook Gifts , in an interview with AllThingsD . `` And it all works perfectly on the phone . '' Yes , Facebook Gifts will work the same way on a tablet or phone as it does on a computer . It wo n't be a newsfeed-cluttering annoyance either and should make Facebook money in the end . This win-win extends to Facebook gift givers , too , who have almost all of the work done for them . `` Choose a gift , attach a card and send , '' Facebook said in a news release . `` You can post your gift to your friend 's timeline or send it privately . Your friend can then unwrap a preview of the gift and it will show up on their doorstep a few days later . '' In addition to taking care of the shipping , Facebook gives them the option to pay right away or add payment details later on . They do n't even have to worry filling out an address form , as the friend provides it . Putting the gift-receiving friend in charge of the address is good for two reasons : it keeps their location anonymous ( just in case ) , and it allows them to control where things go ( if they recently moved , for example ) . They can also be put in charge of choosing the flavor , color , and size , great for guys who do n't want to `` go there '' with that question . Exchanging the gift for something of equal value is also possible - no hard feelings or frowny emoticon faces . In a surprise move , this Facebook Gifts idea is friending Android before iOS . However , most users wo n't notice any gifts no matter which mobile platform they utilize . `` Facebook Gifts will roll out gradually , first to people in the U.S. , '' Facebook 's release said . Everything from Facebook Chat to Timeline has followed this slow release pattern . Facebook also told TechRadar that Apple fans should expect `` a wider roll-out to iOS devices in a few weeks . '' In the meantime web and desktop versions are available to select users .

With nary a regard for the season , Facebook has begun spring cleaning its users by wiping out all fake accounts and bogus Page Likes . Some business pages dropped tens of thousands of likes ( take a bow , Zynga Poker ) while others have noticed no change whatsoever ( hello , TechRadar ) . It 's all come about as part of Facebook 's 'integrity updates ' which it announced after a BBC bagel-based exposé that amassed 3,000 likes for a new page in just a few days . Unless the page owner has been buying in fake likes , Facebook explained that , `` On average , less than 1 % of Likes on any given Page will be removed . '' For the rest of us non-business users , we should also see a drop in spam friend requests and spammy comments on pages we like . And that , we like . We also like the new inclusion of Dropbox in Facebook Groups – you 'll be able to share files with the group , then discuss whatever it is at length through the medium of likes and comments .

Facebook and popular cloud storage service Dropbox have announced a new partnership , which will allow files to be shared easily between members of Facebook Groups . The accord will let users instantly post uploaded notes , videos , schedules , or photos directly onto the Group 's wall once the Facebook and Dropbox accounts are linked . Group members will receive a notification whenever the shared file is edited and hence will always be able to view the newest version . Recipients will also be able to like and comment on a post as they normally would . Naturally , files will need to be uploaded through one of the various Dropbox apps before they can be offered to the group . In a post on its official blog , Dropbox engineer Chris Varenhorst wrote : `` Today we 're psyched to announce that you can share stuff from Dropbox right inside Facebook Groups ! `` Now you can share notes with your study group , add the latest game schedule to your basketball team 's group , or post a birthday video to your family 's group at lightning speed from wherever you are . '' Dropbox said the feature is gradually being rolled out from Wednesday on , so if you 're not seeing it already , expect it to show up in the very near future . With Dropbox offering plenty of free storage and detailed applications for PC , Mac , iOS , and Android , this new arrangement certainly gives Group members an easier means of sharing the latest information .

Facebook users in the U.S. , U.K. , and Germany can now charge purchases made through the mobile site directly to their phone bill , the company powering the service announced Monday . The service , which was first announced in February and gradually started rolling out in July , is powered by Bango , which offers a like-minded service for the BlackBerry App World and the Google Play store . Now that it 's live in those countries , Bango lets anyone using the Facebook mobile website buy Facebook Credits for games or virtual gifts without entering credit card details or using costly text-messaging services . Bango , which is also working on a payment solution with Amazon , revealed the link-up Monday in a regulatory filing , and also vowed to bring the service to more countries by the end of the year . It also announced its Facebook billing service will start rolling out to other countries later this year . From its perspective , Facebook likely hopes the deal will increase its chances of making some shareholder-pleasing money from its ever-growing proportion of mobile traffic . Advertising has been a focus of the mobile-minded Facebook , but clearly the social network wants to prove it 's more than just a one-trick mobile pony . According to Bango , Facebook can now expect to achieve a 77 percent purchase conversion rate , compared with the 40 percent conversion rate enjoyed by other bill-to-mobile methods . `` Conventional operator billing is expected to achieve a 40 percent conversion rate , '' the company said in a blog post . `` Put simply , most mobile commerce customers who click 'buy , ' do not successfully buy . Billing with the Bango payment platform delivers an average conversion rate of 77 percent . Most users who click 'buy , ' do buy . '' Via TechCrunch , Bango

Facebook has switched off its photo facial recognition technology in the EU following a privacy probe from regulators . The service , which automatically suggests people to tag by scanning faces within the photos , was deemed a threat to privacy , according to the Irish data protection commission . Billy Hawkes , who led the initial investigation and subsequent audit , said Facebook had gone beyond recommendations by totally abandoning the face-rec tech in the EU . `` I am particularly encouraged in relation to the approach it has decided to adopt on the tag suggest/facial recognition feature by in fact agreeing to go beyond our initial recommendations , in light of developments since then , in order to achieve best practice , '' he said . The social network faces a fine of up to £80,000 of it does not comply fully with recommendations in other areas , but said it was keen to comply with EU guidelines and maintain its own high standards . A Facebook spokesperson said : `` As our regulator in Europe , the Irish office of the data protection commissioner is constantly working with us to ensure that we keep improving on the high standards of control that we have built into our existing tools .

Facebook has pounded out a handful of updates and trials over the last few days , least of which is a test-run of a new `` Photo Sync '' service for its Android app . The Photo Sync functionality , currently open to a select group of users , automatically uploads a photograph to Facebook as soon as it 's snapped by a user 's smartphone camera . All photos remain in a private folder named `` Synced from Phone , '' rather than the alternative of potentially compromising pictures appearing directly on the Timeline . Facebook has n't revealed if and when the feature will be rolling out to all users . Beyond Photo Sync , the company has also updated its Facebook for Android and Facebook Messenger apps to enable a new text message-like conversation view for messages . The apps have also received a significant speed and reliability boost , while users of the standalone Messenger tool can now simply swipe to the left to see who 's online . The Messenger update also lets certain smartphone users - those with HTC 's Evo 3D and One X , LG 's Optimus Black and Optimus Hub , and Samsung 's Galaxy Ace , Galaxy Nexus , Galaxy S3 , and Galaxy Y - to send texts to their contacts inside Messenger . As for Facebook for Android , it now has a button in the News Feed 's upper-right hand corner that shows which contacts are available to chat . The app will also show who 's active in order to gauge a message 's response time . Users can pick up the updates in the Google Play store . The update comes about a month after Facebook significantly updated its iOS app - making it twice as fast as its sluggish predecessor These Android updates are n't as severe , but CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised a native Facebook for Android client is on the way . Meanwhile , in a bid to secure some shareholder-pleasing profits from its mobile app , Reuters reported that Facebook is about to start charging businesses to use Offers . The Groupon-like Facebook Offers service launched last year and allows local businesses to tempt Facebookers with deals from within their vicinity . To establish the service , Facebook had offered it to businesses for free , but now they 'll have to pay `` at least $ 5 '' ( £3 ) to run the ads , according to Reuters . As part of the update , businesses will also have the opportunity to include a QR code into their deals , meaning transactions are now likely to take place outside of Facebook itself .
In a speech by Salesforce.com CEO Mark Benioff at the companies Dreamforce 2012 conference in San Francisco the CEO explained why businesses needed to follow Facebook if they wanted to succeed . `` Facebook is the most popular app on the planet , '' Benioff claims . `` All software is going to look like Facebook ; everybody is going to have to rewrite [ their software ] to have a feed based program with status updates because this is what users have been trained to . [ Salesforce ] needs to be modern , it needs to stay up to date . We need a feed based user interface . We need to run on mobile devices . We need to do all these things . And we have the opportunity because we 're updating our platform three times a year . '' Salesforce has to keep adding new features to stay relevant , Benioff says ; `` I think it 's critical today for platforms to have this kind of next generation file management , which looks a lot like what Dropbox looks like ; obviously Google feels that way , with Google Drive , and Microsoft feels that way , with SkyDrive . '' But it 's Facebook that Salesforce is really taking as a model .

Apple rolled out an update to Mac OS X Mountain Lion Wednesday that brings with it system-wide Facebook integration .

We are hours away from HTC `` see what 's next '' event and the company , playing coy , posted an official teaser on its Facebook page Tuesday afternoon to whet our whistles . Just the corner of a phone is visible , though what we can see what appears to be the clock of a Windows Phone , giving enough of a hint as to what we can expect Wednesday morning . The picture is also accompanied by the caption : `` When beautiful hardware meets stunning software . '' Could HTC not only be playing up its new design but also what we 'll find inside ? A leaked image purportedly of the HTC Accord ( also known as the HTC 8X ) , a Windows Phone 8 handset , also emerged Tuesday . Whether this device , if authentic , and the Facebook teaser are one in the same , we wo n't know until Wednesday , Sept. 19 . TechRadar will be at the New York City event live , bringing you all the latest from HTC as it happens . From Facebook via Engadget
Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg was n't kidding when he reportedly said `` mobile is everything '' during the TechCrunch Disrupt conference last week . The social network on Tuesday announced two new fronts to its mobile ad strategy : a new version of Pages Manager and the beginnings of an off-site ad network . Pages Manager now allows administrators to promote their pages via an iPhone or iPad app . For a fee , admins - ostensibly business owners - can choose which posts they 'd like to promote directly from their iOS mobile devices . Small businesses had reportedly been asking for the mobile ad-buying capability for some time . The company also announced Tuesday that it has entered a test period for an off-site ad network that puts Facebook ads on non-Facebook mobile apps and web pages . The ads are similar to ones already found on Facebook , just optimized for other sites and the mobile web . Zuck 's team is currently working with a select number of ad exchanges with existing publisher relationships , according to a published report . The plan is for those publishers to turn around and sell the Facebook-styled ads to third-party applications and websites . `` Right now we 're testing to see how these ads perform , whether people find them relevant . They could be an interesting way to discover new mobile apps and see relevant ads off of Facebook , '' Facebook told TechCrunch 's Josh Constine . From an advertiser 's perspective , they have access - for a price - to all the data Facebook has gathered on its users . That data allows them to get the most bang for their advertising buck . `` With Facebook you have really great targeting , '' the company said to Constine . `` They 'll be able to reach people that are more likely to engage with the ads they see . '' Developers who place ads on third-party apps and sites that direct users to app download stores like Apple 's App Store and Google Play are likely looking forward to the network , as are marketers who can now produce uber-honed ads . Facebook assured Constine no identifiable data would be shared with advertisers ... just accept the possibility highly personalized ads will pop up on your screens when you 're not logged into your profile page .
Twitter has revealed that it is getting a new look , with the micro-blog redesigning its profile pages . Now , and this may sound familiar to Facebook users , Twitter allows users to upload a new header photo which will appear whether you view a profile on the web or through the service 's myriad apps . So far so Facebook Timeline , but Twitter reckons the new design is all about bringing meaning to Twitter profiles . `` Starting today you can make your presence on Twitter more meaningful with new Twitter profiles , '' explained the blog . `` New profiles help you get to know people better through their pictures . Photo streams now appear below anyone 's most recent Tweets on iPhone , Android and iPad . `` Swipe through the stream to see the photos other users have shared or tap any thumbnail to view their photos in fullscreen . '' If you want to see these new profiles in action then head over to @ todayshow where they have already made use of the new look .

The majority of prospective job candidates change their social media profiles and edit out the the unflattering pictures and improve their career prospects before an interview , according to a new survey by recruitment business Hays . In a survey of over 770 people , more than half ( 55 % ) of respondents admitted to changing their privacy settings when job searching , to make sure that personal information does not influence their chances of success in finding a new job . Going one step further , one in ten of those surveyed admitted editing content and untagging photos of themselves posted online when looking for a job . Mark Sheldon , Regional Managing Director at Hays says : `` While no employer should make a hiring decision based entirely on what they see online , it 's now extremely easy for an employer to find out an incredible amount of personal detail with just a quick search . '' While more than half alter their Facebook profiles there are still a significant number of prospective job candidates who make no effort whatsoever to edit out those dodgy moments on holiday , and the quotes about avoiding work because they 're too hungover . The survey found that more than a third ( 36 % ) did not think an employer would look at their profiles , and so made no changes to their social media habits when looking for a new job .

Mark Zuckerberg , much maligned for Facebook 's disappointing IPO , touched on his company 's loses at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference Tuesday before turning to something he 'd much rather talk about : making money . Zuckerberg reportedly said that `` mobile is everything , '' and that the company 's laying its chips on ad revenue coming from handsets , not desktops . Mobile is Zuckerberg 's - and therefore Facebook 's - ace in the hole . Users of the company 's new iOS app are consuming twice as many feed stories as before , Zuckerberg said , pointing to a boon of potential future ad revenue . Though the iOS update did n't do much to change the look of the app , Zuckerberg said the app 's performance got a much needed bump . A mobile misstep the company 's already suffered through is HTML5 , with Zuckerberg explaining the social site leaned too heavily on it rather than native apps . That 's all changing though , as Zuck touted the iOS app , and an upcoming integration with iOS 6 . Most signs point to the new OS finding its first home in the iPhone 5 , ( probably ) launching Wednesday . Zucks also said a native Android app is the third prong of its mobile strategy after iOS and mobile web , and users can expect one before too long . Also on tap for the site are a search engine , a natural progression for a company seeing 1 billion queries a day . As for a Facebook phone , Zuckerberg called such a handset `` the wrong strategy '' for the company , running counter to the company 's strategy of being on all mobile phones . Finally , Zuckerberg said not to expect anything to change with Instagram , which Facebook officially acquired last week . `` Our mission with Instagram is we want to help them grow to hundreds of millions of users , '' he said . `` We have no agenda with making them go into our infrastructure .

Instagram is now officially a Facebook-owned company after the pair closed the long-pending deal . The takeover , which was agreed in principle back in April , has been subject to probes from the Office of Fair Trading in the UK and the FTC in the United States , delaying official confirmation . Neither regulatory body felt the deal would adversely affect competition and green-lit the acquisition , which has now been rubber stamped . On Thursday , Instagram founder Kevin Systrom posted on Facebook : `` Very excited to announce that we 're now officially joining the Facebook family . `` I 'm psyched for the next chapter of this long journey . '' Facebook stumped up $ 300m in cash for Instagram , while also offering 23 million shares . Initially , the deal was worth around a billion dollars , but Facebook shares have been cut in half from $ 38 to $ 19 since then , which wipes around $ 350m off the original deal . Facebook has vowed to continue running Instagram as a standalone company , while it is thought that the app will help Facebook develop its own mobile strategy . Instagram already has 50 million users and that 's sure to swell significantly as the tie-ins between the two companies become more visible . Via : BBC

Facebook 's stock price reached a new low of $ 17.55 today before closing at $ 17.73 - a 53.34 percent drop since its $ 38 IPO in May . Before hitting this record low , Facebook shares began the day at $ 18.06 . One of the many reasons Facebook continues to be the worst-performing IPO since records began is the initial round of lockup expirations . Employees and insiders , once restricted from selling their stock , have had the green light to sell up to 271 million shares since Aug. 16 . Among the notable insiders to take advantage of this lockup expiration are Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and first outside investor Peter Thiel . Moskovitz , who left the company in 2008 , sold 450,000 of his shares to the tune of $ 8.8 million . He still owns 133 million Facebook shares . Thiel meanwhile unloaded 20 million shares , earning almost $ 400 million from that trade and a total of $ 640 million since the Facebook IPO . Even with the stock price down more than half since its debut on the NASDAQ , Thiel made a healthy return on his $ 500,000 investment in the up-and-coming social media company . Facebook 's stock could dip even lower , as there are three more of these lockup expirations to go and more than 1.5 billion shares that will move from restricted status to free-to-sell . BMO Financial Group did have a brighter outlook beyond that period , though . `` We expected investor attention to return to fundamentals after the technical challenges presented by lockup expirations over the next six months have been absorbed by the stock , '' said BMO 's Daniel Salmon . Those fundamentals include a clearer vision of Facebook 's business strategy and adaptation to advertising on mobile platforms . Apps and mobile browsers are two of the ways Facebook 's nearly one billion active users are increasingly accessing the site . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has stated that the company is `` focused on investing in our priorities of mobile , platform and social ads to help people have these experiences with their friends . '' In June , the new Sponsored Stories brought in $ 1 million each day , half of which came from mobile users . Zuckerberg will make his first on-stage interview since May 's IPO at TechCrunch Disrupt next Tuesday . We 'll likely hear more about Facebook 's troubled IPO and its mobile strategy then .

Facebook has made a couple of behind-the-scenes tweaks to automatically weasel out and delete fake Likes . The social network says that the new improvements to `` site integrity systems '' will identify and take action against Likes acquired by way of malware or `` other forms of deception '' . `` On average , less than 1 % of Likes on any given page will be removed , providing they and their affiliates have been abiding by our terms , '' said Facebook Security in a blog post . `` These newly improved automated efforts will remove those likes gained by malware , compromised accounts , deceived users or purchased bulk Likes , '' it continued . `` While we have always had dedicated protections against each of these threats on Facebook , these improved systems have been specifically configured to identify and take action against suspicious Likes . '' The internal tweaks come after outcry over the number of fraudulent likes on brand pages , prompted by a BBC investigation that managed to amass 3,000 Likes for a pretend bagel business in just a few days .

Facebook came clean about its plans for the future in an earnings call yesterday , talking up the potential for its mobile business and healthier-than-expected income for Q3 2012 . Having revealed that Facebook made over 14 per cent of its advertising income from mobile ads ( equating to around $ 150 million/ £92m/ AU $ 144m ) , CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors that mobile is a key part of the company 's future . `` I think our opportunity on mobile is the most misunderstood aspect of Facebook today , '' CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors . `` As proud as I am that a billion people use Facebook each month , I 'm also really happy that over 600 million people now share and connect on Facebook every month using mobile devices . '' He added that 126 million users accessed Facebook only through a mobile device in September and that the mobile trend can mean only dollar-signs for the social network . `` First , mobile will give us the opportunity to reach way more people than desktop , '' he explained . `` Second , people on mobile use Facebook more often . And , third , long term , I think we 're going to monetise better per amount of time spent on mobile than desktop . '' So what does this mean for the average Facebook user ? Probably more adverts on the move ; Zuck sees mobile ads becoming more `` like TV '' in that they 're integrated into the app itself rather than simply displayed alongside . You can already see the beginnings of this in the undismissable sponsored posts popping up in your mobile newsfeed . Facebook 's shares rose 19 per cent on the strength of the announcements , the site 's highest ever rise since it went public back in May . The financial filing also revealed the final amount that Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram for : a total of $ 715 million ( around £443m/ AU $ 688m ) . It 's a lot lower than filter-happy photography app 's reported price tag of $ 1 billion because a certain percentage of the payment was made in shares , which lost value as Facebook struggled on the stock market . Still , what do you expect from a company that prides itself on being like a chair ?

Joanna Shields , the head of Facebook 's operations in Europe , is leaving the social network to join London 's Tech City initiative . Shields , one of Mark Zuckerberg 's most trusted lieutenants and one of the most powerful women in tech history , will begin her new role in January . She will become the new chief executive of the government-sponsored Tech City Investment Organisation and will lead London 's bid to become the next global centre of tech innovation . The capture of Shields , who also held a senior position with AOL before joining the social network and becoming vice-president of Facebook , Europe , Middle-East and Africa , will be seen as a major coup by the TCIO . The former president of Bebo explained her decision to the Sunday Telegraph . She said : `` I really feel good about all the businesses I have been involved with . I was ready for a change and I felt that public service might be that change . `` Sometimes it 's important for the senior person to get out of the way and let others fly . I have four regional leaders [ at Facebook ] who are all really strong . It is their chance now . '' In her new role , Shields will 'have the ear ' of the government and will be able to take issues straight to Whitehall . She said London 's uniqueness as a centre for government , finance and the creative industries means it is ideally placed to become the next Silicon Valley `` London has access to government through Westminster , you have the creative industries [ and ] you have the financial sector , '' said Shields . `` You almost have Washington with government , New York with financial and advertising and creative and Los Angeles with creative all in one city and within a few square miles . `` This is the gateway to the world . It should not be a stepchild to other cities . It should be in its rightful place as the centre for innovation , the digital industries . The time has come . '' The TCIO was set up by the government to assist the development of tech start-ups in the region and help them to break through the glass ceiling . Shields explained the role : `` You need an investment organisation on behalf of those companies . '' `` When companies get to that next stage of funding we need to ensure they have the infrastructure available , that they have all the things they need to make sure that happens . '' For the full , wide-ranging interview with the new First Lady of Tech City , check out the hat-tip to the Sunday Telegraph in the link below . Via Sunday Telegraph
900 million users ca n't be wrong about anything , right ? MySpace had 100 million users in its prime , but today has only about 25 million users , most of them bands that do n't realise they should create a Tumblr page or start tweeting instead . But Facebook has a death grip on our social sub-conscious and seems wholly unstoppable . It 's hard it imagine going even one day without checking your feed for those new baby photos from Aunt Mary or commenting on some rabid political discourse . Yet , as we have learned recently when Mexico bested Brazil for Olympic gold , even the mightiest among us can fall prey to a determined underdog . And what could kill Facebook ? From a tiny startup capturing the mindhive to the smartphone in your pocket , several new trends could spell Facebook doom . This one has Facebook worried , and for good reason . On the small screen , banner ads are almost microscopic , so advertisers are concerned about whether anyone will notice them . And even when we do , we tend to click away from the ads or choose services that are less commercialised . Those under 18 have started clicking away from Facebook for engaging competitors . This trend has more to do with attention span than anything . Sites such as Tumblr and Pinterest are growing because we have so little time to waste online – we want to scan quickly and find interesting content . And , sometimes a new site with a fresh design takes root and grows while the legacy sites fade . Facebook does not have a stellar track record on privacy . For the most part , those 900 million users have given the service a free pass . But new identity theft challenges are cropping up . One new technique can scan for your credit card number online and start posting the number on Twitter . One day , millions of users might suddenly decide they do n't trust Facebook any more , especially with those baby pictures . Anyone who follows technology knows that storage costs are coming down . It 's getting cheaper to produce mass storage systems . Even Dropbox has been handing out more storage to users for free lately ( It added 8GB to our account for no apparent reason ) . Yet , as the user count rises , so does the need for more advertising to pay for that increase in capacity . We also know video will only increase in resolution , more users will post photos , and Big Data storage issues will only get worse . We now know Facebook is not worth quite as much as some thought . That could be problematic over the long run , as more investors start critiquing the business plans , condemning Facebook for privacy violations , and users switch en masse to mobile devices , pulling the plug on financing . He 's widely considered a boy genius , but the hoodie-wearing CEO could follow the path of Jerry Yang from Yahoo ! and countless other founders . In tech circles , a bright idea can lead to quick growth , but scaling a popular service into a large enterprise can take a different kind of vision , one that hinges more on financial accountability , management savviness and the ability to scale data for growth . We all know what Facebook is now . There 's a steady stream of personal updates , photos , and the occasional video . No other service can quite match Facebook in terms of a popular forum for discussion , and it 's one of the best ways to find long-forgotten family members and co-workers . Yet , whether Facebook survives depends on a long-term vision . Will the teens of today want to keep posting status updates when they are 25 ? Probably not . If the site does not morph with the masses , it could die . Facebook is a one-size-fits-all social network . Meanwhile , Google Plus has become the place for more technically astute users . Yet we 're already seeing a splintering into factions : Instagram is for those with more of a visual mindset , and sites such as Reddit.com are packed with users who have strong opinions . In the future , social networks might pop up that cater only to photographers or sports nuts . A massive earthquake takes out one of Facebook 's data centers . A virus spreads through the network and works its havoc over several weeks , leaving no trace of its origin . A new `` feature '' leaks the data for every user to a foreign country . Who knows what catastrophe might befall a company with 900 million users ? And , more importantly , who knows if Facebook is prepared to deal with the problem . One last possible Facebook killer is user revolt . After years of agreeing to look at ads that match up with our personal ( but private ) interests , sharing data that we 'd normally keep more private , and serving as pawns in the grand scheme of things ( Facebook earns money from each specific user ) , we might finally just call it quits . Users might close up accounts for good and move on to the next big thing .

Facebook new and improved Gifts has rolled out to a small number of users so far , but that 's likely to change at the top of next month , when the social network site holds a Gift-focused event in New York City . Facebook 's press event is scheduled to take place on Nov. 1 in the home of high-end toys , FAO Schwarz . Yes , that 's the same Fifth Avenue retailer at which Tom Hanks danced to songs on a giant floor piano . While there 's no word as to whether or not Mark Zuckerberg will perform `` Heart & Soul '' and `` Chopsticks '' on the famous keyboard , the Facebook CEO should go into great detail about the new physical gift-giving program . Facebook Gifts is expected to get a big push ahead of the holidays , as it 's seen as a new way for the company to make money on mobile platforms ( we 've never written that sentence before ) . More than half of its traffic accesses the site from mobile 's hard-to-advertise-on screens . Partners like Starbucks , Happy Socks , The Honest Company and Cheryl 's Cookies by 1800 Flowers are also hoping to benefit from the new giving-and-receiving initiative and the now-one billion users who populate Facebook . With the advent of one new product comes with the demise of another : Facebook Questions for users . A Facebook representative confirmed to TechRadar that the company is retiring its user-based questions-and-answers feature to `` focus efforts elsewhere . '' `` Pages and Groups will still be able to ask Questions , '' noted the Facebook representative . `` People will also still have access to their old questions via timeline . '' This comes at a time when there are more than a dozen question and answer competitors out there . The most notable rival is Quora , which , interestingly , was started by two former Facebook employees , Adam D'Angelo and Charlie Cheever . Via AllThingsD , TechCrunch

Microsoft 's annual fall dashboard update for the Xbox 360 brought plenty of changes to consoles earlier this week . The slow rollout is still continuing around the globe , with all markets expected to have the latest dashboard by Oct. 23 . Though new tricks like Internet Explorer and better Kinect voice recognition joined the anticipated Xbox Music service as new features , it appears some older apps have been discontinued . With the latest update , Microsoft removed both the Facebook and Twitter apps from the Xbox Live store . It 's unclear right now why the Facebook and Twitter apps have been removed from the Xbox Live app marketplace . Despite the annual app updates on the Xbox 360 , the Facebook app itself has n't seen an overhaul since its launch . Neowin speculated the introduction of Internet Explorer may have had a part in the removal of the social networking services . Users who had previously downloaded either app will be able to continue to access both Facebook and Twitter through their Xbox 360s , which makes the removal that much more puzzling . Microsoft even still lists both Facebook and Twitter as partners on the `` Be Entertained '' portion of the Xbox Live web page . TechRadar has reached out to Microsoft , and will update this story if and when a request for comment is returned .

Users might notice new ads pop up on their smartphones ' Facebook News Feed as the social network has opened up its latest strategy to make money through its mobile app . In August , Facebook began testing a new `` mobile app install ads '' program that was n't connected to users ' social ties . The test was apparently a success as Facebook announced Wednesday via its developer blog that it 's opening the service up to all developers . The test program allows an undisclosed amount of third-party developers purchase ad space on the mobile News Feed to help drive buyers to their apps . Those advertisements then lead users to the developer 's app store purchase page either through the Android or Apple app store . `` For years , many apps and games on Facebook.com have used ads as an important part of their growth strategy , '' Facebook 's Vijaye Raji wrote on Facebook 's developer 's blog . `` Now we are bringing these opportunities to mobile apps , '' Raji continued . `` With these new ads , mobile apps and games of all sizes across any category can reach the right audience , at scale . '' In the post , Raji touted the new program 's ability to help developers reach more relevant audiences and drive up install rates . He pointed to game creator TinyCo , which saw a 50 percent higher click-through rate when it participated . Other advertisers reached 8-10 times the audience and Ad Parlor clients saw consistent 1-2 percent increases in click-through rate from the home feed , according to Facebook . This is a bit of a break from the Facebook ad norm . Traditionally , ads pop up on users ' pages because they or a friend liked the brand . But with this program , dev advertisers will be able to target the audience they want to sell to , instead of who likes them . Facebook is banking on the hope that those two groups will have a large cross-section . Since the ad program is new , Facebook will still need to work out a few kinks to smooth out the user experience . The company will also improve the program 's ad targeting abilities , as well as make sure developer ads are n't targeting users on the wrong platform . The program comes as Facebook tries to monetize its mobile space . The social network as a whole has felt the pressure to become more profitable after its failed IPO in May . In September , the stock hit a new low at $ 17.55 ( UK£11.14 , AU $ 17.33 ) from its starting price of $ 38 ( UK£23 , AU $ 36 ) . We 'll see if the new mobile app install ad program wows investors next Tuesday , when Facebook calls to share its third-quarter earnings .

Facebook is imitating what social-networking rival Pinterest does best and is launching a new feature called Collections and the long-promised `` Want '' button . At the same time , `` liking , '' `` wanting , '' and `` collecting '' businesses ' products through photo albums is a great counterweight to the site 's other recent gift-focused unveiling , Facebook Gifts . `` Collections can be discovered in News Feed , '' a Facebook spokesperson told TechRadar . `` People will be able to engage with these collections and share things they are interested in with their friends . People can click through and buy these items off of Facebook . '' Businesses that spread the word about their products through photo albums will benefit the most from Collections . So far , this new type of Page post is being tested with retailers Pottery Barn , Wayfair , Victoria 's Secret , Michael Kors , Neiman Marcus , Smith Optics , and Fab.com . Facebook does n't `` want '' anything in return from brands using Collections . At this time , there 's no referral fee when users are sent offsite through a link to purchase a product - but that could always be implemented in the future . Also a possibility for the future is an offsite social plugin . Facebook told TechRadar that `` this is not a social plugin and is not available offsite at this time . '' ( emphasis added ) . Facebook refers to Collections as a new way for businesses to communicate with customers . But the envious growth of Pinterest , especially with its 80 percent women userbase , has obviously been the major influence . Facebook is n't alone . Apple reportedly showed an interest in buying The Fancy , a Pinterest rival that describes itself as `` part store , blog , magazine and wishlist . '' Pinning its hopes on developing Collections internally , Facebook is rolling out the new feature in a big way : the ability to `` like , '' `` want , '' and `` collect '' is available to everyone right now .

Facebook is in the final stages of testing its native Android app and will release it super soon , according to reports . Apparently the app is still being trialled internally , but a tipster told Engadget that the testing is coming to a close so a launch must surely be imminent . Facebook founder and CEO , Mark Zuckerberg has already confirmed that the native Android app was in the works and admitted that the HTML5 app it currently offers was a bit of a mistake . The company is betting big on mobile after a rocky start to its life as a publicly traded company . However , there probably wo n't be a Facebook-branded smartphone making its way to the shop shelves any time soon given that Zuckerberg said that would be `` the wrong strategy '' for the company . Last week , Facebook celebrated its 1 billionth active user , something that prompted it to proclaim that `` Chairs are like Facebook '' , a marketing slogan we hope it is already regretting .
Social commerce – it 's a buzzword that many small business owners will have heard . Selling goods and services via the burgeoning social networks could be the next big commercial space for all businesses , no matter what their size . A new study from Deloitte estimates that the Facebook economy could be worth £12.7 billion at the moment with that figure set to rocket over the coming years . All businesses should have a presence on Facebook , but moving from a brand awareness exercise to selling your company 's goods or services is the next logical step . The National Retail Foundation in the US recently found that over half of Facebook users have clicked through to a retailers website , with nearly a quarter having made an actual purchase from within Facebook . F-commerce looks likely to be a retail space that all businesses will need to be a part of , as their customer bases will simply expect this in a world were integrated retailing becomes the norm . Nathalie Gaveau , founder and CEO of Shopcade says : `` The difference that we are starting to see now is that consumers are shaping the future of retail in ways never seen before . The adoption of social media now means that consumers are more recommendation hungry than ever before – and when you combine this with technical advancements and the modern need of instant gratification , there 's little doubt that social shopping will be a huge part of our futures . '' The most important consideration for any individual or brand considering selling on Facebook is to engage with customers - Eugene Kaznacheev , Product Manager Ecwid With Eugene Kaznacheev , product manager at shopping cart software company Ecwid also commenting : `` The most important consideration for any individual or brand considering selling on Facebook is to engage with customers . Facebook is a communication platform , and it is a huge turn-off for customers if a page is transformed into a list of links to products . Merchants should build a community around their items first and foremost , and then offer customers a convenient way to purchase them . '' There are a number of ways to add a commercial component to your business ' Facebook page . Since the introduction of the Timeline , the layout of Facebook pages has become much clearer , which lends itself to F-commerce as your business can more easily showcase the goods or services it has for sale . The current leading F-commerce applications include : All of these platforms offer either free or low cost start-ups that can give your business a chance to test F-commerce for itself . The key is to look closely at the features that each platforms offers and more importantly , at their limitations before making your choice . Apps are now available that either link your Facebook profile directly to your store , or they can pull products in from either eBay via Facebook 's ebay items or Etsy 's Theme Shop to create a standalone store on your Facebook page . With the rush to tap into the millions of potential customers using Facebook every day , bear these points in mind when developing F-commerce for your business : Julia Priddle , head of key account management EMEA , at ChannelAdvisor advises : `` The key to selling on Facebook is to engage and socialise with customers by offering promotions , giveaways , flash sales and even customer support , all of which are only available to your Facebook fans . It is also very important to keep your content as fresh as possible , just as you would with your website . The most successful retailers have been those who regularly update the products on their page and , more importantly , the discussion topics on their pages . New competitions are a great way of engaging fans . '' What is vital to understand is that Facebook is not the goose that laid the golden egg when it comes to the next wave of e-commerce . It is early days for this space , but savvy businesses should begin to experiment now . With a range of free apps now available to test how your business ' customers react to placing goods or services onto your Facebook pages , small businesses in particular can learn from these experiences and be ready to embrace F-commerce when it reaches critical mass in the very near future .

The CEO of MySpace says the soon-to-be-reborn social network will not be seeking to compete with Facebook and Twitter . The revamped service , which is currently in private Beta , will allow users to join with their Facebook and Twitter accounts rather than register with another social network . Tim Vanderhook told NBC news that the new service will continue to appeal to music fans in the way LinkedIn is aimed as business users , and will not attempt to go head-to-head with the existing behemoths . He said : `` No one wants to manage another social network . We think it is unique and distinct , it integrates with Facebook and Twitter to be able to pull over your social graph and pull over your identity of who you are . `` We think Facebook is the uber social network that is supposed to be there . We think we built a great social network for artists . Similar to how LinkedIn built one for business , we think there is a huge gap that we wanted to fulfill . There is no point to compete with Facebook and Twitter . '' Vanderhook also clarified the status of users who 're continuing to make use of the old MySpace site . Initially they will be segregated from newcomers to the service until the company decides what to do with the old website . Vanderhook added : `` There will be a separate section for our consumer base using the classic MySpace . We are going to leave it up for quite awhile . We will make a decision at a later date if we will ever take down the old property . '' The impending relaunch comes after Specific Media picked up the company from News Corp for a bargain basement $ 35m ( £21.5m ) back in June 2011 . Last month , the company released a preview video offering a taste of what we can expect from the new MySpace , which impressed most observers . Those eager to jump back on the MySpace bandwagon can now sign up for an invite , but there 'll be no `` Steve Jobs style '' hard launch according to the company . `` We know we are the underdog , '' said COO Chris Vanderhook , brother of Tim . `` For us it is a little too presumptuous to do a big huge , bang , Steve Jobs launch . That 's not our brand and its not right for MySpace . We want to be able to prove everything that we want to do . '' Via ABC News

Facebook reached one billion active users Thursday , a feat it celebrated by likening itself to a chair , among other inanimate objects , but the good news may be tainted by a recent revelation . According to reports , Facebook is scanning users ' private messages and automatically issuing Likes on their behalf . The Likes are reportedly done without user permission and are based on links to `` Likeable '' pages sent between users . One link accrues two Likes , Forbes reported . A video picked up by Hacker News ( and subsequently taken down by YouTube ) reportedly demonstrated the two-Like increase . Gizmodo also seemingly verified it by messaging a friend with a link to singer-songwriter and producer The-Dream 's official Facebook page . The-Dream 's Like count went up without a click of the Like button . TechRadar contacted Facebook for comment on these reports and received a response from a Facebook spokesperson explaining what they say is really going on . According to the spokesperson , Facebook social plugin Shares , not Likes , are affected and not actual Facebook pages . `` Absolutely no private information has been exposed , '' the spokesperson said via email . `` Each time a person Shares a URL to Facebook , including through messages , the number of Shares displayed on the social plugin for that website increases . `` Our systems parse the URL being shared in order to render the appropriate preview , and to also ensure that the message is not spam . `` These counts do not affect the privacy settings of content , and URLs shared through private messages are not attributed publicly with user profiles . '' Social plugins `` let you see what your friends have liked , commented on or shared on sites across the web '' and occur off Facebook , according to the site 's developers page . The spokesperson continued to say there is a bug that sometimes bumps up social plugin Shares and Likes by two , and the company is working to fix the error . `` We did recently find a bug with our social plugins where at times the count for the Share or Like goes up by two , and we are working on [ a ] fix to solve the issue now . '' The spokesperson reiterated the social plugin and Share side of the message scanning issue . `` To be clear , this only affects social plugins off of Facebook and is not related to Facebook page Likes . This bug does not impact the user experience with messages or what appears on their timelines . '' Shares are an anonymous activity , the spokesperson noted . As for the Gizmodo report and YouTube Video , the spokesperson pointed TechRadar to the `` Like Button '' section of its developer site , specifically to information titled `` What makes up the number shown on my Like button ? '' The site explained that `` the number shown is the sum of '' : With that information , it appears Facebook pages accrue Likes due to link sharing via private user messages , though TechRadar is still waiting for official confirmation . Message scanning is n't anything new , by the way : Gmail scans user emails to create targeted ads and Facebook also reportedly scans user messages to look for sexual predators and child pornography .
The more time I spend on Facebook , the more I 'm convinced that the whole thing is one big horrible social experiment , boiling a frog for the internet generation . `` Hahahah ! '' I imagine Mark Zuckerberg cackling . `` They 're still putting up with it ! Crank up the Crap-O-Meter ! '' Just when you thought there was n't room for any more crap in your news feed , Facebook 's come up with a belter : people will be able to pay to promote their posts . This is , of course , a bloody awful idea . The kind of people who will pay to promote their posts are exactly the kinds of people whose posts should n't be promoted . They 're the marketers , the oversharers and the egomaniacs - the very people for whom the `` hide everything this person posts forever '' option was created . As my esteemed colleague Kate Solomon rightly points out , promoted posts are `` the digital equivalent of LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME I 'M PULLING A FUNNY FACE WHY ARE N'T YOU LOOKING ? '' Such posts should be eliminated , not encouraged . The next step , of course , is bound to be a paid-for option that removes the promoted posts , Facebook selling the cure to a disease it created . Facebook has always walked a very thin line between usefulness and outright contempt for its users , but I think it 's veering significantly into the latter category . If the future is mobile , then Facebook 's own iPad app shows that the future is foul . I 'm not exaggerating . On the iPad , the Facebook experience is hopeless . You ca n't hide the oversharers and marketers ( you need to go back to the web version for that ) or even share your pals ' posts , and you get huge blocks of promoted links that fill most of the screen with ads for cars you ca n't afford , clothes you would n't wear and happy-clappy new age bollocks that you thought had been laughed out of town in 1968 . The ads are awful , but they work : speaking to USA Today , COO Sheryl Sandberg says that such ads are `` eight times more engaging '' than the ads you 've trained your eyes to ignore . The USA Today piece contains the dread phrase `` really focus on monetization '' , with particular reference to the mobile app : in other words , Facebook is going to start squeezing every penny it can out of its mobile apps by cranking up the Crap-O-Meter - and as long as everyone we know is on it , we 'll still put up with it . I 'm curious . What does Facebook have to do before you - we - dump it ?
Over a billion people are now using Facebook on a regular basis , with over 600 million of them using mobiles to do so . To celebrate , the company has released a little video that likens Facebook to , among other things , a chair , doorbells and basketball . Sure , Facebook . Sure you 're like a chair . Back to the hard stats , then . The now familiar 'like ' action has proven popular , with Facebook reporting 1.13 trillion Likes and counting , as well as 140.3 billion friends made on the site . Sharing photos has always been a major feature of Facebook , so it 's no surprise to hear that 219 billion of the things have been uploaded , while over 300 million more are added every day . Mark Zuckerberg , founder and CEO of the site , said it has been an 'honor ' to 'serve ' us Facebook users . The stat-splurge comes with a blocked Hollywood scriptwriter 's dream cache of user stories , including the one about a woman who was presumed dead tracking her family down on the social network 34 years after a car accident left her with amnesia . You 'll like this one if romance is more your genre of choice : a boy and a girl fell in love . Something went wrong and they broke up . Years passed : the boy married and had children , his children had children , and a man named Mark invented a website called Facebook . The boy joined Facebook and looked up his girlfriend of 42 years before . They exchanged messages , they met , they fell back in love and they got married . ... What ? Nothing , just something in our eye . Update : Here is the chair video . Enjoy :
Egomaniacs will love Facebook 's latest money-spinner , which gives users the option to pay to promote their own personal posts in friends ' news feeds . Testers in the US now have the option to pay $ 7 ( about AU $ 7 and £4 ) to promote their posts , with 5,000 accounts being given the option of pushing their updates to the top of friends ' newsfeeds . The tests began in New Zealand in May , with 19 other countries ( including Australia ) also getting the narcissistic option ahead of the US . Facebook thinks you might want to use the paid option to make sure your big posts stand out as news feeds get more crowded . The social network suggests that you might want to ensure all your friends are aware of your wedding photos , your engagements or your garage sales . But we think that making sure everyone knows what you had for lunch or that your baby just gurgled , or sees that photo of your rabbit with mittens on its ears would be $ 7 well spent . After all , if you 're going to use the digital equivalent of LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME I 'M PULLING A FUNNY FACE WHY ARE N'T YOU LOOKING ? , you might as well go the whole hog . Sadly , there 's no word on which countries are next in line for the update and Facebook tells us there 's no information on if or when UK users will be able to toot their own horns even more than usual . Twitter , meanwhile , has gone for the Facebook-esque option of offering paid-for Twitter surveys to brand accounts , which will appear as promoted tweets in the coming weeks .

After a September reveal , Facebook officially launched its new Photo Sync feature for iOS and Android devices on Friday . Though Photo Sync was tested by a select number of Android users for the past few months , and iOS for the past week or so , Facebook finally opened up the feature to the rest of its mobile users . When enabled , Photo Sync will upload any and all pictures taken on a mobile device to a private , locked folder called `` Synced from Phone '' within Facebook . Once there , users can decide which pictures to share with the rest of their friends , and which pictures should remain private . For any iPhone and iPad users , Photo Sync will only work when the device is upgraded to iOS 6 . Photo Sync appears to work with any version of Android , as Facebook does n't specify any requirements to use the feature on that particular OS . Once a user agrees to allow photos to sync from a smartphone , the Facebook app immediately begins uploading the images ( up to 2GB ) to the website . How often the device uploads images is entirely up to the user , though new photos taken will by synced as they are taken . Users can also choose how to sync the photos ( via WiFi , cellular network , or both ) , and can turn off the feature entirely and delete photos from the private folder at their discretion . For those concerned about data plan overages , Facebook assures smaller versions of the photos ( 100K ) will be uploaded over 3G and 4G networks , while larger versions will be uploaded when connected to a wireless signal . A prompt to `` Get Started '' will appear at the top of the Facebook feed in the app when the feature has rolled out to your market .

Google 's Bradley Horowitz has chucked down the social networking gauntlet , saying that Facebook is `` pissing off users '' . He argues that the 'Book has had its day , calling it a `` social network of the past '' and that its intrusive ads are what is killing it . Using a slightly laboured analogy of two people chatting while a guy in a sandwich board keeps trying to get them to sell them a sandwich , he said , `` I 'm trying to communicate in that sacred space of social connection . `` It does n't matter if I 'Like ' the sandwich , it does n't matter if it 's personalised with my favourite mustard , that is the wrong moment to try and dangle [ it ] in front of me . `` There is a time and place for sandwiches , '' he added , to soothe sandwich fans ' potential ire . `` It 's called lunch at a restaurant . '' He added that Facebook 's ad strategy of `` jamming '' ads into people 's news streams is `` pissing off users and frustrating brands '' . Guess who 's doing it better ? That 's right , Google 's own social network , Google+ . Horowitz says that Google 's use of social recommendations rather than straight-up ads is a more `` holistic '' approach . That 's all well and good but are your friends actually using Google+ ? The company reckons 100 million people are actively using the network each month but whether they 're using it enough to make the recommendations engine work effectively is another story .

The Facebook privacy hoax messages that have circulated the social network are n't real , but the proposed changes that it plans to make to the site governance document are . These changes put Facebook at odds with privacy groups like Open Rights Group , which does n't want to see an end to the user voting policy or modifications to messaging controls . `` Although the voting system has been criticized as window dressing , '' Open Rights Group Director Jim Killock told TechRadar , `` it has at least acted as a break on unexpected changes . '' That window dressing may also be at odds with a November 2011 Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) deal in which Facebook agreed to introduce `` opt in '' privacy changes . Killock is hoping the U.K. 's Information Commissioner 's Office will be another agency that investigates Facebook over privacy changes . `` We will be writing to the Information Commissioner to ask them to examine the changes in privacy policy , and to coordinate their action with other data protection authorities , '' Killock said . Facebook outlined the new privacy changes on its site governance page and , as per its policy , if the posts receive 7,000 user comments , a site-wide vote will be triggered . Adding up all of the comments in various languages totals 85,920 and counting , a number that far exceeds the 7,000 user comments required . But the measure is n't guaranteed to pass the site-wide vote . The vote is only binding if 30 percent of Facebook 's 1 billion users cast a ballot . Whether or not the Facebook privacy changes are a hot enough topic for 300 million users to vote , the changes are trending for Killock . `` The sharing of data across Instagram and Facebook is a change that not everyone will want , '' he said of the proposed shared-data change . `` However helpful it is to Facebook , users should have the right to choose how their data is used . They may not want more finely targeted ads , not for Facebook to be able to infer things about them . '' When asked how users can do more to protect their privacy rights on social networking sites , Killock said `` you should be asking your governments for fuller rights , especially to retrieve and remove your data from companies whenever you like . `` You should have the right to control your relationships with data businesses . '' About the debunked Facebook privacy hoax that sparked a chain of bold , but fruitless ownership statements from users , Killock said the it `` showed how worried people are . '' `` They clearly have a good idea about how vulnerable they are to arbitrary changes in policies from sites like Facebook . '' Via BBC News

Facebook and Apple have teamed up to offer digital iTunes vouchers through the social network 's Gifts feature . Facebook Gifts , which is being trialled in the U.S. , allows people to buy presents for their pals on occasions like birthdays and engagements , or for whenever they 're feeling particularly generous . Users can click the gift icon on a friend 's Timeline , or underneath the birthday announcements in their news feed , to get started , before picking out a gift from a host of options . On its official newsroom blog , Facebook said the iTunes gift cards are ideal for friends wishing to share movie and music recommendations as it would give the recipient a way to act upon the tip . The post read : `` Starting today with Facebook Gifts , you can instantly gift your friends iTunes digital gifts and recommend albums , movies , games , apps , and more available on the iTunes Store . '' Facebook users can purchase iTunes vouchers worth up to $ 50 ( UK£31 , AUD $ 47 ) and friends can redeem the voucher code through an iTunes account as soon as they receive a notification . The link comes as ties between Apple and Facebook slowly become closer . The pair had endured a frosty relationship in recent years , but patched things up when Apple launched iOS 6 with deep Facebook integration . The social network has vowed to launch the Gifts initiative in countries outside the U.S . `` soon . ''

Facebook has outlined a new set of user policy guidelines , the highlight of which is a plan to prevent users vetoing future proposed changes . In the `` proposed changes to our governing documents '' emailed to all users on Wednesday , Facebook said it had decided to remove the option for users to comment on planned policy changes . In the past , the now-publicly-traded company had operated a system whereby if a proposed policy alteration received 7,000 user comments , a site-wide vote on its legitimacy would be triggered . However , Facebook said the voting system was failing as a means of gaining quality user feedback and assured users they need n't worry because the government had been watching it since the stock floatation . On the company blog Elliot Schrage , Vice President , Communications , Public Policy and Marketing , wrote : 'We are proposing to restructure our site governance process . `` We deeply value the feedback we receive from you during our comment period . In the past , your substantive feedback has led to changes to the proposals we made . `` However , we found that the voting mechanism , which is triggered by a specific number of comments , actually resulted in a system that incentivised the quantity of comments over their quality . `` Therefore , we 're proposing to end the voting component of the process in favor of a system that leads to more meaningful feedback and engagement . '' Other policy changes suggested in Wednesday 's posting will prevent users from blocking messages from other people on Facebook , in favour of a new filtering system . Beyond that , the company now plans to share your data with other companies that it owns ( i.e . Instagram ) and will give users more opportunity to customise the information in their Timeline that is visible to others . Take a look - perhaps for the last time - at the proposed policy changes . Users have until 9PM EST on Wednesday November 28 to attempt to shoot them down .

Orange has signed a deal with Facebook to offer users a 'social calling ' service that allows you to call friends from within the social network . You 'll be able to do this through Facebook in the web browser as well as through its mobile apps , with the whole thing working quite a lot like Skype . It means that you wo n't need to know all your contacts ' phone numbers before you can speak to them , and you 'll also be able to hold 'group calls ' for when one friend at a time just is n't enough . The service will be free if you 're calling mates who also use the service , so the likes of Skype and BlackBerry 's new BBM Voice offerings may need to watch out . Unfortunately , the calling element is n't quite ready to go – it 's set to launch in summer 2013 , with France first to get the Skype-alike service . Orange is powering the whole shebang using the same tech found in Libon , its new internet-calling and messaging app currently on iOS ( an Android version is launching next year ) . That app works in 95 countries around the world , which bodes well for Facebook-calling expansion . TechCrunch also cites anonymous sources who claim that this is just the next step of Facebook 's thrust into phone-based-offerings after it introduced video calling last year . Some have hinted that the long-rumoured , much-disputed Facebook phone is still on the cards with Orange on board for that project – but that 's all pie in the sky for now .
Facebook has begun testing its new automatic photo upload service on a small sample of iOS app users . The Photo Sync feature , which was tested on some Android app users in September , will upload all photos taken with the device 's camera to the social network as soon as the picture is taken . While that may be a terrifying prospect for those snapping more than just beautiful landscapes , cats and cheesecake , Photo Sync will not post photos directly to the user 's Timeline without approval . Instead all photos will be stored in a private folder within the Facebook user 's photo albums , where the decision can be made on whether to make them public or share with pals via direct message . The idea is to simplify the process of uploading photos to the social network and takes its lead from the Google+ Instant Upload feature . `` Only you can see the photos you 've synced from your phone . Your photos are saved privately in a section of your Facebook Photos that only you can see . When you view your synced photos , you can choose shots to share or send in a private message , '' said a post on the Facebook help pages . Photo Sync works over both Wi-Fi and mobile internet , but the data-conscious user can also configure the service to sync only using Wi-Fi . To check if you 're one of the few users currently able to test the feature , open the Facebook app , load the left-sided list menu , scroll down to Apps and select Photos . If you see 'Sync ' at the bottom of the page , it can be enabled .

Mozilla has released the latest Firefox update , version 17 by its count , which adds a new social API . The social API allows for a persistent social sidebar that gives users direct access to chatting with their social networks while surfing the web . As a partnership between Mozilla and Facebook , the first social feature for Firefox 17.0 is Facebook Messenger . Turning the Facebook Messenger feature on opens up the Facebook chat sidebar on the right side of the browser along with notifications at the top for incoming comments , photo tags , and other notifications . While Facebook Messenger is the only social sidebar out for Firefox 17 right now , the social API will make it possible for other social networks to build their own similarly integrated tools . Also new in Firefox 17 is the click-to-play blocklisting feature for plug-ins . With the feature , Firefox will no longer automatically run web content that uses an out-of-date plug-in , such as if the computer 's version of Flash needs to be updated . Users can still manually click on content to run using older plug-ins , or allow Firefox to try and install a newer version of the plug-in . The other big change in the new version of Firefox is that Mozilla has finally cut off support for Mac OS X 10.5 . Safari dropped Leopard support last year , and Chrome followed suit a few weeks ago , making Opera the only major browser to still support the legacy Apple OS . Mozilla also recently overhauled Firefox for Android , making its mobile browser compatible with nearly 250 million more Android smartphones on the market . Mozilla is banking on social features to make Firefox fit more easily into its users ' lives . Facebook Messenger is a good start , while Twitter and Reddit sidebars ca n't be too far behind .

Facebook moves fast : one day after the news broke the social networking site said it was introducing a share button on its mobile site , the company revealed the feature is now available on its iOS and Android apps as well . `` Today , Facebook announced that you can now use the Share button on iOS , Android and the Facebook mobile website to share news feed stories , '' the company told TechRadar in an email . `` This gives people a fast way to share stories with friends from their mobile devices , just as they can from their computers . '' The share button works through the Facebook for Android app , Facebook for iPhone and iPad app and Facebook mobile website . Facebook also posted the announcement in its Newsroom , explaining how the feature works ( not that most Facebookers are n't familiar with sharing ) . `` When you click share on a news feed story in your Facebook app or on m-site , you can re-post the story on your own Timeline so your friends can see it , '' the announcement outlined . Something like this has been missing from Facebook 's mobile presence for an oddly long time , so it 's not too surprising the social network wanted to push this out as soon as possible .

Facebook is in the process of rolling out a share button for its mobile site , a spokesperson for the company told TechRadar Wednesday , and has plans to expand . `` We started rolling out a share button on the mobile site , and it will be coming to iOS and Android , '' the spokesperson said . No other details , like a specific time frame for the OS inclusion , were offered except the promise that the social network would get back in touch `` when we have more information . '' Such a button has been missing from the site 's mobile interface despite requests from users to add a clickable feature that would allow them to repost things like photos , links and statuses . Inside Facebook first spotted the arrival of the mobile share button , though initially reported it as a test . Now , with Facebook 's confirmation , it looks as though the feature is here to stay . The development marks just one of several new features the site introduced Wednesday . First up was a Social Jobs Partnership app , which lets job seekers hunt for work through the site based on location , industry or skill , with all openings backed up by a handful of employment search services . Also on Facebook 's agenda was the introduction of Pages Feeds , or news feeds free of friends ( sorry , guys ) and featuring posts from the pages users like . TechRadar will provide any and all information related to the new share button as soon as it becomes available .
Add job hunting to the list of things Facebook can do for you . The social network announced a new application for its Social Jobs Partnership ( SJP ) program Wednesday . `` When it comes to economic growth , few issues are more important than matching qualified candidates with great jobs , '' said a Facebook post heralding the app . `` In that spirit , we know that the power of social media – the connections between friends , family and community – can have an outsized impact on finding jobs . '' The SJP app lets users search for jobs based on location , industry or skill . It 's backed by employment search services BranchOut , DirectEmployers Association , Jobvite , Work4Labs and Monster.com , which all bring search results to Facebook . SJP then organizes results based on which job board provides leads . Job hunters will then have to follow the links back to the respective job search service or Facebook app . The application is part of a larger jobs effort launched by Facebook last year with its Social Jobs Partnership page . It 's a program that `` leverages social media to connect great jobs with great candidates . '' Facebook partnered with the U.S. Department of Labor , the National Association of Colleges and Employers and others to give advice and resources for finding work through the page . Facebook also tossed in a few job-finding statistics it gathered along with the announcement . According to the company , 50 percent of employers use Facebook in the hiring process now , and 54 percent of them anticipate `` Facebook becoming a more important part of the talent acquisition process in the near future . '' But the app is n't the only new page Facebook turned over . A Pages Feed feature is rolling out too . It 's a new filter that allows users to get pure page goodness in their news feeds . No more clutter from friends ' cute cat photos , just joke headlines from The Onion and updates from Car Talk and Taylor Swift . The Pages Feed wo n't affect the way the News Feed works , it 's just a new filter . Users can access the feed from their home page under the Pages section . Just click the Pages Feed button and voila , feast on page news . Facebook said the new feature is hitting the network now . Users should notice the new filter soon , if it has n't already appeared . With the new apps , the unemployed can now feel a little less guilty about spending huge chunks of time on the social network . However , Facebook still remains the bane of productivity for those with jobs . Via TheNextWeb
Zynga saw a number of executive changes Tuesday , including the departure of its chief financial officer , David Wehner , to Facebook . Wehner is leaving Zynga to join the social network in a senior finance role , while Mark Vranesh , chief accounting officer , will take over as CFO in addition to maintaining his current position . Zynga appointed David Ko , formerly chief mobile officer , as the company 's new chief operations officer . Barry Cottle will take over as chief revenue officer , jettisoning his role as executive vice president , business and corporate development . Steven Chiang was appointed president of games , a bump up from his previous position as executive vice president of games . Vranesh has already served as Zynga 's CFO , filling in that role from May 2008 to August 2010 . After that time , he took over as chief accounting officer . Ko 's appointment as head of operations is particularly noteworthy as it signals the importance the gaming company is placing on mobile moving forward . He will oversee strategy planning , international , infrastructure and operations of the company . Coming from an executive mobile position , it 's not too hard to fathom in which direction Ko would like take Zynga . The dog-eared company has had to swallow some bitter financial pills recently , including a $ 95 million ( UK£60 , AUD $ 91 ) loss over the defunct acquisition of OMGPOP . It also drained $ 108 million ( UK£70 , AUD $ 103 ) in lost earnings earlier this year , the blame for which it rested on Facebook 's poor initial public offering . With Wehner leaving to help Facebook up its fortunes as Zynga struggles to find its own , how the companies mingle moving forward will make for some interesting observation .

Free instant messaging apps like iMessage and Facebook Messenger have caused the first ever decline in texts sent in the U.S. , according to new research . The report from mobile analyst Chetan Sharma claimed the average mobile user sent 678 texts a month during the last quarter . That represents a slight drop from 696 sent per user in the quarter before . Sharma attributes the fall , which has already been evidenced in other countries , to users relying on internet-based alternatives like Apple 's iMessage app and the Gtalk equivalent for Android devices . There 's also cross-platform solutions like Facebook Messenger , Twitter , Skype and What 's App , all of which make it exponentially easier for smartphone owners to chat for free without spending text allowances . `` Most western markets have seen the net revenue in the messaging segment decline . The U.S. market has resisted the decline thus far , '' wrote Sharma in his independent report . `` In Q3 2012 , for the first time , there was a decline in both the total number of messages as well as the total messaging revenue in the market . '' The slight fall in text message revenue would be bad news for mobile operators had they not already shifted the weighting of price plans in order to account for the massive growth of mobile data use . Via New York Times , Chetan Sharma
Yet more tinkering is taking place over at Facebook HQ where the social network 's dev elves are trying out threaded commenting on Facebook pages . You wo n't see the tests on any personal Facebook profiles , only a selection of brand pages will have the option to in-line reply to specific comments - just as you can on Reddit , for example . As well as the threaded comments , Facebook 's trying out a new way of ranking the comments under each status , so that the 'most engaging ' ones show higher up ( i.e . the ones with the highest number of comments ) show higher up the thread . Because it 's all just a test , Facebook has n't said exactly which pages will see the new commenting system , nor whether it will roll out to all Pages in the coming weeks . Although you can currently tag a person in a comment by typing their name prefaced by the @ symbol ( a la Twitter ) , until the new changes roll out there 's no handy way to start and keep a conversation going in the comments under a status . Like many Facebook updates , we ca n't understand why this did n't come in earlier ; that 's a feeling that does not apply to promoted posts for users though , as you may be able to tell .

Facebook has announced a big overhaul to its Friendship Pages , including dedicated couples pages . If users are listed as 'In A Relationship ' with someone , browsing to Facebook/us will now redirect them to a neat new timeline-infused page chronicling the relationship with their significant other . The automatically-curated pages include a cover photo , joint profile pictures , the relationship status ( e.g . married since 2007 ) mutual friends , mutual likes and events the couple has shared . The updates , which will start rolling out to users immediately , will also work for your less intimate friendships . These will replace the old Friendship Pages and can be viewed by browsing to a pal 's profile page and hitting See Friendship from the drop-down settings menu . The newly-revamped pages will also feature a 'Share Friendship ' button to allow you to push your lovey-dovey relationship history onto unsuspecting mutual friends .

Facebook 's iOS app has been updated to version 5.1 , and while it does n't say it on the iTunes page , photo filters is among the new features . This comes just days after a report in The New York Times said Twitter was readying photo filters for its own mobile apps , to compete with the Facebook-owned Instagram . The Facebook Camera app launched in May . It lets you add filters to your snaps , but now Facebook has embedded the function into its main app , effectively rendering its Camera one obsolete . Filters like Contrast , Copper , Cream , and Black and White can be added by tapping the magic wand below the photo . Some might say Facebook launched the feature ahead of Twitter to make the micro-blogging service seem behind the times . But if that 's the case , why would n't it make more of a big deal of it ? By , for example , including it in the list of new features on the iTunes page ? Facebook has also added the ability to upload multiple photos from within the main app . So you can share a folder of snaps at once , without having to upload each individually . You can now buy Facebook Gifts through the iOS app , too . Previously , iOS users could only unwrap Gifts they 'd received , while Android and web users could send them to others . So now iOS users have no excuse . Via TechCrunch

The news spread across our Facebook network like wildfire : a man had tried to abduct a child in broad daylight outside the local primary school . The original post was shared and shared , and shared again until almost every parent in the area knew about it . It was n't true . On the third night of the London riots , Twitter was aflame with stories of dozens of hooded teenagers heading towards Holloway , bent on destruction , while other rioters freed animals from London Zoo . A photo showed the London Eye on fire . The stories were n't true . The photo was fake . In January , panicked reports spread on Twitter that a lone gunman was running amok in London 's Oxford Street , that people should stay indoors and that armed police were on the scene . That was n't true either . Facebook , Twitter and other social networks are superb places to discover breaking news , but all too often the stories people spread are exaggerated , mis-informed or even completely invented . How can you tell which is which ? Read on to discover how to play detective , and how to separate world-changing stories from falsehoods and fraud . Online misinformation tends to come in three different flavours : innocent cock-ups , distortions and outright falsehoods . The first category is quite common : all it takes is for somebody to mistranslate a foreign news item , to press the wrong button on a content management system , or to enter the wrong code in a form field and an incorrect story is posted , a pre-written obituary goes live by accident , or a product page is published with completely inaccurate information . Someone spots it , and within minutes it 's all over social networks like a rash . A particularly good example of a cock-up is the assassination in Beijing of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un , which was reported by several sites in February . The story was posted to Twitter by @ BBCLiveNews , and news and gossip site Gawker put the story on its front page . However , Jong-Un had n't been to Beijing and was n't dead . The BBC Twitter account was a fake one ( the real one is @ BBCNews ) , and Gawker was simply reposting rumours that had spread on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter , Weibo , about what turned out to be a commemoration of the life of Jong-Un 's late father . As Gawker put it in a follow-up post : `` The ruckus yesterday that prompted rumours of his demise was probably just a killer birthday party for his dad . '' Distortions are harder to spot , because there 's a grain of truth to them . For example , last year there were online calls for Jeremy Clarkson to be sacked when he apparently told BBC 's The One Show that striking public sector workers should be shot . Footage and transcripts of his comments quickly circulated online , proving that he did indeed say that , but whether by accident or design , the footage was edited in such a way that Clarkson 's comments were taken out of context , making them seem much more inflammatory than they actually were . Jeremy Clarkson wind-ups are n't particularly important , but other distortions are more serious . Many dubious and potentially dangerous health-related scams and scares distort genuine scientific research to sell snake oil , or make people panic about things they should n't , and the results can be serious : for example , online anti-vaccine scares mean that many parents are n't getting their children vaccinated against extremely dangerous diseases - diseases that could affect not just those children , but the people they come into contact with , too . Last but not least , we have outright fibs . In August , news outlets including the BBC , CNN , Forbes and the Daily Mail all reported that Internet Explorer users were significantly thicker than users of other browsers . That may well be true , but the study upon which they based their reports was bogus . It , and the company it supposedly came from , were invented by hoaxers who 'd found IE `` really hard to work with '' and decided to have a laugh at Microsoft 's expense . They created a fake website , grabbed images from a French research company 's site and sent out some emails . The same tactics , of course , are used by phishing sites to try to get your bank details . In much the same way that people fall for phishing scams because the sites look believable , we fall for and share fibs because they sound plausible . One of the most common kinds of falsehood is the fake celebrity death , when news of a famous person 's demise spreads across social networks . Unfortunately - but fortunately for the people concerned - not everybody who 's reported dead actually is . The most recent example occurred in May , when reports spread online that the Nobel prize-winning writer Gabriel García Márquez had died . He had n't , and the account that broke the 'news ' of his death proved to be a fake one set up in the name of fellow author Umberto Eco . Similar stories have circulated about Kanye West , Morgan Freeman , Jeff Goldblum , Charlie Sheen , Jon Bon Jovi , the Pope and Margaret Thatcher , but the most 'dead ' living person on social networks may well be Jackie Chan . At the time of writing there are more than 50 dedicated 'RIP Jackie Chan ' memorial pages on Facebook , even though the martial arts superstar is very much alive . Sometimes the stories are created for malicious reasons , such as a hatred of the person concerned , but in many cases the motivation is mere pranksterism , and the story is created for no other reason than to see how many people it can hoodwink . Such hoaxes are among the easiest to verify ; mainstream news sites and their related social media accounts are quick to check such claims and publish them if they 're true , so it 's a good idea to see if the news has reached @ Reuters , @ BBCNews or @ SkyNews before you retweet . Hoaxes are n't limited to celebrity deaths . They tend to turn up during major events like natural disasters , too . When L'Aquila in Italy was hit by an earthquake in 2009 , the respected Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera ran a photo of the devastation on its front page . The photo , unfortunately , was n't of the Italian earthquake , but of an earthquake that happened in China a year before . The hoaxer had simply lifted the image from Flickr and sent it in . Markham Nolan is the managing editor of Storyful , which uses social media to discover , verify and illuminate stories for some of the world 's best-known media outlets . A big part of that means spotting fakes and wrongly credited media files . `` We 've seen pictures emerge quickly from incidents like the Zanzibar ferry disaster and the recent Houla massacre that we 've been able to quickly debunk to save our clients from embarrassing themselves , '' Nolan explained , `` but often people will try to pass off video of similar events as current news events . The recent earthquake and tsunami threat off Indonesia saw several people pointing to videos of the 2004 Aceh tsunami , re-titled to claim that they were from Thai beaches in 2012 . '' Why would people do that ? `` It 's hard to say , '' Nolan says . `` Some of it is spam , with uploaders/scrapers of video trying to bait people to click links in the video description . Some of it tends to be pure attention-seeking for no discernible purpose , and some of it is pure naivety - people seeing a video , making a flawed leap in logic and thinking they 're contributing to the spread of news by re-uploading content that actively serves to make real news harder to find . '' Such content can spread rapidly . `` People underestimate the reach and influence of one video on YouTube , '' Nolan says . `` With an errant mention or tweet from one influencer , a video can rack up hundreds and thousands of hits in just a few hours . '' False content can be the bane of newspaper and website picture desks , but technology can help filter out the fakes . For example , if you think an image may not be what it purports to be , you can run it through TinEye . TinEye is a reverse image search : simply upload the image you 're suspicious about or paste in its URL , then hit 'Search ' , and the website compares it against a database of more than 2 billion images . If the image has circulated online , there 's a good chance TinEye will know about it . Not only that , but it can tell you whether the image has been modified and where it 's been used , so it 's as appropriate for checking supposed product photos on eBay as it is for debunking social media hoaxes . There 's a long tradition of photographic tomfoolery online , and images are frequently edited to show things that did n't actually happen . The famous photo of Harrods , where the building 's lights had been changed by a disgruntled employee to spell out an expletive , is a good example : the swearing was done in an image editor by satirical website The Poke . Images of this kind are a type of gullibility test . Is it really likely that an angry employee would be able to access the lights , change them to spell out anything at all , and have them on long enough not only to be noticed , but for someone to turn up with a good camera to get a shot of it ? And even if all of those things did happen , would n't you have heard about it on the news rather than via Twitter the following day ? The rumours about London rioters releasing dangerous animals from London Zoo were partly fuelled by a fake photo too . Images that supposedly showed an escaped tiger in Primrose Hill were indeed of a tiger , but one that had escaped from an Italian circus four years previously . Another image , apparently showing the army preparing its tanks in Bank , was a photo from the Arab Spring uprising in Egypt . Not all hoaxes are so easy to debunk , however . Images can be cloned to make small crowds look like big ones - a trick that dictators are particularly fond of - or cropped to remove important details . They can be airbrushed to change people 's appearance , to add in items from other photographs , to add physical impossibilities , or to remove people altogether . It can sometimes be exceptionally difficult to spot the alterations , but look for giveaways such as inconsistent lighting or skin tones , repeating elements ( a sure sign that a clone brush has been used ) , shadows going in the wrong direction , missing reflections or enormous great white sharks attacking helicopters . More sensibly , you can also check the image 's EXIF data , which can tell you when an image was created , what type of camera it was shot on and whether it 's been fiddled with . The quickest way to do that is to run the URL through an online EXIF data checker such as Jeffrey 's EXIF Viewer . There 's more . The BBC 's User Generated Content Hub carries out very detailed checks on images and video : ensuring that the language matches the location , checking images against maps , examining weather reports for the supposed location and date , checking that car registration plates match the country they 're supposed to be in , and in one case getting an eyewitness to point their camera out of the window to prove that they were where they claimed to be . That 's overkill for something like a funny image of Rihanna , of course , but the BBC 's UGC hub deals with images from flashpoints around the world , and falling for a hoax could inflame tensions and perhaps even cost lives .

Facebook is in the midst of a small test that hooks people up to Wi-Fi hotspots for free when they check into a business through the site . The social media giant is providing Facebook routers to local businesses in exchange for customer internet access . All customers have to do is check-in at the business to access the web . Developer Tom Waddington first discovered the project on Thursday . He picked up a piece of code called `` social_wifi '' in code used to build graphs and charts in Page insights . The explanation for the `` social_wifi '' entry read : `` People who liked your Page after checking via Facebook Wi-Fi , '' leading Waddington to speculate a `` Like-gated Wi-Fi product '' was in the works . The Cut Out + Keep co-founder was on the mark , as later someone at Facebook provided InsideFacebook with this explanation : `` We are currently running a small test with a few local businesses of a Wi-Fi router that is designed to offer a quick and easy way to access free Wi-Fi after checking in on Facebook . `` When you access Facebook Wi-Fi by checking in , you are directed to your local business ' Facebook Page . '' Furthermore , some stores may even offer deals or specials when customers and soon-to-be-Wi-Fi users check-in , though that 's nothing new for Facebook .
The HTC Opera UL will be the first official Facebook smartphone , so says a `` very reliable source '' . According to Pocket-Lint , an unnamed insider spilled the beans on social network 's first handset , claiming that it was indeed in development and that we 'd already got the first glimpse of it in a benchmark test . It 's claimed the HTC Opera GL is the name for the handset which is being developed specifically for Facebook , although little else is known about it at this time . The benchmark result which the informant refers to reveals the Opera UL sports a 1.4GHz processor , 720x1280 HD display and comes running Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean . The source did reveal the Opera UL has been subject to delays , it 's not clear what the reason is behind this , or indeed how long the handset has been pushed back . There have been many , many rumours about a potential Facebook phone , none of which have come to fruition , so we 're taking this latest news with a heavy dosage of salt .

Facebook was forced to temporarily disable its Midnight Message service today , after an IT student uncovered a security flaw . The Midnight Delivery app , which is part of the Facebook Stories site , allows users to send a message to their pals across the globe and have it appear when the clock strikes 12am on January 1 . However , when testing the messaging app , British IT student Jack Jenkins found that he was able to access messages and photos sent by other users , simply by modifying the URL of his own messages . The new messages displayed his personal profile picture , but the content of the messages , photos from other users , as well as the names of the recipients . Writing on his personal blog , Jenkins said he was able to view an image of a father and son ( people that he did not know ) and even delete messages that had been sent . Jenkins , who studies at Aberystwyth University , posted : `` It should n't be possible to do this , as these are not generic and are people 's personal images . `` A very bad part of it all is I think that you can actually delete other people 's messages , which I have tested for myself on a single message as I thought that it would say access denied . '' The flaw did not expose regular Facebook Inbox messages , only those which had been sent through the Midnight Delivery app , but this is still a pretty serious lapse . The social network said it was `` working on a fix , '' but in the meantime disabled the app to ensure more messages could not be exposed . It was available for use again as of noon in the UK ( 7am EST ) on New Year 's Eve . Via The Next Web

A Facebook security vulnerability , which could have been exploited to activate a user 's webcam and record them without their knowledge , was closed off this summer , it has been revealed . Facebook paid Indian research firm XY Security a $ 2,500 ( UK£1,546 , AUD $ 2,409 ) `` bounty '' in July for discovering the issue and drawing the bug to its attention , the social network has confirmed . The flaw , which Facebook said had never exploited by a potential 'Peeping Tom ' , could , conceivably have troubled users who had already agreed to give Facebook permission to access the camera . Beyond that the user would have to be 'tricked ' into visiting a malicious page , then agree to activate the camera - allowing the spy/pervert to begin recording . Facebook must have felt the threat was serious at it paid five times its usual rate to the two researchers who reported the flaw . `` This vulnerability , like many others we provide a bounty for , was only theoretical , and we have seen no evidence that it has been exploited in the wild , '' Facebook spokesperson Josh Wolens told Bloomberg . `` Essentially , several things would need to go wrong - a user would need to be tricked into visiting a malicious page and clicking to activate their camera , and then after some time period , tricked into clicking again to stop/publish the video . '' Facebook is one of many Silicon Valley heavyweights ( other notables being Google and Mozilla ) who offer 'bug bounties ' , paying out millions to researchers who spot flaws and potential dangers .

Those folks ( not us , honestly ) sending risque videos through the Facebook Poke and Snapchat apps can be comfortable in the knowledge that anything they send self destructs 10 seconds after it is viewed . Or can they ? Buzzfeed has uncovered a quite simple method for recipients of naughty messages to keep ahold of those potentially compromising clips to view and share with others as many times as they see fit . The key , according to the blog , is not to open the video once it is received . Because the file is stored locally , it can be easily accessed by plugging the iPhone into a computer and using file browsing software like iFunBox to examine the contents of the phone . At this point Snapchat users can locate the file by navigating to the Snapchat folder and finding the `` tmp '' file . Facebook Poke users can browser to library/caches/fbstore/mediacard to find the videos , and from there they can be copied to the desktop and kept . Both Poke and Snapchat alert the sender if the recipient attempts to take a screenshot of the picture or video before it disappears , but this method offers no such warning . Facebook now says it is working on a fix for the bug and told Buzzfeed : `` Thanks for reaching out , and we are addressing this issue now . We should have a fix pushed shortly . '' The company also encouraged Pokers to use the service responsibly and understand the risks . Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel brushed off the concerns and said people will always find way to 'reverse engineer ' technology , but those people are in the minority . He said : `` The people who most enjoy using Snapchat are those who embrace the spirit and intent of the service . There will always be ways to reverse engineer technology products - but that spoils the fun ! '' Via Buzzfeed

In one of the more ironic tech stories of 2012 Randi Zuckerberg , former Facebook director and sister of Mark , has been tripped up by the social network 's ever-changing privacy settings . The Silicon Valley heavyweight had posted a family Christmas photo to her Facebook page thinking it was only viewable to her friends . However , as her sister was also tagged in the photo and Randi had n't specified that the photo should be viewable only to her friends , it also appeared in the news feeds of those tagged . The photo , which simply depicts friends chatting around a kitchen table , was picked up by her sister 's pal , marketing director Callie Schweitzer , who assumed it was for public consumption and reposted it to Twitter . The tweet prompted an angry response from Randi Zuckerberg , who told Schweitzer that the repost was `` way uncool '' as `` I posted it to friends only on FB . '' In a further tweet , Ms Zuckerberg vilified the offending party a little more : `` Digital etiquette : always ask permission before posting a friend 's photo publicly . It 's not about privacy settings , it 's about human decency . '' Randi , who runs her own media company and produces a reality TV show about life in Silicon Valley , could have avoided the unauthorised share by customising the privacy settings during the upload process . If she had selected 'Custom ' from the picture upload settings menu , and then selected 'Friends , ' her sister 's pal would n't have seen it in her news feed . As many responders to her tweet have pointed out , perhaps this easy-to-make mistake is something she could take up with her brother , you know , the CEO of Facebook . Via Forbes

Facebook today launched its new Poke mobile messaging app for all of those who think social media would be better off without all of that pesky permanence . The Poke app lets users send short self-destructing messages , pictures , videos , and yes , even Facebook pokes to anyone and everyone on their friends list . Users can set messages with a timer of 1 , 3 , 5 , or 10 seconds , giving the recipient a short window of time to view it before it vanishes forever . Because of short viewing time the app also lets recipients take screenshots of the messages , which also notifies the sender that their message has been saved . If this all sounds familiar then there is a good chance you have already discovered Snapchat , a messaging app released back in June that offers nearly identical functionality . Snapchat has become the sexting app of choice due to its self-destructing messages leaving no trace behind , and now Facebook is making a bid for that audience . Messages sent with the Poke app can only be viewed through the app , without leaving a public marker on anyone 's timeline . Just in case the messaging gets out of hand , there is also a report and block feature built into the app . Even though Facebook recently updated its Messenger app to allow communication with non-Facebook users , the Poke app is locked down to only those with a Facebook account . Poke is only available on iOS for now , so iPhone users can already start sending secret messages to all of their Facebook friends .
Facebook 's new privacy tools have started to roll out . The social network touted them last week . They should make it easier to control who sees what you post , but you wo n't be able to remove your profile from searches . Facebook is dropping the feature because only a low percentage of users take advantage of it . Now , the only way to hide on the social network is to block each individual user from finding you . But new Privacy Shortcuts should make it easier to keep tabs on your profile . Options include : Who can see my stuff ? Who can contact me ? How do I stop someone from bothering me ? Before , you had to navigate multiple pages to adjust Timeline settings , so bringing it all together in one place should simplify things . App permissions have also changed . Facebook also outed a new feature that lets you drag and drop images straight into the social network . Which should make it even simpler to upload snaps . Though it could be dangerous this time of year , what with all the Christmas parties happening . Facebook itself is looking to enact new privacy policies , which will change how it shares your data . It also wants to stop letting you comment on planned policy changes . Via CNET

Facebook invited a limited group of users Thursday to test a new feature that lets members of the social network message folks they are n't connected to for a fee . The feature is being tested in the U.S. only at the moment , and for now the fee is set at a mere $ 1 to make sure your message is delivered to the recipient 's inbox rather than the Other folder . During this experimental phase , Facebook will try a variety of different prices in an effort to gauge what its users are willing to pay to have an important message delivered to someone in a situation where `` neither social nor algorithmic signals are sufficient . '' Currently , such algorithms are used to determine whether or not the users are actual friends of the person they 're messaging , or friends of friends . The feature can only be used once per week , and both the sender and the recipient must be active Facebook users ( brands and pages are excluded ) in the U.S . Facebook believes charging a minimal fee will help relevant and important messages get through , while keeping unwanted and inconsequential queries from filling up inboxes . Of course , what it also means for Facebook is a source of revenue , something the company has struggled to tie down . Just how much people are willing to spend to send a message we may never know if FB decides not to move forward with ubiquitous use , but it 's an interesting play for profits nonetheless . LinkedIn has a similar service with InMail , though that service is offered with premium accounts that users pay a monthly fee to run . In addition to testing out the new pay-to-send system , Facebook also implemented some new filtering upgrades to the existing Messenger for everyone to use . There are now two new filtering options available to allow users to better determine which messages make it through to their inbox or are automatically pushed to the Other folder . Basic filtering will let through messages from friends , as well as friends of friends , to the inbox without interruption . Strict filtering will only let messages from people users are actually connected to in the first degree to appear in the inbox . Both sets of filters now better manage messages sent from Messenger for Android , or from people with @ Facebook email addresses . More updates are expected to come to Facebook Messenger in the coming months , and we 'll keep a special eye out for that fee-based messaging system .

Got a big presentation coming up ? The best way to keep your audience engaged is to ditch the overpacked slides in favor of eye-catching visuals and slick animations . That means choosing free presentation software that can unlock your creativity and help you create a presentation that stands out . While Microsoft PowerPoint is a faithful standby for achieving great presentations , it doesn ’ t come cheaply . Unfortunately , the high cost makes it prohibitive for anyone on a tight budget . But , there are plenty of great alternatives available for free that you can use to design the perfect presentation . Choosing the best free presentation software can be time consuming if you don ’ t know what you ’ re looking for . To help , let ’ s take a look at five of the best free options available today . To make your presentation really shine , consider grabbing a free photo editor too , so your pictures look perfect before you add them to your slides . The best presentation software today is : Microsoft Office 365 For making professional-quality presentations , Microsoft PowerPoint is still the tool of choice . Unlike the tools below , it 's not free , but it 's packed with features you wo n't find elsewhere , such as notes that only the presenter can see , collaborative tools , image editing and lots more . Make stylish presentations online , for free Operating system : Windows , macOS , Linux ( in browser ) Prezi turns the traditional approach to presentations on its head . Instead of creating slide after slide , this presentation software gives you a single giant canvas . You can add blocks of text or images , or even create miniature slides . During your presentation , you can seamlessly fly around the canvas and zoom in to look at individual chunks of content . For how complex Prezi seems , it ’ s impressively simple to use the platform . The only major divergence from Microsoft Powerpoint is that you need to add animated paths from one part of the canvas to another . The tools for this are fairly straightforward , especially if you ’ ve ever used an animation or video editing software . Of course , this type of presentation structure isn ’ t always ideal . Prezi makes it hard to visualize structured data like financials , which can make it difficult to use in business applications . Some viewers also might not appreciate the fly-around animation style that ’ s inherent to the presentation software . Create stylish presentations and share them easily online Operating system : Windows , macOS , Linux ( in browser ) Canva is perfect for making speedy presentations right in your web browser . This software offers a handful of free layouts to help you get your slideshow started , and it ’ s easy to customize the templates to fit your needs . There isn ’ t a huge variety of content elements to add to your presentation , but Canva makes up for this with a searchable library of more than 1 million images you can use . Your Canva presentations live online , which makes it extremely easy to collaborate . You can invite colleagues to edit your slideshow ( although simultaneous editing is not supported ) or seamlessly share your finished presentation . However , beware that Canva can ’ t import presentations from Microsoft Powerpoint or export finished work to a Powerpoint-editable format . Read our full Canva review Free presentation software that 's a dead ringer for PowerPoint Operating system : Windows , macOS , Linux LibreOffice is a free alternative to Microsoft Office , and it includes a Powerpoint equivalent called Impress with nearly all of the same functionality . The only big difference you ’ ll find between the two slideshow creation tools is the LibreOffice lacks some modern features like built-in collaboration and integration with Microsoft OneDrive . However , Impress does have a few advantages of its own . The software can import files from Keynote , the default presentation software on Mac computers . Plus , there are hundreds of free templates that you can download for free . Even better , there ’ s no limit on what fonts you can use with Impress , so it ’ s easy to change the look of your presentation from what Powerpoint typically allows . On the whole , LibreOffice Impress is about as close as it gets to simply replicating Microsoft Powerpoint for free . Read our full LibreOffice review Free presentation software for all Google account holders Operating system : Windows , macOS , Linux ( in browser ) Google Slides is part of Google ’ s G Suite , and it does a nice job of matching Powerpoint ’ s capabilities . This free presentation software supports embedding videos , creating diagrams , and adding animations to your slides . While the selection of templates is somewhat limited , you can easily import hundreds of additional templates for free or create your own . Even better , Google Slides supports the collaboration tools users have come to expect from Google . Multiple people can work on a slideshow simultaneously , and there ’ s a built-in group chat so you can keep track of what everyone is doing . It ’ s also nice that you can play your presentation in presenter mode , which allows you to preview how it will look to your audience and rehearse timing . The only downside to Google Slides is that bloated slideshows can experience some loading delays . Also beware that while you can move between Slides and Powerpoint , the conversion often messes with the layout of your slides . An extremely impressive Microsoft Powerpoint alternative Operating system : Windows , macOS , Linux WPS Office Free is a Microsoft Office look-alike that fully support Powerpoint files without any layout issues during import . The WPS Presentation tool has all of the same capabilities of Powerpoint , including tons of animations , slide transitions , content effects , and video embedding . The selection of included presentation templates is also very impressive for a free software . One of the best things about this presentation software is that the user interface will feel incredibly familiar if you ’ re coming from Microsoft . All of the tools are displayed in a top ribbon , with your slides shown on the left side of the screen for easy navigation . It ’ s simple to display your presentation right from WPS Presentation , which means there ’ s no unexpected troubleshooting when it ’ s time to show off your work . There ’ s not much to dislike about WPS Presentation . However , keep in mind that the software is supported by ads . Some users find the ads annoying , but they ’ re not overly in the way .

The Facebook apps for iOS and Android were updated on Monday with changes to the `` Nearby '' function that helps users discover nearby businesses . In addition , Foursquare 's iOS app , which does the same while offering `` badges '' and other gamified incentives for going out , received got an update on Monday as well . Both companies are aiming to make it easier than ever to discover new hot spots with their respective updates , and each app now offers improved social functionality . Of Facebook 's reported 1 billion members , 250 million use the Nearby feature , according to USA Today , while CNET reported in April that Foursquare hit 20 million users , providing the perfect alchemy to get the updates off the ground . The new Nearby tab within the Facebook mobile app will display first and foremost nearby locations that have been recommended or checked into by friends . Rating and recommending locations and businesses will alter what your friends see when they check what 's nearby on their own devices , and vice versa . Users can also search by category , like restaurants , to pull up time-sensitive searches . `` This is an early release and there 's lots more to do , '' wrote Facebook 's Product Manager of Locations and Events Josh Williams in a news release . `` Results will get better the more people use Nearby , and we 'll continue to improve it based on feedback . '' Williams also revealed plans to integrate data from third party services in the future . Foursquare update applied only to the iOS version of the location-based check-in app . `` We 've made it even easier to decide where to go and what to do when you get there ( and to learn interesting things along the way ) '' read an official Foursquare blog post . As of Monday , when Foursquare users on iOS tap on a specific business or location , the most important information - ratings , hours , etc . - is displayed first . Once a Foursquare iOS user has checked in , the app will impart some tips and allow them to leave their own tips and ratings , in addition to alerting them to who else is at that location . Finally , once a user has checked in the Foursquare app `` highlights an important takeaway , '' like what your friend 's favorite dish there is or that you 've been to the gym for however many weeks in a row , according to Foursquare 's blog . As if you needed any other back-patting for going to the gym besides those rock-hard abs you see in the mirror , right ? Both app updates have the markings of attempts to take on Yelp , introducing an even more social slant , so it 'll be interesting to see how the search service reacts to these upstarts ' updates .
It 's beginning to look a lot like Facebook will launch another mobile messaging app , one which destroys your communiqués after a certain amount of time . The rumour fell out when All Things D gave its sources a festive shake ; they say that the app will hit before the year is out , allowing users to set how long their messages and shared photos are accessible for . Once that time period is exceeded , the photo , message or video will disappear from view and your correspondent will no longer be able to access it . It 's a lot like the functionality of Snapchat , an app which has become the sexting app of choice given its messages ' impermanence ; its makers are no doubt quaking at the thought of Facebook stomping into Snapchat 's domain . Facebook already has a selection of stand-alone mobile apps that are available separately from the traditional Facebook app . These include a Messenger app that it recently updated on Android to allow people who do n't have Facebook accounts to use it - the sources gave no indication of whether or not this more salubrious messaging app will be locked to Facebook account holders only . If the insiders are right , the new Facebook app will hit app stores by the end of the year .

Facebook users with an Android phone can now download a new app for their mobile platform from Google Play . The social network rolled out Android 2.0 , a native app that , according to Facebook , improves on speed and performance . Facebook is ditching its hybrid native and HTML5 webview experiment in favor of self-made code , to help with faster loading times , new user interfaces , disk cache and more . The native code refresh is n't all encompassing : an FB post on 2.0 noted that `` several '' of Facebook for Android 's core features were rebuilt , so the functions most everyone uses should see vast improvements . In addition to zippier uploads , quicker comments and lighting-fast liking , Facebook 's coders built out an automatically updated story banner to `` bubble up '' the newest stories without refreshing . The other most specific improvement is the ability to tap to open a photo `` so you can quickly like and comment . '' Android 2.0 follows August 's upgraded iOS app . The Facebook world got faster with version 5.0 for iOS , quelling many of the complaints that plagued the app 's buggy past . Android users should experience the same form of relief . What 's really exciting about the new app is what it means moving forward . Facebook claimed that now that the groundwork of a native code is in place , the app stands to become even better moving forward .

Facebook has revealed the trends , songs , people , movies , TV shows and memes that created a buzz among its billion users in 2012 . In the 2012 Year In Review , U.S. president Barack Obama was the most prominent person and political figure , while the presidential election was the most talked-about event on the social network . The most popular song ( presumably meaning most shared ? ) was We Are Young by Fun , followed by Somebody That I Used To Know by Gotye and , of course , Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jespen . Where 's Gangnam Style , you ask ? Well , the most viewed YouTube clip of all time was only listed among 2012 's top memes on Facebook . Popular TV shows Duck Dynasty ( a reality show about rich hunting rednecks ) and Honey Boo Boo ( another reality show about a child beauty pageant contestant ) provoked the most discussion . The Hunger Games was the most buzzworthy book and movie of the year on Facebook . Meanwhile , the most number of local check-ins came from Times Square , New York and Disneyland in California . The most talked about tech of the year was Instagram , Facebook 's own Timeline , Pinterest , Draw Something and the iPhone 5 . Facebook is also allowing users to see their own highlights via Facebook.com/yearinreview . The pages feature a neat rotating slideshow of the user 's photos and a Timeline of their most important events and posts of the year . It 's pretty neat .
On Wednesday , Facebook introduced a handful of new privacy controls to allow users better customization of what information is shared , and how it 's shared , on the social network . These updates , scheduled to roll out to everyone by the end of 2012 , will provide the necessary tools for users to better understand what information appears where . Additionally , the features will help users to remove or block content they may want kept from prying eyes . Curiously , the new security measures are coming as Facebook moves to enact new privacy policies , which will change the way the company itself shares user data . Among the ways users will be able to better manage their online profiles are new privacy shortcuts , which Facebook said will streamline the process . Previously , users had to navigate multiple pages to adjust settings for their Timeline , but options for `` Who can see my stuff ? '' and `` Who can contact me ? '' will soon be added to the top toolbar . App permissions will also change , and be easier to manage when the update arrives . As of now , the first time an app is used , it asks to access a profile and sometimes posts to a given timeline in one window . When the update arrives , those questions will be separate , allowing users to grant permissions to the app for one or the other question , rather than being handcuffed to saying `` yes '' to both immediately . While an easier user interface is going to be a big part of the new way privacy settings are handled on Facebook , the network will also provide better contextual education . To assist in helping its users better understand how privacy works on the site , new messages will appear to provide better information about who can still see posts , and where others can see them . The Activity Log will get an overhaul as well , which includes new navigation and new sorting options to better manage the way a user appears across the social network . There , users will be able to see Facebook activity including tagged photos and posts , and learn where they appear on the network outside of the Timeline . Inside the Activity Log will also be a new Request and Removal tool , which will make it easier to find things users do n't want on Facebook , and get in touch with the poster to have either the tag removed , or the content pulled entirely . Of course , it will still be up to the original poster of the material to make such a move , but having the option built into the privacy settings is a welcome touch . Whether these new features will be enough to sate those upset with Facebook 's new privacy policies remains to be seen , but at least the social network is taking some steps to make sure managing what is shared is a whole lot easier .

Facebook 's dalliance with democracy has come to an end as low voter participation will see the site eliminate the user veto system and implement data sharing with Instagram . What may become the site 's last governance policy vote ended today , with an overwhelming 88 percent of votes cast against changing the site 's governing policies and instead maintaining the policies currently in place . However , a vote requires at least 30 percent of all Facebook users to participate in order to be a binding decision . With a little more than 668,000 votes cast , the outcome will simply fall under advisement , with Facebook able to freely change the policy despite the vote 's outcome . The new policy changes would allow Facebook to share user data with other Facebook-owned sites , such as Instagram . This includes sharing data that would allow targeted ads to appear on Facebook based on a user 's Instagram info , or vice versa when ads are inevitably put in place on the photo sharing service . The change would also do away with the site 's veto policy to allow a user vote on site changes that received over 7,000 comments . The reason these particular policy changes were brought to a vote in the first place was because of the site 's veto policy . Facebook will make an announcement tomorrow regarding its official decision , but there is little doubt that the proposed policy changes will shortly go into effect . It could be argued that the lack of participation in Facebook 's policy vote is proof of the system 's irrelevance , as a majority of users will not even realize the option is gone . However , that is little solace to the nearly 600,000 users who voted to keep the old policies and not share user data between affiliate sites . In Facebook 's original proposal to change the site 's veto policy , it said that new tools would be put in motion for users to contribute policy suggestions . It will be interesting to see how effective the new policies are for taking into account user feedback , and more importantly , whether any Facebook users actually care for a change .

Google announced the launch of Google+ Communities , the big G 's version of Facebook Groups , in an official blog post on Thursday . Google+ Communities are `` a gathering place for your passions '' and `` more permanent homes for all the stuff you love , '' wrote Google Senior Vice President Vic Gundotra . Any Google+ user can create Communities , which includes features such as public/private membership , discussion categories , the ability to start hangouts and events with members of a Community , and the ability to share something with other Community members any time you hit a +1 button on any site . Current official Communities include groups centered around Audi , Call of Duty and Star Wars . Google+ Communities launched on Thursday in a non-final preview mode , and Gundotra also revealed that the feature will come to mobile devices `` soon . '' Facebook Groups have been around for years , though Google+ Communities include some additional features , like the abilities to share with Communities from any +1 button and to start a hangout with an entire Community . But despite Google+ still playing catch-up to Facebook , its user numbers have increased - according to Gundotra 's blog post , 135 million people are currently `` active '' in the Google+ stream . Compare that to 90 million registered users - many of which likely were not `` active '' - in February , eight months after Google+ 's June 2011 launch , as reported by the Wall Street Journal . As Google+ continues to gain more of the features that Facebook already has , the newer social network may continue to attract users . In Thursday 's blog post , Google also announced that Nik Software 's popular photography app Snapseed had arrived on Android devices . Snapseed , the 2011 iPad app of the year , according to Gundotra , allows users to alter photos with basic adjustments , creative filters , and some slightly more advanced features . Google acquired Nik in September , and this is the first time Snapseed has become available on Android . The app is free on Google Play as of Thursday .

Facebook has announced its 25 most popular social games for 2012 , with music trivia game SongPop taking the overall crown . The game , in which users have to guess the name of the song or artist from a brief audio sample , beat out a host of titles from Zynga , including OMGPOP 's Draw Something , which it bought earlier this year . SongPop 's popularity was boosted by the presence of an iOS and Android app that allowed for seamless cross-platform play as it took the number one spot based on user-ratings and engagement . In second place was the Facebook.com-only Dragon City game , where players breed their own dragons . Physics-based motorcycle game , Bike Race , rounded out the top three . The former undisputed king of social gaming Zynga , still managed to squeeze six titles into the top 25 with Farmville 2 , Scramble with Friends and Draw Something all making the top 10 . Given the phenomenal success of Draw Something in the early part of 2012 , it 's somewhat surprising that the Pictionary-inspired game is n't higher up the list . Facebook says the list is n't necessarily based only on how often the game is played , but how long users spend playing it and how highly it has been rated by the community . In a post on its Newsroom blog , Facebook 's head of European gaming partnerships , Julian Cordoniou wrote : `` In the social games world this year we saw the emergence of new categories of games , high quality graphics and immersive gameplay , and games built by big and small developers from around the world . `` It was the most diverse and global year for social games to date - for those on Facebook.com , as well as games built with Facebook for iPhone , iPad and Android . '' The range of high quality and beloved games from developers outside of Zynga HQ will be a boost to Facebook given how its relationship with the company changed in recent months . Zynga announced its own social gaming platform in March in order to compete with Facebook .

Facebook has decided to welcome those without Facebook accounts in to the Facebook Messaging fold . From today , some people will be able to sign up to the Facebook Messaging app on Android using just their name and phone number . This means you do n't have to be on Facebook to start instant messaging your pals through Facebook 's IM platform . Rather than Facebook friends , the Facebook-less messagers will be able to chat with their existing phone contacts – it 's basically a Facebook-branded WhatsApp . While the update to the Facebook Messenger app will roll out today , accounts will only be available to the social-networkly-challenged in Australia , India , Indonesia , South Africa and Venezuela to begin with . The rest of the world will gradually be getting the update over the coming weeks .

Social game-maker Zynga has begun to part ways from Facebook , the platform on which it struck casual gaming gold with Farmville . Facebook is restricting Zynga 's Facebook-ability from March 2012 , meaning we 'll see less Zynga promotion on the social network bringing the company more in line with other Facebook game providers . Facebook 's statement explains that this is simply a matter of `` streamlining '' the terms between the two companies . `` We have streamlined our terms with Zynga so that Zynga.com 's use of Facebook Platform is governed by the same policies as the rest of the ecosystem , '' Facebook said . `` We will continue to work with Zynga , just as we do with developers of all sizes . '' However , relations between the two companies have been strained since Zynga unveiled its own gaming portal away from Facebook , especially since it emerged that Facebook was reliant on Zynga to the tune of $ 445 million per year . Before Facebook went public in May , that amounted to 12 per cent of its total income for the year . This has n't been Zynga 's greatest year though – it blew millions of dollars on the hugely faddish Draw Something while reporting ever-lower user figures and rumblings of discontent within staff ranks .

`` We 're not going to build a phone '' - so said Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook 's earnings call yesterday , trying once again to put those Facebook phone rumours to bed . He 's said it before - that making a Facebook phone would be `` the wrong strategy '' - but it failed to stop the gears of the tech rumour mill turning . This time , the young CEO was more emphatic : `` We 're not going to build a phone . It 's not the right strategy for us to build one integrated system ... Let 's say we sell 10 million units - that would be 1 per cent of users . Who cares for us ? '' He 's starting to sound a bit Ballmer as he continues , `` We have a billion people using our products and we need to make Facebook really good across all the devices that they use . `` Rather than just building an app that 's a version of the functionality that you have today , I think making it so that we can just go deeper and deeper is going to be a big focus for us . '' While it 's not obvious what that means , we would n't be surprised to see the social network at least working more closely with the big phone manufacturers and software-makers to bed the network more deeply into phones ' operating systems . It 's already baked pretty well in to Android and iOS , but it sounds like Facebook wants to go even further . So Facebook wo n't make a phone of its own , but that does n't mean it 's not `` a mobile company '' - Zuck 's words , because for the first time ever more people are using Facebook from mobile devices than on the web . Okay Zuck . No Facebook phone . We believe you . ( Just . )

Facebook 's fourth quarter financial statement revealed some intriguing new stats for the social network . For the first time in the company 's history , the number of mobile daily active users surpassed the number of users checking Facebook on the web . With the smartphone and tablet markets seeing their numbers increase dramatically during 2012 , it should n't come as much of a surprise to learn more people are using mobile devices to stay connected to Facebook . Considering in September only 126 million people used Facebook on mobile devices , and on average , 618 million people used the website daily in December , you can see why the network is so happy with the mobile growth . `` In 2012 , we connected over a billion people and became a mobile company , '' said Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook founder and CEO , in a statement . `` We enter 2013 with good momentum and will continue to invest to achieve our mission and become a stronger , more valuable company . '' For its part , there were still 1.06 billion monthly active users on the web , which was a 25 percent increase year-over-year . Though the monthly users on mobile were barely able to reach half of the web 's total , the 680 million mobile users were still a 57 percent increase when compared to last December . That dramatic increase in mobile visits paid some impressive dividends for the advertising revenue , as Facebook 's app was responsible for 23 percent of the total , up from 14 percent in Q3 . Overall , the ad revenue for Facebook hit $ 1.33 billion ( UK£844 million , AU $ 1.28 billion ) during Q4 , which was a 41 percent increase over 2011 , and accounted for 84 percent of the total revenue . In October , Zuckerberg promised Facebook would `` monetise better per amount of time spent on mobile than desktop . '' It looks like that decision is already working to great benefit , and should continue to do so into 2013 .
Twitter may have surpassed half a billion members , according to new research outed this week . Figures from GlobalWebIndex suggest that at the end of 2012 , the microblog site had notched up a whopping 485 million members , up from 402 million just six months ago . By its estimates , GWI said that the amount of people with Twitter account now make up one third of the active global internet population . In terms of active users , the microblog now apparently has 288 million active users who 're making use of Twitter in the last month . That 's up 40 per cent in the last 6 months alone . Perhaps more interesting than the bare usage and account figures is the news of Twitter 's irrepressible growth . The 40 per cent leap in active users now outstrips progress made by Facebook , which reportedly grew 33 per cent to 693 million active users during the same period . `` An incredible 21 percent of the global internet population now use Twitter actively on a monthly basis . That marks a whopping growth rate in active users of 714 percent since July 2009 , '' GWI wrote on its official blog . Is Twitter on the path to hunting down Facebook ? Recent reports in the UK suggested that the company had lost 600,000 users in the UK in December last year would suggest that it is . Earlier this week , GWI revealed that Google+ is now up to 343 million active users to move into second place for social networks in terms of active users . Are we the only ones who find those particular figures a little less credible ?

It may have been a case of app envy , but whatever prompted Facebook to update its iOS app Monday has made it easier for users to send video and voice messages . After the update , a `` plus '' icon to the left of the text entry box expands to reveal new options for writing a wall posts or sending a message . Users can now tap the microphone icon to send quick voice messages to friends directly from their smartphone or tablet . Posting photos and videos works much the same way , letting users tap on the camera icon to record videos and post directly to Facebook without leaving the app . The update also goes beyond messaging to improve the app 's location services with the Nearby tab . With Nearby , users can check into places more accurately , showing a scrolling list of notable hotspots in the general area . While users were previously able to send short voice messages through Facebook Messenger , that functionality is now built into the regular Facebook app . Meanwhile , the addition of in-app video recording and sharing could explain the social network recently blocking access to Twitter 's Vine video app . Facebook 's official line referred to apps that `` replicate core functionality , '' which Vine 's video sharing arguably would have done now that video is a part of the core Facebook app . Whether or not the update is essentially justification for social network rivalry the new features are great news for users , who can now make more full use of their Facebook account without the need to swap between multiple apps .

Facebook launched its new `` Ask Our Chief Privacy Officer '' option Monday to try and alleviate user concerns with the social network 's privacy policies . Users can now go to Facebook 's privacy page and find a drop down option for `` Ask Erin , '' where they will find a form to submit any and all questions . All questions will be passed along to to Erin Eagan , Facebook 's chief privacy officer , who will answer a selection of questions each month . The `` Ask Erin '' option replaces Facebook 's previous system whereby users could vote for or against on any new privacy policies before they were enacted . The last vote in December proposed removing the voting policy altogether , and failed to reach the participation threshold for a binding user vote despite 88 percent of those who did vote opposing the change . The new system arguably gives users significantly less of a voice in Facebook 's privacy policies , now only letting them ask questions about policies instead of the possibility of overturning what they oppose . There is also no guarantee that a question will be answered , with Facebook encouraging users to read the Facebook Help Center for possible answers `` since Erin will not be able to respond to every question . '' Facebook 's last round of privacy updates made it easier to control who sees what you post , but will not allow a profile to be removed from searches entirely . In Eagan 's first pos , t she answered some of the more common questions , such as if Facebook sells private data to advertisers . The answer , of course , was no , with an explanation that advertisers give Facebook demographics they want to reach and Facebook uses personal data to push ads to users in that demographic . None of the personal data is actually seen by the advertiser though . If the first Ask Our CPO post is any indication , users can expect three policy questions answered each month . The answers appear to be fairly transparent , which makes them a useful resource for those curious about Facebook privacy policies , but that usefulness will also depend on the quality of the questions going forward .

Twitter launched its 6 second video app Vine on Thursday , and by Friday Facebook had already shown where it stands on the subject . Reports arrived at the end of the week that Facebook had blocked users from accessing their friends lists through Vine . When it launched on Thursday , Vine featured a `` find people '' button meant to search through a user 's Facebook friends . But Facebook reportedly blocked the feature , and now it results in an error message that says Vine is not authorized to access Facebook . The rivalry between Facebook and Twitter heated up over the last year , and now it seems the two are determined not to get along . Of course , if most users got their way , both social networks would coexist - at least that 's how it seems , given how many of our Facebook friends have linked their Twitter accounts to publish tweets as Facebook status updates . That little blue bird is all over the news feed . Then again , when have social networking companies ever put the interests of users ahead of their own ? Facebook 's apparent hostility toward Twitter is nothing new ; in December Instagram , recently acquired by Facebook , nerfed Twitter integration in a move that could only be interpreted as an act of social warfare . TechRadar asked Facebook determine for certain whether the company is intentionally blocking Vine users and whether that could change in the future . The company has not yet responded , however . Facebook Director of Platform Partnerships and Operations Justin Osofsky did post an update to Facebook 's developer blog on Friday writing , `` For the vast majority of developers building social apps and games , keep doing what you 're doing . '' But `` for a much smaller number of apps that are using Facebook to either replicate our functionality or bootstrap their growth in a way that creates little value for people on Facebook , such as not providing users an easy way to share back to Facebook , we 've had policies against this that we are further clarifying today . '' He linked to Facebook 's platform policies and referred readers to section I.10 , titled `` Reciprocity and Replicating core functionality . '' Of course , all of Facebook 's posturing could be just a cover-up for not wanting to play nice with the competition , but ultimately it 's difficult to say for sure .

It was a hard fought battle all year long , but when the final tally was taken , only one mobile app would stand taller than the rest . According to the latest data from comScore , the Facebook app was 2012 's most downloaded in the U.S. , narrowly edging out Google Maps for the top spot . Based on the number of downloads both apps received , the race was neck-and-neck for most of the year , with Facebook managing to pull ahead in the final three months . It did n't have anything to do with any performance enhancing stimulants though , as Facebook 's turn of luck neatly coincided with Google Maps being dropped from iOS 6 . As soon as Apple cut ties with Google Maps , Facebook skyrocketed to the top of the download charts , and easily surpassed Google Maps for the next three months . However , even though Facebook ended the year with 85,574 downloads to Google Maps ' 74,631 , the battle between the rivals is far from over . Google Maps saw its downloads increase during the final month of 2012 , and thanks in large part to being reinstated on the Apple App Store , could return to its former glory as 2013 progresses . That said , it 's worth noting Facebook also accounted for 23-percent of time spent using a mobile app , while all of Google 's apps combined registered just 10-percent of the usage . Both companies are responsible for one minute out of every three a person spends using a mobile app . Though Facebook may be king of apps for now , Google can certainly claim to hold a bigger majority on the remainder of the top ten . In fact , four Google apps help round out the top five , with Google Play ( 61,461 ) , Google Search ( 60,587 ) , and GMail ( 53,934 ) taking the next three spots respectively . The only other app to crack the 50K barrier was YouTube , which was downloaded 52,572 times by U.S. users . Pandora ( 48,023 ) , iTunes ( 45,884 ) , and Cooliris ( 42,927 ) all managed to surpass 40K downloads each , with the number ten app , Yahoo ! Messenger , just missing out and clocking in with 36,124 . With more competition sure to arise in 2013 as more and more consumers adopt smartphones , and thus become more comfortable using phones for services like eBay , Amazon , Netflix , and more , the race will be tighter than ever .

Facebook has updated its native app for Android , bringing a couple of new features and improvements to the photo viewing experience . The social network claims that photos will load faster in the new version of the app , launched on Friday , so depending on your device and connection speed , you should see a boost . The Facebook 2.1 update , available from the Google Play store now , will also allow Android users to send voice messages , a feature previously limited to the Facebook Messenger app . Finally , the update expands options for sharing content . As well as posting updates to their own Timeline , users can now share to Groups , friends ' Timelines and to Pages they have Liked . The update follows the last major update , just over a month ago , which rebooted the app with Facebook 's own native code , bringing much faster performance than its HTML5-based predecessor . Check out Samsung 's Your Mobile Life to discover loads more about the infinite possibilities of the GALAXY Note II The company has promised to update its mobile apps every 4-8 weeks as it seeks to capitalise on the ever-growing number of users doing most of their browsing through smartphones and tablets .

Google is seemingly everywhere these days , and it 's expected the company will only grow bigger in 2013 and beyond . From its social networking with Google+ , to mobile and tablet Android devices like the Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 , to the widely used search engine , there 's nary an area of daily life that Google does n't have a hand in . That 's not to say Google is the leader of the pack , or without its fair share of competition from the likes of Facebook and Apple . With just a few elite companies vying for that all-important user base , you would think Google CEO Larry Page would be more concerned with the opposition . However , based on statements given in a recent interview , Page believes Google succeeded in spite of competition , merely because it 's `` doing something different . '' Speaking with Wired , Page discussed the genesis of Google+ , and though Facebook was already well-established in the social networking landscape , he believed there was space for another option . `` We had real issues with how our users shared information , how they expressed their identity , and so on , '' Page said . `` And , yeah , [ Facebook is ] a company that 's strong in that space . But they 're also doing a really bad job on their products . For us to succeed , is it necessary for some other company to fail ? No . We 're actually doing something different . '' Page likened the situation to the early days of Google itself , when nobody believed another search engine could survive in an already crowded arena . `` I think it 's outrageous to say that there 's only space for one company in these areas , '' Page continued . `` When we started with search , everyone said , 'You guys are gon na fail , there 's already five search companies . ' We said , 'We are a search company , but we 're doing something different . ' That 's how I see all these areas . '' As for what Page thinks of Google+ as it stands now , the CEO added he was happy with its progress , and he could tell they were doing a good job based on competitors aping what Google was doing . Facebook was n't the only company Page skewered in the rare interview , as he took the chance to throw a few barbs Apple 's way as well . When discussing how he felt companies only failed because of lack of ambition , not litigation or competition , Page brushed off the idea Apple 's iOS was any competitor to Android . When Steve Jobs claimed to `` go to thermonuclear war '' on the Android operating system , Page merely replied , `` How well is that working ? '' As of November , Android sat atop the market with a 75 percent share , while iOS had fallen far behind - just under 15-percent . Page also discussed how he thought a less open operating system hindered innovation , and though he did n't single out Apple specifically in that case , the point was clear . `` Our philosophy has always been to get our products out to as many people as possible . Unfortunately , that 's not always easy in this day and age , '' Page said . `` Now we 're going backward with a lot of the platforms that are out there . Companies are trying to wall everything off , and I think that impedes the rate of innovation . '' With Page at the helm , Google appears to be headed in the right direction in leading technology and its users further into the future . There are rumors about Google X , a new phone and tablet line born from the acquisition of Motorola Mobility . There 's the continuing evolution of the Android OS , with Key Lime Pie 's release just off the horizon , and a whole slew of Android gaming devices slated to arrive at some point in the next year . The company 's annual event , Google IO , is set to go down in May , and Page and Co. will likely have plenty of new innovations to show off then as well . Regardless of the competition , it seems Page is content to allow Google to march to the beat of its own drum , and he has high hopes for what lies ahead . `` We 're one of the bigger companies of the world , '' he said . `` And I 'd like to see us do more stuff - not just do what somebody else has done , but something new .

Earlier this month , Facebook began testing voice-over IP calling within its iOS Messenger app in Canada , with a goal of expansion to other platforms and territories . On Wednesday , the feature became a reality for U.S. customers , as free calling is now an option to iPhone users with Messenger . Read more : Vonage Business Cloud Though the option still is n't available to those using Android , the option to place calls to another Messenger user for free over a Wi-Fi connection is undoubtedly a big step in Facebook 's grand plan for global domination ... we mean , offering awesome services to users . However , there is still no way to video conference , despite Facebook 's deal with Skype that provides video chat through the network 's online portal . With VoIP being made available to more consumers through the Messenger app , the next logical step would be to roll out the feature to more users and more countries . Facebook has certainly spent a lot of time changing how its users are able to interact with one another in recent months , and one has to wonder just how the company will continue to evolve over the next year . We already know the company is testing out a pay-to-message system , with new reports indicating Facebook is trying out a $ 100 price point to message someone you 've never met . While that test is only being put to use on the web for the time being , if it proves successful for Facebook , there 's a chance that option could find its way to the app , and then subsequently to the phone call option . For now , it appears Facebook is content to merely compete with other VoIP services like Vonage for customers . TechRadar asked Facebook for more on the matter , and will update this story if and when the company responds .
Facebook launched a new search thing yesterday . It was n't a Facebook phone . It was n't a mobile OS . It was a search thing called Graph Search . What does that even mean , Graph Search ? No one calls their Facebook stuff Graph except for people who work at Facebook . Basically , it 's a revamped search tool that lets you find the friendly needle in your social media haystack by looking through all Facebook content that 's been shared with you or is public - that includes friends , friends ' interests , photos , games , apps and so on . Terrible name and the fact that it is still basically just search aside , we thought we 'd better see what was what . So we 've had a good old go on Facebook Graph Search because , well , any excuse to nose through our friends ' stuff . Is it a killer Facebook feature ? Are you going to wonder how you ever lived without it ? Let 's find out . When Graph Search rolls out to your account , the search bar at the top of your news feed becomes a solid blue box inviting you to search for `` people , places and things '' . If you take that literally and search for `` people , places and things '' , Graph Search does n't just call you facetious and kick you out of your account ( though we deserved it ) . Instead , it offers some suggestions : Like , did you mean `` People who like places and my favourite things '' ? Sure , Facebook . What have you got for me ? Well , more than 1,000 people as it turns out , starting with people I 'm friends with ( nine results ) and going on to those I share mutual friends with and then diving into the never-ending pool of people I do n't have any connection with . The drop-down suggestion box is equal parts useful and garment-rendingly frustrating . It 's constantly zipping about trying to guess what you 're going to ask , and comes up with suggestions that are so completely irrelevant that it annoys me just to see them . Sometimes it 's bang on though , and saves you valuable typing seconds . It 's a beta service so you can forgive these little irritations to a point . Searching is pretty straightforward - you can go into as little or as much detail as you like . You can go with `` My friends who like Home Alone '' all the way through to `` Photos of friends of friends who like Home Alone taken in Spain in 2009 '' . In the current iteration of Facebook Graph Search you ca n't search negatives - so we could n't find `` my friends who like TechRadar and do n't work at Future Publishing '' or `` My friends who do n't like bears '' ( so we could de-friend them ) . As well as picking through friends ' photos , you can search for restaurants within certain parameters ( e.g . Restaurants nearby , which plays quite fast and loose with the definition of nearby ) and see which outlets your friends Like to get an idea of whether they 're worth a visit . Facebook also wants you to use Graph Search to find new games and apps to use on the social network . This is good for Facebook because you 'll probably spend more time on the site , not to mention possibly making a few in-app purchases here and there , and recommending the games to your friends , and so on until we 're all on Facebook all the time , giving Zuckerberg all our money . Searching for `` Games my friends play '' gives you a good starting point , then you can dig down into the hundreds of results using the `` Refine this search '' filters on the right - things like game type , who likes the game and which of your friends use the game .
Facebook 's big announcement turned out to be very big indeed : Social Graph Search , which will enable you to stalk exes and search for things such as `` vulnerable women near me who 've been dumped in the last few weeks '' and `` pictures of my friends ' female friends in bikinis '' . That 's not what Facebook says , of course . According to it , we 'll be able to get astonishingly useful search results : not just `` find me a fusion restaurant in Manchester '' , but `` Find me a fusion restaurant in Manchester that my Mancunian friends love and that everybody who goes there raves about . '' All we need to do is let Facebook monitor us 24/7 and share everything we do with the entire planet . With a straight face , Facebook says that Social Graph Search has been `` built with privacy in mind '' : nothing you do n't want shared will be searchable . There are only two problems with that . One , Facebook . And two , everyone on the internet . Facebook first . Facebook says that the Social Graph search wo n't uncover things that are n't already public , and that 's true . Unfortunately , though , Facebook is awfully good at the whole 'Oopsie ! Did we accidentally bump into your privacy settings and make all your private stuff public again ? Man , we 're always doing that ! We 're such klutzes ! ' thing . Without fail , whenever Facebook announces an improvement to its privacy tools , it makes stuff I do n't want public , public . For example , about two weeks ago Facebook announced new , simpler privacy tools . I checked my settings , and my friends-only posts were now public . I changed the setting back , and yesterday Facebook announced new , better privacy tools . You 'll never guess what my posts ' default setting was this morning . This is not the kind of behaviour that makes you trust a company . The other concern is that bits of data that do n't amount to much can be a very big deal when they 're combined : even really innocuous stuff can end up biting you in the backside . The Electronic Frontier Foundation gives the example of liking a Samsung Mobile page in college and then going on to work for Apple . Turning up in a search of `` people who like Samsung Mobile and work for Apple '' would be embarrassing . The possibilities can be quite scary , given that Facebook enables and encourages people to post details of their relationship status , religious views , sexuality , political views and so on . Imagine the searches predators , bigots and other fun people might use the Social Graph for - especially if those searches are location-aware . And they will be : writing in Wired , Steven Levy says that `` Before long , Zuckerberg says , searching capabilities will be added to Facebook 's mobile apps too . Though he wo n't share the product specs , you can bet that Graph Search on phones will include location , adding a powerful new dimension . '' The future might include notifications , too , so Facebook would notify you if someone meeting your particular criteria was nearby , and the indexing will ultimately include not just likes and information people provide in their profiles , but the actual content of their status updates and news feed conversations too . What could possibly go wrong ? I 've been covering online privacy long enough to know things are rarely as dire as predicted - the future usually turns out to be annoying rather than sinister - but there is a worry here : to make this work , and Facebook really wants it to work , it needs to massively increase the amount of stuff everybody shares on the site and on sites where Facebook has buttons and comments . If it happens elsewhere , Social Graph ca n't index it . That means Facebook does n't just want to be Facebook . It wants to be Yelp , and LinkedIn , and GoodReads , and Spotify , and Flickr , and everything else you do on the internet . It wants to know what you buy , what you listen to , what you like and where you go , and it wants to share that information with everyone . If you think Facebook is noisy , annoying and invasive now , just wait until Social Graph search becomes its bread and butter .

In what some are sure to consider an underwhelming press event today , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced Graph Search , a search tool that wades through the billions of bits of data on the site to come up with results to super-specific queries . However , not all answers are housed in Facebook 's data catacombs , and for searches that are n't Graph Search indexed , the social network has chosen Bing to provide users with info on web searches for things like local weather . `` There 's an integration between Bing and Graph Search so that Bing picks up when Graph ca n't deliver relevant results , '' Lars Rasmussen , director of engineering at Facebook , said during the event , as reported by Engadget . Zuckerberg picked up that thread : `` We 're working with Microsoft to incorporate social signals into search , and Microsoft is helping Graph Search improve . '' Facebook 's aim is to make search social , and the assembled FB team made it clear Bing is doing just that . But when asked about whether Facebook considered working with Google on its search venture , privacy apparently played a significant role in the decision of which company to partner with . `` We would love to work with Google , '' Zuckerberg said . `` We just wanted to incorporate search , and as long as the companies are willing to honor the privacy of folks sharing content on Facebook , we 'll work with them . We just have n't gotten it worked out with Google yet . '' When pressed to elaborate on privacy issues with the Mountain View company , Zuckerberg alluded to some sticking points that might have swayed its decision to move forward with Microsoft as a sole search partner for now . `` The main thing is that when people share something on Facebook , we want to give them the ability to broadcast things , but also retract them later , and have them be removed immediately , '' he said . `` Microsoft was more willing to do things specific to Facebook . '' Zuckerberg made a concerted effort to emphasize user privacy during the event , and clearly wants a partner that will stick to the `` Facebook way , '' keeping privacy at the forefront ( at least during public events like this ) as Graph Search evolves . What internal conversations have or have n't taken place between Google and Facebook we ca n't know , but time will tell if there are future partnership changes afoot . Or , Google could view this as an aggressive move into its search turf , in which case the lines in the sand are drawn .
Well , Facebook did n't reveal a new phone or operating system today - instead the social network announced a new Graph Search . This new feature offers a multitude of new ways to use Facebook 's search function to help you find the right people , photos and more . You can still search in the usual way , but you can also ask Graph Search to find exactly what you 're looking for . Launching now is the beta ( or early ) version of Graph Search , and it focuses on four areas : people , photos , places and interests . It 's only available in U.S. English for now . Graph Search is a new way for you to find people , photos , places and interests that are most relevant to you on Facebook . You 'll be able to find others even though you may not know their name , as well as learn more about them and make connections . What 's more , you can explore photos , quickly find places like local attractions and restaurants , and learn about friends ' common interests such as music , movies and books . Graph Search appears as a bigger search bar at the top of each page . As you start to type , suggestions appear in a drop down . You can refine your search using the tools on the right-hand side of the page . `` When you search for something , that search not only determines the set of results you get , but also serves as a title for the page , '' says Facebook director of engineering Lars Rasmussen . `` You can edit the title – and in doing so create your own custom view of the content you and your friends have shared on Facebook . '' Your Graph Search query can be very specific . One example given at Facebook 's launch event was `` people named Chris who are friends of Lars and went to Stanford '' – so you really can find someone you met once and remember by mere association . You can also use a search example like `` my friends who like Lady Gaga '' or `` photos of Sue taken in Bristol in 2005 . '' Facebook says there are more than a billion people on the social network who have posted 240 billion photos and have more than a trillion connections . The company believes it needs to provide `` the tools to map out their relationships with the people and things they care about . '' Facebook refers to this map as `` the graph . '' `` When Facebook first launched , the main way most people used the site was to browse around , learn about people and make new connections , '' says Rasmussen . `` Graph Search takes us back to our roots and allows people to use the graph to make new connections . '' Graph Search and web search are very different , explains Rasmussen . `` Web search is designed to take a set of keywords ( for example : 'hip hop ' ) and provide the best possible results that match those keywords . `` With Graph Search you combine phrases ( for example : `` my friends in New York who like Jay-Z '' ) to get that set of people , places , photos or other content that 's been shared on Facebook . We believe they have very different uses . '' Facebook says that Graph Search has been built with privacy in mind , primarily because often it 's searching content that 's very appropriate to you , but its completely different from something that somebody else would see if they did the same search . According to Facebook , the Graph Search `` respects the privacy and audience of each piece of content on Facebook , '' meaning you 'll only see results you could already see elsewhere on Facebook . The social network says they 're `` very early '' in the development of Graph Search . It 's only available in the U.S. today , and you can search for only a subset of content on Facebook – people , photos , places and interests only at the moment . Posts and some auto-generated content – such as song plays from Spotify – ca n't yet be searched . People : `` friends who live in my city '' ; `` people from my hometown who like hiking '' ; `` friends of friends who have been to Yosemite National Park '' ; `` software engineers who live in San Francisco and like skiing '' ; `` people who like things I like '' ; `` people who like tennis and live nearby '' Photos : `` photos I like '' ; `` photos of my family '' ; `` photos of my friends before 1999 '' ; `` photos of my friends taken in New York '' ; `` photos of the Eiffel Tower '' Places : `` restaurants in San Francisco '' ; `` cities visited by my family '' ; `` Indian restaurants liked by my friends from India '' ; `` tourist attractions in Italy visited by my friends '' ; `` restaurants in New York liked by chefs '' ; `` countries my friends have visited '' Interests : `` music my friends like '' ; `` movies liked by people who like movies I like '' ; `` languages my friends speak '' ; `` strategy games played by friends of my friends '' ; `` movies liked by people who are film directors '' ; `` books read by CEOs ''
Facebook introduced its new social network search tool today , dubbed Graph Search . With search engines and phones and mobile OSes all mooted , the internet may have got a little bit carried away with speculation ahead of Facebook 's big event today . Instead , we 're looking at a powerful search tool that uses specific filters to help you navigate through all the billions of photos , people and connections housed on the site . Facebook will still offer its traditional search tool , but this new Graph Search bar requires you to ask Graph Search for exactly what you 're looking for . Launching today is the beta version of Graph Search , and it focuses on four areas : people , photos , places and interests . The queries can be insanely specific . One example given at Facebook 's launch event was `` people named Chris who are friends of Lars and went to Stanford . '' Other examples include looking for `` my friends who like Home Alone '' ( add them straight to your favourites ) or `` photos of Gareth taken in Barcelona in 2009 . '' When you 're looking for something specific on Facebook , this could save you a lot of time . It could also be a mad stalking time-sink . A number of examples given during Facebook 's event were kind of creepy dating queries like , hey , Facebook , find me `` friends of friends who like Star Wars and hats and eating spaghetti on Tuesdays . '' We might have elaborated slightly , but Facebook wants you to make new connections using this tool and that seems kind of sleazy . On the plus side , your searches will only return results containing Facebook content that has been shared with you or is public - Facebook was keen to ensure you know that your privacy is well looked after . Additionally , it was announced that Bing answers will also appear in search results for queries that are n't yet indexed . For example , if you need to know the weather , Facebook will cull meteorological results for you . Facebook Graph Search beta is launching today , but you 'll have to sign up to the waiting list before you 'll get access . To do that , head over to the Facebook Graph Search .
Facebook is busy `` building '' something that will be revealed at an event later today , and the latest reports suggest that it could be a search engine . `` What , no Facebook phone ? '' we hear you cry . Given the dearth of leaks , we 'd say new hardware is unlikely to be unveiled today - not to mention the fact that Mark Zuckerberg publicly stated that knocking out a handset would be the `` wrong strategy '' for the company . But something big is coming , and Pocket-Lint is reporting that `` inside sources '' have told it that Facebook 's plan is to launch a Google-baiting search engine . The sources added that the new search feature is expected to roll out shortly after today 's event . Whatever the announcement is , the mere fact that it 's happening caused Facebook shares to jump as financiers get excited about all the potential money-reaping tweaks that the social network has in mind for its 800 million plus active users . We 'll be covering the Facebook event as it happens , so check back at 10am PT , 6pm GMT for the news as it breaks .

Facebook is testing a new money-spinner whereby you pay to send messages to people you are n't friends with . Chancing its arm , Facebook has offered some users the option to pay $ 100 for the privilege . That might be a price you 'd consider paying if you were a crazed One Directioner getting the opportunity to message Harry Styles , but will probably seem a bit steep if you 're just hoping to get in touch with an average Joe you think you might know from school but you 're not 100 per cent sure . The social network explains that it 's trying out `` some extreme price points '' to see `` what works to filter spam '' - some users have been given the option of paying $ 1 . It looks as though this monetary messaging simply means your note will be delivered to a person 's inbox rather than the wily 'Other ' folder which houses communiques from people you are n't directly connected to on the site and group updates . The $ 100 price tag first popped up at the tail end of 2012 , when the keen Mark Zuckerberg fans over at Mashable discovered they could buy the privilege of messaging the Facebook founder 's inbox by dropping a Franklin on it , but it seems lesser Facebook users are now generating the same value . It 's possible that users will get a bespoke value based on how popular they are on Facebook , as is the case with promoted profile posts . Facebook really is dead set on wringing money out of you , one way or another . Via The Verge , Mashable

A tweak to Facebook 's algorithms now give a more accurate view of what brands are most popular among the local population . Previously , Facebook showed top brands in a given territory or country but it still showed worldwide fan numbers , giving a skewed view of what companies your compatriots like . Now the data has been released to let analytical tools show what brands are really top of the pops . For instance : in the UK iTunes is in the top ten by worldwide fans but it falls off that list when you look at how many Brits have actually liked the Apple brand . In the US the results are pretty similar to before the change but the data shows that Starbucks is a strong global player , with under half of its fans coming from its home region . Similarly , only one in five fans of the Coca Cola page originate from the US - and why 30 % of Samsung Mobile USA fans come from outside the region is beyond us . Check out the graphs below from Socialbakers.com to see how things have changed thanks to the new localised data - if nothing else , you 'll probably click to look at a penguin in a swimming pool full of Skittles .

Something big is coming from Facebook next week - or so we infer from an invite the the social network has been sending out for an event at its San Francisco HQ . `` Come and see what we 're building , '' the invite reads , getting the internet 's collective tongue wagging about possible Facebook hardware . Could the 'book be double bluffing on the whole Facebook phone thing ? Is Zuckerberg taking the network the way of Amazon with a Facebook tablet on the cards ? Of course , it could be that Facebook is simply 'building ' some new profile features intended to appease investors and eke money out of its one billion monthly active users . The Facebook phone is the rumour that wo n't die , however - even Mark Zuckerberg 's protestations that it would be `` the wrong strategy '' failing to quiet murmurings that HTC is working on hardware for the company . Either way , the present tense used in the invite implies that whatever it is that Facebook 's cooking up is n't quite ready yet . TechRadar will be with Facebook on Tuesday evening so stay tuned to see what the network has up its sleeve - we 'll bring you the news as it breaks .

Facebook has begun rolling out a new Timeline layout which groups all your friends ' public communiques on one side of the wall while other bits and pieces are locked to the other . This makes the whole thing look a bit less 'timeline-y ' but does mean a cleaner , easier to read layout without any danger of you missing anything on your own wall . Sorry , timeline . Thing . Whatever . Wait a minute , you 're thinking . This is n't a CES 2013 story ! And you 're right - we 're as surprised to be writing it as you are to be reading it .

Facebook took another step towards total global domination on Thursday when the social network revealed it was testing a new feature for its Messenger app . In an effort to appease its users and potentially gain even more , Facebook is now trying out free voice calling over Wi-Fi through Messenger . Though it 's currently limited to the iOS version of the app in Canada , Facebook hopes to roll out the feature to Android users and other territories soon enough . For now , those of you outside of the Great White North , and not using iPhones , will have to make do with the limited ability to send short voice messages via the app . Even though this feature is only in the testing stages and does n't offer video conferencing , Facebook has an immense opportunity to capture a lot of users for voice over IP calling . Services like Skype and Vonage already offer similar service , but do n't have quite the customer base Facebook does with its hundreds of millions of users . If this feature was ever to move out of the test phase , the potential for Facebook to change how its users communicate with each other is huge . Facebook has run more than a few tests in various markets before , with several tests currently ongoing for many users . As interesting as Facebook 's previous trials were , none had quite as much game changing potential as this free Wi-Fi calling . There 's no telling when or where Facebook will be trying out this new venture next , but if the response is strong from this initial phase , it might not be long until phone bills are a thing of the past for Facebook users .

Facebook has today been accused of unfairly favouring Instagram after banning photo uploads from a popular rival iPhone app . The makers of Vintage Camera , which like Facebook-owned Instagram allows users to add retro-style filters to photos , were recently shocked to hear the social network had restricted uploads from the app . When developers Presselite appealed , Facebook cited `` negative feedback from users and their friends '' and said it would not be restoring functionality to the app , which has an estimated 8 million users . The ban , according to Presselite , is despite Vintage Camera receiving only one negative report per 1,000 images the community of users had uploaded . The French company suspects foul play and suggested that Facebook may be seeking to eliminate rival services that may potentially pose a threat to Instagram . Co-founder Antoine Morcos said in a statement : `` We do n't understand how Facebook could block the access to millions of users of the Vintage Camera application who want to share their photos on Facebook , only because of a few negative feedback reports `` As you all know , Facebook has acquired the Instagram photo-sharing application , and we hope this acquisition is not influencing this kind of access limitation for other photo applications . '' In response , Facebook told the BBC that Vintage Camera had been subject to several warnings before its access was restricted and had chances to fall in line with its policies . The social network said : `` Pending on the violation , we give developers an opportunity to come into compliance via a warning system . `` In the case of this application , the application was not in compliance with our platform policies and had received three warnings prior to our systems taking action on the application . '' TechRadar asked Facebook for further clarification and will update this story if and when a response is forthcoming . Via BBC
Because talk is cheap unless it 's online , Facebook is teaming up with mobile partners to offer free or discounted data to people using Facebook Messaging . The social networking giant has signed up a number of partners across various territories to offer the service . It will work on Facebook Messenger Android , for iOS and Facebook for Every Phone which is apparently optimized for chat . So which lucky people will soon find their data usage a little less expensive ( assuming they are Facebook chatter of course ) ? Well there are 18 operators in 14 countries - none of which are the United Kingdom , the US or Australia . This is probably more important for smaller nations , where the cost of data is prohibitive - but it 's nevertheless a nice move by Facebook . And lest you think that Facebook chat is not a major service in the grand scheme of things , apparently three out of every four people send a message on the platform every month .

Facebook is building a vast new data centre in order to archive all of the content its members rarely access . A brand new 16,000 square-foot facility is under construction in Prineville , Oregon in the United States , where Facebook plans to keep all of those old photos , wall posts and status updates from bygone eras . The social network claims that 8 per cent of the images uploaded account for around 85 per cent of the traffic generated by photos at any one time . So , the idea behind the new slow-running `` cold storage '' centre is to cut Facebook 's energy costs by making the rarely accessed content less immediately available . However , this does n't mean you 're going to have to wait in line to take a stroll down memory lane and bring up your photo album from Kavos '08 . `` The principle will be so that it does n't impact the user experience - so think about a matter of seconds , or milliseconds , '' a Facebook spokesperson said . The new facility , which joins two others in Prineville , will allow for the storage of an exabyte of data , which is the equivalent of 250 million DVDs .

Despite recording annual profits of over a billion dollars in 2012 , Facebook will scoop a giant tax refund in its homeland , much to the chagrin of tax activists in the US . The social network announced earnings of $ 1.06 billion ( UK£0.63 , AUD $ 1.029 ) at the end of last year , but tax breaks mean they 'll also recover a $ 429m ( UK£276 , AUD $ 416 ) net tax refund from Uncle Sam . How , you ask ? Well because of its IPO in May 2012 , Facebook was able to apply for a whopping tax break covering stock options for executives , while refunds from earlier years also contributed to the pot . The company saved $ 1.03 billion ( UK£0.66 , AUD $ 1 ) in federal and state taxes because of the tax break , while the same loophole will allow it to avoid paying another $ 2.17 billion ( UK£1.4 , AUD $ 2.1 ) in years to come . Facebook claimed to have a `` tax liability '' of $ 559 ( UK£360 , AUD $ 542 ) million for 2012 , but the `` excess tax benefits '' listed above flips that liability into a tidy little profit for the publicly traded company . Facebook 's filing has angered US tax research and lobbying group Citizens for Tax Justice , who pointed out the figures in its detailed analysis of Facebook 's end-of-year report . However , as strange as it seems for a company as large as Facebook to be receiving cash back from the government , as Bloomberg Businessweek pointed out , the company is n't breaking any rules , just employing a little `` accounting wizardry . '' `` Companies like Facebook are allowed to treat the cost of non-cash compensation , such as stock options , as an expense that reduces profits , essentially the way they treat cash compensation such as salaries , '' it said . If you do n't mind encountering a little financial jargon , check out CTJ 's analysis of the situation for some eye-opening insight into how tax legislation can be used to benefit the corporate elite .

There 's no hiding behind a fake name on Facebook for anyone who can honestly say `` Ich bin ein Berliner '' ( I am a Berliner ) . The social networking site can legally continue to require users in Germany to register with their real names thanks to its courtroom win against a German privacy watchdog group . In December , the Schleswig-Holstein data protection body had ordered Facebook to change its real-name policy and allow users the option to use a fictitious name . The right to use pseudonyms online is enshrined in German law , said the body . This reversal is good news for Facebook , which is just one of many tech companies to have run-ins with strict German privacy laws . `` We are pleased with the decision of the Administrative Court of Appeals of Schleswig-Holstein , '' a Facebook spokesperson told TechRadar . `` We believe this is a step in the right direction . `` We hope that our critics will understand that it is the role of individual services to determine their own policies about anonymity within the governing law – for Facebook Ireland European data protection and Irish law . '' Previously , Facebook saw its auto-facial recognition feature declared illegal in Germany . Facebook 's mention of Irish law is no accident . The Associated Press pointed out that the company 's European headquarters is in Ireland . This means that the Facebook is subject to Ireland 's less stringent privacy laws and is outside of the Schleswig court 's jurisdiction . Schleswig-Holstein state 's data protection body said that it will appeal the decision , but for now , real names remain a Facebook requirement in Deutschland . Via Associated Press
Facebook recently discovered some of its employees ' laptops were hacked , though it does n't look like any serious harm was done . The social network posted the news on its blog today , saying the firm did n't find any evidence that user data was compromised . Good news for its 800 million-plus active users . `` Last month , Facebook Security discovered that our systems had been targeted in a sophisticated attack , '' the blog post state quite simply . While it acknowledged the hack , Facebook did n't share what , if anything , the perpetrators gained access to . Facebook identified the `` zero-day Java exploit '' as the method of attack . It said a handful of employees visited a compromised mobile developer website that installed malware on their laptops . The hackers took advantage of a weakness in Oracle 's Java software enabled on web browsers , even though Facebook said its anti-virus software was up to date . The company noted it was a previously undiscovered exploit . The social network said Facebook Security flagged a suspicious domain in its DNS logs and tracked it back to an employee 's laptop . After the malware was discovered , the security team conducted a company-wide search and fixed the remaining infected machines . Though it seems like Facebook has the security breach under control , it does n't look like this is an isolated incident . `` Facebook was not alone in this attack , '' the same blog post read . `` It is clear that others were attacked and infiltrated recently as well . '' In the beginning of February , Twitter was also comprised by hackers , affecting 250,000 user accounts . Before that , the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal were targeted by large-scale attacks . Facebook did n't mention any connection to the Twitter or the newspaper attacks in its post . However , Twitter 's Director of Information Security , Bob Lord , advised that people should turn off Java on their browsers when its attack was made public . He also noted that Apple and Mozilla have turned off Java in each company 's browsers after many security questions had been raised about Oracle 's software . Though there has been no official mention of any link , Java is the common concern . That might mean the attacks could be coming from the same group or individual , or just that different malicious entities are using the same exploits . Whatever the case , turning off Java on your browser is increasingly looking like the smart move to make .

Facebook 's 'like ' button is the star of a new lawsuit against the social network . A deceased Dutchman 's estate claims to hold the patent for similar features that were allegedly developed for 'Surfbook ' , a social network that never saw the light of day . The inventor in question was Joannes Jozef Everardus Van Der Meer who passed away in 2004 before he could implement his patents . Granted in 1998 , the patents cover creation of `` a 'diary ' containing multimedia references to contents of websites… with the specific intent of making the content objects available to a user to place in his diary '' - all using a 'like ' style button . The second patent covers a chronological `` catalog of network objects of interest to the user '' - which is basically the newsfeed or timeline . It all does sound pretty familiar , to be fair - and the lawyers also claim that Facebook is aware of the patents , having cited them in its own patent applications . A patent holding company is suing on behalf of van Der Meer , saying that the patents in question `` represent an important foundation of social media as we know it '' . But this is n't the first time that some third party has tried to claim responsibility for Facebook 's success ; the Winkelvoss twins , Paul Allen , Yahoo… Via BBC
If you 're having trouble accessing Facebook right now , you 're not alone - the site is experiencing a few difficulties . Although some are able to get onto the site with no problems , others are encountering DNS errors or a major site slow-down . There 's no official statement on the glitches but Facebook tells us it 's aware of the difficulties and is working on a fix . We hope you can all stay strong during this difficult time . Hopefully full working status will be restored soon and we can all get back to liking , poking , messaging and whatever else the kids do on there these days soon . We do n't mean to brag but TechRadar is having no problem Facebooking with gay abandon - if you 're one of the lucky ones , why not join us ?
A US security company has developed a product that mines data from social networks to secretly monitor any citizen and predict their movements , Minority Report style . Raytheon is the multinational firm behind the Rapid Information Overlay Technology ( RIOT ) , which uses information gleaned from Facebook , Twitter , Foursquare and Gowalla , among other networks . In a video demonstration , the company 's principal investigator Brian Urch showed how easily the software can analyse your past movements and use them to predict future ones . Firing up a browser page that looks like an evil Google , he tapped the name of a staff member into the Riot browser , returning a host of social network-based results . He then pulled out the staffer 's check-ins which were instantly plotted on a map . Urch also explained that the software can plot locations pulled from uploaded photos ' EXIF data . Using RIOT , Urch told us that the best place to find this particular staff member was at the gym on a Monday morning , around 6am . As well as location and photographical data , RIOT analyses your connections across networks and displays them in handy graphical format . While Raytheon says it has n't sold the RIOT program to anyone `` yet '' , it did concede that the US government `` and industry '' have seen RIOT . `` Riot is a big data analytics system design we are working on with industry , national labs and commercial partners to help turn massive amounts of data into useable information to help meet our nation 's rapidly changing security needs , '' Jared Adams , a spokesperson for the firm told the Guardian . `` Its innovative privacy features are the most robust that we 're aware of , enabling the sharing and analysis of data without personally identifiable information [ such as social security numbers , bank or other financial account information ] being disclosed . '' While the company positions itself as allowing a kind of `` private '' monitoring for the greater defensive good , it will no doubt leave many people feeling exposed . Time to delete that Foursquare account ?

Facebook has honoured its vow to delete all data from its massively unpopular facial recognition experiment in the EU , regulators have confirmed . Data protection bodies in Germany and Ireland have studied Facebook 's source code and are happy that the social network has deleted any information it may have gleaned while the feature was live . The tech , which guessed who appeared in photos so users could tag their friends more easily , caused a privacy storm in Europe and Facebook soon agreed to remove it from the site . In September of last year , Facebook said all data would be purged and it appears that the company , which has its UK base in Dublin , has been true to its vow . Ciara O'Sullivan , spokeswoman for the Office of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner said : `` We recently reviewed the source code and execution process used in the deletion process and can confirm that we were satisfied with the processes used by Facebook to delete the templates in line with its commitment . '' Ulrich Kühn of the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information , who 's name sounds like Metallica 's drummer joined The Starship Enterprise , also confirmed Facebook is on the level . He said : `` We wanted to be very sure this was done , so we took our time to be really sure . '' He was sure . Despite Facebook abandoning the feature in the EU , the row is still rumbling on in the United States . Facebook briefly suspended the feature late last year , only to reinstate it last week . Surely this has to be Obama 's fault ?

Facebook may have more than a billion users , but quite a few of them are n't sticking around , according to a study . 42 per cent of 18 to 29-year-olds and 34 per cent of 30 to 49-year-olds are spending less time on the social network than a year ago , the Pew Research Centre 's Internet & American Life Project says . Furthermore , 61 per cent of current users say they 've taken weeks-long breaks from the social network , and 20 per cent have stopped using it altogether . So why are they falling out with it ? Of those who took a break , 21 per cent said they were too busy or did n't have time to keep up with an online social life . 10 per cent said they were n't interested or just did n't like it , and another 10 per cent described Facebook as a waste of time or irrelevant . The anecdotal reasons hint at people tiring of social networking in general . They include : `` I was tired of stupid comments '' ; `` I took a break when it got boring '' ; `` You get burned out after a while '' and `` People were [ posting ] what they had for dinner . '' Not that Facebook should be too worried . The study shows 69 per cent of American adults who are online ( which is more than half the entire adult population of the US ) use a social network , with Facebook by far the most popular . And most people in the study plan to use the social network just as much in the next year . Are you over Facebook ? Let us know in the comments below . Via Pew

Facebook stalking could take on a whole new meaning if reports prove true that the social media giant is developing its own user location tracking app . According to a Bloomberg report , Facebook is developing a location tracking app for smartphones that would help users keep tabs on where their friends were at all times . Facebook already has a feature called Places as part of its mobile app , which lets users check into locations similar to Foursquare , but the new app would go a step further . One of Bloomberg 's sources noted that the app would remain active even while not in use , similar to Apple 's Find My Friends feature , to keep track of location data at all times rather than just when someone checks in . The proposed app raises several privacy concerns , among which is the relationship between location data and advertisers . According to Facebook 's data use policy , `` We may put together your current city with GPS and other location information we have about you to , for example , tell you and your friends about people or events nearby , or offer deals to you that you might be interested in . We may also put together data about you to serve you ads that might be more relevant to you . '' While this is already part of Facebook 's data use policy , the prospect of having it come into play while a user 's location is under constant surveillance raises concerns . It 's also possible that since this is already a policy that all Facebook users agree to , a location tracking app may not need to ask for additional permission before keeping tabs on user whereabouts . While Facebook may become more transparent about tracking user locations in the new app , it is also becoming more transparent with how its ads are tracking users . Facebook ads based on browsing history are nothing new , but a recent agreement with the Council of Better Business Bureau mandates that those ads must notify users that they use tracked user information . Of course , the way in which notifications appear is fairly obtuse . When clicking on the `` x '' icon to close a Facebook ad , the dropdown menu will now display an AdChoices icon to indicate that it appeared based on browsing data tracked by the ad . The icon will take users to a page where they can opt out of future ad tracking , though the process will have to be done with each individual advertiser that appears , and there are dozens of them . It may take a while for the policy to go into effect though , as the agreement outlines that notifications should be up and running by the end of the first quarter in March .

One billion users ca n't be wrong . A seventh of the world 's population is connected by a single website – one that 's existed for less than a decade - and that number is expected to double in the next five years . Facebook , like it or not , is ubiquitous . If you 're not connected - if you 're not part of it - then you 'll miss out on crucial social interactions . Parties will pass you by . Birthdays will come and go . You 'll have no idea that one friend in particular had some spectacular meatballs for tea last night , and you wo n't be able to tag a snap of your cheese on toast for your chums to see in return . What would life be without connectivity like that ? Facebook does everything it can to make sure everyone gets access to its service . In developing countries in Africa , for example , owners of basic mobile phones can connect to the service using Facebook Zero , a no-frills , no-graphics WAP version that does n't incur data charges . As company co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg pours his efforts into expansion in Asia and South America , Facebook looks set to cement its position as a true worldwide phenomenon . On your iOS device , Facebook really comes alive . You can take a picture and post it online in seconds , keep up with conversations using Push messages , and manage pages and groups ; everyone 's experience is different , but you should be able to do everything crucial through the iOS apps without straying towards the web interface any more than is strictly necessary . Let 's explore Facebook on iOS , see what we can and ca n't do , and find out how you can be more connected than ever before thanks to your Apple device . You ca n't abandon the core web interface altogether , though . Facebook 's iOS incarnations miss a few features that very occasionally necessitate the odd trip into Safari , like sharing and managing friends lists . All in all though , the app is a 95 % complete Facebook experience , and one you 'll come to enjoy more than the web based version because of its sheer speed and portability . Here 's where everything is . We hope you enjoy your stay . Here you can give everyone a quick update , telling them something you 've been up to , something you 've seen , or even how you 're feeling - but we 'd lay off the emotional stuff if we were you . Part of using Facebook is not irritating your friends . At the bottom of the compose screen you 'll see icons that let you tag people you 're with , add your location , attach a photo , and say who can see your post . If someone has sought you out and asked to be your friend , you 'll see their request here and you can either confirm it or say 'Not now ' to politely and invisibly decline it . Scroll down a little and you 'll see Facebook 's suggestions of people you might know . Tap their picture to see a bit more about them , as some people use pseudonyms on Facebook ( although , technically , you 're not supposed to ) . It 's possible to exchange private messages with people on Facebook . If someone has sent you a new missive , you 'll find it here , and you can send a reply by typing in the box at the bottom . You can also start a new conversation with someone by tapping the pencil icon and typing the recipient 's name ; a list of possible matches will pop up , so you can pick exactly the right one . Has someone said something public about you , mentioned you in a status update , or maybe tagged you in a photograph ? You 'll find out about it here . This is also where event invitations and replies to posts you 've commented on will appear .

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has claimed that his company is n't on speaking terms with Google anymore . During the company 's quarterly earnings call late last week , Zuckerberg spoke of the Silicon Valley playground spat , which has left the web giants on opposing teams . He said : `` Our relationship with Google is n't one where the companies really talk . '' Now , this could mean that Facebook and Google do n't really have any reason to talk , but given Facey 's desperate need to own the mobile space , part occupied by Google , everyone knows that is n't true . So what 's caused the rift ? Well , Facebook launching a competing Graph Search engine , allowing users to search for connections between people , places , photos , events and more , ca n't have helped matters . Also , Google CEO Larry Page slamming the social network for `` doing a really bad job on their products '' would certainly be enough for Facebook to get the hump . To juxtapose the situation nicely , Zuckerberg claimed he was `` really happy with the partnership '' Facebook is enjoying with Google 's arch-nemesis Apple . We 're not saying Facebook is picking sides , but if Google and Apple were having a sleepover on the same night , we all know where Zuckerberg would be taking his sleeping bag and scary movie collection ...

Update 12:30 p.m. PDT Friday : Facebook may have a sprung a pretty large leak with all the information that 's come out about its April 4 event . Now The New York Times has jumped in , saying that yes , Facebook will show off its own version of the Android OS Thursday , one that will debut on an HTC handset . The Times , speaking with a Facebook employee and another person briefed on the announcement , backed up the Wall Street Journal 's report that Facebook will show up immediately on a user 's home screen as the phone turns on , but also added information that Facebook 's camera and messaging apps will be default apps for the phone 's core functions . Former Apple engineers who worked on the development of the iPhone are said to be part of the team working on Facebook 's mobile phone project . Update 9:30 a.m. PDT Friday : More evidence is mounting that Facebook intends to reveal an Android feature that deeply integrates the social network into a handset , specifically one from HTC . Sources speaking with the Wall Street Journal have told the publication that Facebook has been working on software for Android that displays content from a user 's account onto the home screen , making that information immediately available instead of users having to navigate to a dedicated Facebook app . The first phone to demo the feature will be from HTC , the Journal said ; however , the social network is also apparently looking for other device makers to partner with . It also plans to make the app available to all Android devices . In order for the app to work , manufacturers will have to tweak the Android software they deploy . Such changes reportedly do n't violate agreements manufacturers have made with Google . The idea behind the endeavor is to put `` Facebook first , '' one of the publication 's sources said , a move that the company hopes increases people 's time on Facebook and therefore leads to more ad revenue . Original article ... We 're beginning to think Facebook must really like having people come visit , or at least we gather that by the number of events the company has been hosting at its headquarters lately . Thursday the social network sent out media invites to `` come see our new home on Android '' during an event at 10 a.m. PDT April 4 , a few weeks after it unveiled its new News Feed and just a couple of months since we got our first look at Graph Search . This event promises to be quite different however , particularly as it 's focusing on mobile , and a specific system at that . What 's more , this could be more than just a run of the mill app revamp : We could be in for something worth sharing in a status update . Sources speaking with TechCrunch say the event will reveal a modified version of Android with heavy Facebook functionality baked into the home screen . What 's more , this retooled OS may be housed in an HTC handset . While not a complete rewrite , the OS is said to be a `` flavor '' of Android with extra Facebook spices included . Alternately , TechCrunch sources have heard the Facebook/Android mishmash referred to as an `` application layer , '' one that leans heavily on native Facebook apps like Messenger and includes convenient social sharing functionality from wherever users find themselves on the device . Yet another rumor calls the whole endeavor `` Facebook Home , '' the marquee feature of which will be a home screen that bears the markings of Facebook through and through . All of this bleeds into a report from 9to5Google intimating that Facebook and HTC are working on a joint advertising promo . AllThingsD meanwhile reported in 2011 that the two companies were breathlessly working with one another to build a deeply FB-integrated smartphone . What all this means is that we could indeed see a Facebook phone come to life next week ... or not . These are just rumors for now , so take all of the above with a hefty few shakes of salt . However , with the whole `` where there 's smoke , there 's fire '' credo , we could see something hardware related creep out of Menlo Park next Thursday . TechRadar will be at the Facebook 's event live to bring you all the latest , so tune back in for more on Facebook 's Android aspirations .

Paul Ceglia has been trying to convince courts in the US that he is entitled to half of Facebook for nearly three years , but a judge has now thrown his key evidence out of court . He 's been dogging Zuckerberg through the courts in pursuit of the 50 per cent of Facebook and its sizable mountain of cash that he thinks is rightfully his using a contract signed by Zuck as evidence . But its bad news for Ceglia as Judge Leslie Foschio has branded Ceglia 's contract a `` recently created fabrication '' . Facebook is being a little less generous , with the company 's deputy general counsel Colin Stretch calling the lawsuit `` an inexcusable fraud based on forged documents '' . The lawsuit has been rumbling on for around three years , with Ceglia contending that he and Zuckerberg signed a contract while at Harvard which split the then unnamed Facebook company 50/50 . Facebook says there was a contract , but that it was nothing to do with the product that ended up being known as Facebook . The judge 's lengthy decision took in chemical , handwriting and printing analysis on the contract to try and determine its authenticity , with the investigators concluding that it all seemed pretty dodgy . However , not one to be knocked by setbacks , Ceglia 's lawyers say he may yet appeal . He 's really gunning for that The Social Network sequel , is n't he ?

At GDC 2013 , Facebook hit share on its latest success story : Its games are a now $ 2 billion business . This finds the blue-bordered social network eager to expand its role as a gaming platform across mobile and desktop devices . That 's the point it hammered home at its Facebook Developer Day today at GDC in San Francisco . After putting out a call to action to the Game Developers Conference crowd , it hopes attendees wo n't forget that its still has a strong online gaming presence . According to Games Partnership Director Sean Ryan , Facebook wants all the genres including `` MOBAs , FPSs , RTSs , RPGs , any other acronym you can think of . '' Whatever kind of game people want to play with their friends , Facebook wants to host it . `` Our desktop business is healthy and growing , '' said Ryan , who had the numbers to back him up . A slide show touted 250 million monthly users playing games , with $ 2 billion dollars paid out to developers last year . According to Facebook 's statistic , more than 100 were paid a million dollars in 2012 . The go-to success story is Candy Crush Saga , a puzzle game that 's `` crushing the competition '' in the iTunes App Store and Google Play . With Facebook playing the role of `` identity provider , '' players get a seamless experience , allowing them to jump from desktop to mobile with out losing a millimeter of progress . What 's more , as of February 55 percent of top 400 iOS apps use a Facebook login . Obviously , Facebook games are a business , and as we know , a business must grow . But in order to properly do so , Ryan says titles must achieve the right balance of `` virality and effectiveness . '' Basically , games need to be able to promote themselves without totally annoying users . That was a point that Growth and Revenue Product Manager George Lee focused on . He referred to early 2011 the `` dark days of Facebook gaming . '' In response to user friction over notification spam , changes to the Facebook News Feed had crippled games engagement . Developers were beginning to doubt Facebook 's commitment to gaming . Staring down the potential kneecapping of a hot revenue source , Facebook put a team together , the Facebook Games Team . They were tasked with adapting a `` platform [ that ] was never built for games , '' Lee explained . The answer became app recommendations , among other things , but the team 's crowning achievement was a banner for games published on Facebook 's homepage . Lee stressed that publishing to the homepage was something that , `` Mark Zuckerberg does n't let us do very often . '' After that $ 2 billion bumper year in 2012 , Facebook is now hungry for new titles , new developers and new genres , seeking developer engagement the way its games crave user engagement . In addition to `` recruiting across the board for games , '' Facebook says the new , more visual News Feed will make it easier for games to succeed . Only time will tell whether Facebook gaming has plateaued or can continue to rise , but with Facebook now taking a more active role in encouraging gaming development , more titles are certainly on the way . Hopefully , it wo n't mean the return of updates about artificial farm animals , and digital mafias .

The HTC Myst , widely believed to be the next Facebook smartphone , looks as if it 's headed to the AT & T network , according to a recently unearthed Federal Communications Commission filing . The FCC documents name the company as HTC and the device as PM33100 , a model number that 's previously been tagged as the HTC Myst and HTC Opera before that . What 's even more interesting is that the four LTE frequencies listed in the equipment test portion of the report are normally found in AT & T smartphones , concluded Engadget . HTC , AT & T and Facebook have n't responded to TechRadar 's inquiries into the FCC filing , but we 'll let you know if and when they do . The HTC Myst specs are still shrouded in obscurity , as the FCC report does n't reveal any more facts about the forthcoming handset . However , previous rumors indicate this HTC phone may run Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean and have a 4.3-inch screen with a 720p display at 320ppi pixel density . Better yet , a 1.5GHz dual-core MSM8960 Snapdragon processor , 1GB RAM , and 16GB of internal storage should give HTC 's next Facebook phone the bump that it needs over its predecessors . HTC had previously released a pair of Facebook smartphones , the HTC ChaCha ( HTC Status in the U.S. ) and HTC Salsa , tied to the social network app , complete with a dedicated Facebook button . How well the HTC Myst plays with Facebook and whether it contains a dedicated button for the app remains to be seen . With the FCC filing squared away and the carrier most likely AT & T , the long-rumored HTC Myst Facebook should provide a proper official status update soon .

When the new Zynga.com rolls out next week , the rift between the casual gaming giant and its former BFF Facebook will widen ever so much further , leading us to believe that a messy breakup is n't exactly imminent , but certainly not far off . In a blog post published today , the folks at Zynga announced a few changes coming to their independent gaming portal , including one that lets users create their very own Zynga.com account . When users touch down on the Zynga.com homepage next week , instead of being directed to sign in via Facebook Connect , they 'll be able to log in using an exclusive account . Jumping on through FB will become an option , plus players will have freedom of choice if they want keep game friends and progress posted on Facebook . For Zynga , this is `` a national evolution '' for its site . For its relationship with Facebook , let 's just say it looks like Zynga is taking some `` me time '' to become its own social network . Blips are TechRadar 's new news nuggets that you 'll find percolating through the homepage - or you can see them all by hitting the blip keyword below .
Not content with its overly pally web-based status questions ( What 's on your mind , TechRadar ? What 's happening ? How 's it hanging ? ) , Facebook is trying out push notifications for iOS requesting that you update your status . `` Bijan , tell friends what 's on your mind , '' it suggests in the screengrab taken by one lucky Facebook user who 's in on the testing . Then , the rather more demanding suffix , `` Post an update . '' Jeez Facebook , we 'll post an update when we post an update . Stop trying to encourage us to spew more nonsense onto the internet . Hopefully this is one of the features bound for the great Facebook news feed in the sky .

Facebook revealed today that it began rolling out beta updates of its Android app to select users , bypassing the usual route of installing updates through the Google Play store . This is intended to allow a limited amount of users to experience new features through the silent updates before a wider release using Google Play , Facebook told TechRadar . The Android app 's first beta update lets users change their profile photo using their mobile device , and allows them to hide stories and report spam , discovered website Liliputing . `` The Facebook app beeps or vibrates incessantly until you install it , '' reports the site . The good news is that these select Android users are n't random guinea pigs . Facebook made it clear to TechRadar that the beta updates only occur if a user has allowed non-Google Play apps to be installed on their phone or tablet . Additionally , the Facebook Android app beta updates only happen over Wi-Fi and when users have initiated installation , the company noted . Facebook 's transition to rolling out updates to the Android platform echoes what it has been doing for years with its desktop component . The social networking site 's recently announced Graph Search and and new News Feed , for example , have n't been made available to everyone yet . The company has expressed a culture of moving fast , keeping true to that `` keep shipping '' mentality . Whether or not this is the first step for Facebook to break with official app stores remains to be seen , as does any signs of an often-denied , but often-rumored Facebook phone .

Facebook made a splash with its clean , photo-centric News Feed reveal last week and today the company revealed how it decided upon certain aspects of the refresh . The revamp , announced at a media event last Thursday , saw Facebook introduce dedicated feeds for friends ' posts , photos , music , games and more , in a bid to `` de-clutter '' the site 's landing page . In an interesting and detailed blog post , User Experience Researcher Jane Justice Leibrock explained how she was called in to respond to the needs of Facebook users who had demanded a cleaner experience . She found that the posts that users actually wanted to filter out were the ones they most commented on , which were `` page posts , stories about songs and games , and stories friends liked or commented on . '' This left the company with a challenge , she explained : `` Since people were clearly interested in these stories , our task became figuring out how to display them separately from News Feed , in a way that people would want to see them . `` We came up with the idea of multiple feeds , each with its own focus on a particular topic , type of content , or type of friend . '' From there , Leibrook asked participants in her study to assemble printed stories into assigned piles , depending on how they related to each other . This helped Facebook narrow down what those new and plentiful feeds within the redesign should be . She wrote : `` These themes from my sorting study went directly into the team 's decisions about which feeds to make available to people . A Photos feed had been a no-brainer from the start , and the idea of a Close Friends feed had been in the mix and got more traction based on the findings . But the creation of a Following feed was spurred by people 's desire for stories related to their interests . The All Friends feed was also born out of my research , which showed people were interested in serendipitous discovery of stories from their full friend lists . ''

Netflix announced a new way for US subscribers to get movie recommendations with Facebook integration . Users can now log into their Facebook account through Netflix , allowing them to find out more about what their friends are watching . Syncing Netflix and Facebook accounts will make two new lists appear on the Netflix Instant Watch page for `` Friends ' Favorites '' and `` Watched by your Friends . '' By default , Netflix history will only be shared through Netflix with other subscribers , though there will also be the option to share what you watch with friends on Facebook . Sharing can be further customized with a `` do not share '' button that will now appear as a TV show or movie begins to play , letting users opt out of sharing their more embarrassing viewing habits . Facebook integration is not exactly a new feature for Netflix , as users outside the US have had access to it for over a year . Social networking integration has not been previously possible in the US due to the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 , which made it illegal for a video service provider to reveal customer information without a written agreement signed by each user . The law was recently amended , after much lobbying by Netflix , which now allows users to opt in to share their viewing history through social networks . `` There are few better ways to find a movie or TV series you 'll love than hearing about it from your friends , '' said Netflix Vice President of Product Innovation Tom Willerer . `` Facebook already makes it easy for our international members to connect with friends over TV shows and movies and we 're thrilled to now bring this experience to our US members . '' Netflix is launching Facebook integration to US users starting today , with the feature rolling out to all users by the end of the week . Via HotHardware
If you 're a Facebook user who still has n't adjusted to Timeline view , the social network is introducing several design changes today in response to feedback from its members . Facebook announced Wednesday that it has started rolling out improvements to Timeline , the profile redesign it first introduced in late 2011 . First and foremost , the new Timeline layout is cleaner , a change the social network claims was implemented with the help of feedback from Facebook users . Instead of posts being spread across two columns , the improved Timeline now keeps everything on the right side of the screen , with photos , music and other activity separated at left . The cleaner Timeline also aims to make it easier for users to organize the interests represented on their About page with redesigned sections for apps . For example , movie lovers can use Flixster or Netflix to share what they 've been watching , while books can be added to their own section with a click of the Add button . For developers , Timeline now includes a new Open Graph tool to simplify the setup process , while making it easier to preview News Feed stories and configure sections . If you do n't see the updated Timeline on your own profile yet , do n't panic : Facebook claims the change is rolling out gradually to all users in the coming weeks .

Although HTC 's first attempt at a smartphone with dedicated Facebook button did n't take the world by storm , the Taiwanese manufacturer and its partners look ready to make a comeback with the more capable HTC Myst # UL . After releasing the ChaCha ( Status in the U.S. ) and Salsa in 2011 , UnwiredView reported Friday that HTC is preparing to take another stab at an Android smartphone centered around Facebook with a device known as the HTC Myst # UL - Myst for short . According to @ evleaks , a serially reliable source for the site , specs for the handset formerly known as the HTC Opera closely resemble those leaked in February , which revealed a 4.3-inch , 720p display with 320ppi pixel density . One big improvement appears to be a step up to a 1.5GHz dual-core MSM8960 processor , along with 1GB RAM and 16GB internal storage - although in this case , it wo n't be expandable via microSD . With a release anticipated for the spring , the HTC Myst reportedly will arrive powered by Android 4.1.2 : Jelly Bean and a full slate of baked in Facebook software . That lineup is said to include a new version of the official Facebook app , Facebook Messenger and the company 's Instagram for social photo sharing . To help Facebook users share their lives with others , the HTC Myst # UL includes both 5MP rear-facing and 1.6MP front-facing cameras , Bluetooth 4.0 , 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi and will come ready for LTE and HSPA networks . The phone is seemingly set to arrive at AT & T in the States come spring , but we 'll also keep our ears open for whether we can expect an international incarnation of the second-gen social phone to arrive .
So Facebook 's fiddled with its news feed again and this time it 's all about simplifying your Facebook experience , it says . Not ads . Do n't worry about the ads . You do n't need to think about ads . It 's certainly a cleaner look than the last newsfeed iteration , and brings the web experience more in line with the iPad and iPhone apps . Like Spotify 's new Web Player , Facebook has concentrated on vertical columns to separate all its social bits and pieces . The menu options are banished to a darkened column on the left hand side - it 's a responsive design , so when screen space is at a premium it shrinks down to just icons , and expands out to full titles when there 's more room to breathe . The News Feed itself takes up the bulk of the main middle column while the right hand column plays host to some filtering options and , of course , some ads . Although the News Feed is displayed by default every time you open Facebook , the column on the right gives you greater control over what you see . You can choose to see updates from all friends ( which seems to include friends you 've hidden or requested only important updates from ) , updates from people and publications you follow but are n't friends with . With the emphasis on pleasing visuals , it 's no surprise that you can choose to see only photo stories by hitting Photos . And with social gaming a good source of revenue for Facebook , another key tab is Games where you can spy on what games your pals are playing ( no Farmville in mine , I 'm happy to report ) . The Music tab is pretty cool - not only does it serve up all the musical activity your friends are engaging in , from liking Beyonce to listening to stuff on Spotify , it also suggests artists you might want to 'Like ' ( based on friends ' preferences and your own existing likes ) as well as suggesting upcoming concerts that you might be into . This suggested Likes thing is prevalent around the new design , and it 's probably because Facebook wants you to like as much as possible so it can target ads more effectively at you - and make its Graph Search product a mite more useful . Facebook tells us that this filtering menu will learn which options you go for most frequently and reorder itself accordingly . The news ticker is relegated to a tiny corner of the site and it does n't look as though you can increase the size of it which is a shame - although the general News Feed includes some of this activity , it 's making stalking some of my friends a lot more difficult . And this is an issue : as my esteemed colleague Gary Marshall points out , this brave new world does not provide a very sociable experience . This emphasis on visuals takes the attention away from the words you might use - so it makes us less inclined to post status updates , for instance , because a photo will look better and be seen more . This is something Facebook loves - it does n't want you to comment so much as Like - your friend 's cat died ? Like . Your aunt grows a whole new person in her tummy ? Like . Funny sign ? Like . It does n't want you to share , it wants you to curate . You want to communicate with people ? Take it to the messages app . Take it to Facebook chat . But your news feed is now only for News with a capital N - and that 's a real shame . Even the Following view shows posts from pages you do n't actually follow - I do n't follow the NME , yet because two of my friends do , Facebook thinks it 's okay to show me its updates :
I can tell what website my wife is using by listening . If all I can here is the tapping of her fingers , she 's in webmail . If I can hear the scrolling of a mouse wheel , she 's on the message boards . And if she 's using language that would make a sailor blush , she 's on Facebook . I ca n't imagine what words she 'll use when she gets the redesigned Facebook News Feed . It does n't look like a big deal - it takes the existing layout and makes it prettier - but it actually represents quite a big change . Facebook is making itself more annoying and less useful . If you 're using the Facebook mobile apps you 'll have some idea of what to expect : enormous adverts that take over the entire screen and an increasingly erratic selection from your friends ' updates . You 'll also get exciting new tabs to see only specific kinds of content , such as music , and much more emphasis on photography . That 's great news for the millions of Facebook users who 've been demanding more late-night drunken music video nostalgia-fests from people with terrible taste in music and more pictures of people 's dinners , pets and children . The big change is a philosophical one , though . Facebook does n't want to be a noticeboard , a place where everybody posts everything and you then decide what 's relevant and hide everybody who 's annoying . It wants to be Flipboard . As Dustin Curtis , creator of Svbtle.com , put it on Twitter : `` Facebook 's new layout marks a massive change in its design philosophy . It has gone from being a 'social utility ' to a 'social magazine ' . '' It 's not a place to communicate any more . It 's a place to discover content . In order to monetise its millions , Facebook is changing its focus from `` what are you doing ? '' to `` what content are you consuming ? '' Do n't take my word for it . Here 's Zuck : `` This gives people more power to dig deeper into the topics they care about . '' The Associated Press reports that `` Zuckerberg hopes to turn the News Feed into something more like a newspaper tailored to the particular interests of each of the social network 's more than 1 billion worldwide users . '' It 's an interesting move , and I 've no idea how successful it 'll be - the only photos I 'd like added to my News Feed would be of Zuckerberg being chased through jaggy bushes by angry bears , so I 'm probably not the target audience for any of this - but clearly , Facebook is going to be that bit more annoying and less useful for those of us who already have Flipboard and Zite and RSS feeds and Google to dig deeper into the topics we care about . I can tell you one thing , though . When my wife gets it , she 's going to go ballistic .

Facebook likes photos , or rather Facebook users like photos . At least , we surmise that from the social networks new look for the News Feed . But does the wonderful world of Twitter like Facebook 's new News Feed , which Thursday got a refreshed design anchored on oversized images and cuts the clutter of the old chrome look ? The web consensus is so far edging on the positive , though there 's a hearty helping of comparisons floating around . `` Some really well thought out changes to Facebook # newsfeed ! # design '' @ Glennengler wrote , while @ LilFrogPrince plainly said , `` And yes , the new Facebook Newsfeed looks like Google+ to me . '' @ andrewmaddox also took a Google+ copycat take . `` The new # facebook # newsfeed -- looks like Google+ ... Oh , but there are people using it , so maybe it 's G+ that will be used . '' While some Twitter members called the new look great , others say its a flag in the sand of an era where website design more completely takes its cue from apps . There 's a smattering of cynicism rolling about too . `` BREAKING : Facebook 's new # newsfeed will now feature LARGER pictures of babies , puppies , and food , '' barked @ thepaulmeyers . `` Does Zuckerberg think we 're all far-sighted wit this new # newsfeed ? '' quipped @ kramberryjuice , referring of course to Facebook 's CEO Mark Zuckerberg . A number of social media users expressed some apprehension about what this means for advertisements moving forward , particularly since Zuck and Friends skirted during Thursday 's press conference . Ads will no doubt follow the new News Feed design ethos , meaning we are in for larger-imaged marketing efforts candy coated with visual appeal . While they may feel more organic , a pretty picture does n't make advertisements any easier to swallow for many users . A report by Inside Facebook found that there will be a prominent hide button on ads as part of the redesign to start , though what the button does exactly is for the moment unclear . Sidebar ads , it also appears , are n't leaving with the new look . What 's your take on the new News Feed ? Love it , hate it , or reserving judgment until a full rollout gets underway ? Let us know in the comments below . We love to hear what you think .
Facebook today introduced a new look for News Feed , one that reflects the `` evolving face '' of the service , said hoodie jacket-clad CEO Mark Zuckerberg . The new News Feed is chopped down , with photos popping off the page and user `` stories '' front and center . The aim , the FB team noted , is to highlight exactly what it is that people want to share by pushing forward content and letting the rest fade . The new design is for both desktop and mobile , bringing a uniform look to the Facebook experience on every platform . As Facebook 's Chris Cox said , the idea behind the News Feed redesign is to try to move Facebook out of the way as much as possible , pushing user content to the front and pull back the chrome we 've all learned to live with . The bread and butter elements of the News Feed - photo albums , status updates , new connection alerts and liking Pages - have all gotten touch up . Cover photos , for example , find themselves behind a profile picture when a connection becomes friends with another Facebooker . Photos albums , Pages and shared and liked articles from news sources are also getting some new-look love . Logos of publications like the Washington Post will appear next to articles published on Facebook , while articles , attachments and albums created by friends are afforded the chance to shine , Facebook Director of Design Julie Zhuo said . This new look , Facebook 's announcement squad said , is consistent across all platforms - smartphones , tablets , laptops and desktops - yet mobile is the muse for the look . The idea was to bring the look of mobile to the PC , timely as more users come to Facebook through their mobile devices . The various feed filters the company introduced today are consistent throughout all platforms as well . One intriguing addition is the ability to hover over a profile picture of users who 've commented on or liked a News Feed feature , such as a video . Those profile pictures , by the way , are now situated on the left hand side of the plus-sized image . Hovering will populate what that person specifically wrote below the image , a dynamic way to see the snarky or sweet comments left by connections . The new News Feed will start rolling out on the web today , while it will take a few weeks to get to mobile . Facebook will be deliberate in its roll out - starting with a small number of users , getting feedback and then sprinkling the revamped News Feed out to more users . You can sign up to join the wait list now .
Various Facebook employees , including CEO Mark Zuckerberg , took the stage Thursday to introduce another redesign for Facebook 's News Feed . Prominent among the new features is a series of separate News Feeds filters that present specific types of content . These News Feed sections include feeds for Music , Photos and Games , as well as new types of feeds called Most Recent , Following , Close friends , and All Friends . The sections will drastically change how users view content on Facebook . Users can jump to any different feed using the feed switcher located at the top of the News Feed . Notably for old school Facebook users , the new All Friends feed will simply display all of your friends ' updates in chronological order . That 's how the News Feed used to work , and no doubt some users will appreciate the comeback . `` We really heard from people that they wanted more choice and more control over the stories that they see on their News Feed , '' said Chris Struhar , Tech Lead of News Feed . For users who want to see all the music or photos that their friends and liked pages are displaying , those sections will do just that . The Music feed displays concert events , music news and photos , and the songs that friends have posted about , while the photos feed shows you every single photo your friends and pages publish . The Following feed displays all the posts from the public figures and pages that you like . Like the All Friends post , this feed is in chronological order , as well . Other feeds , like Close and Games , have been adapted from existing features and will remain largely the same . The disparate feeds will be sorted automatically based on how much you use them . The new Facebook News Feed redesign will begin rolling out to a small percentage of users on the web today and on mobile devices in the coming weeks , with an all-encompassing release to follow .

Not to be forgotten , Google updated Google+ profiles and pages with some improvements on Wednesday , one day ahead of an event at which Facebook plans to unveil a new look for the News Feed . Google+ Product Manager Sara McKinley broke down the updates straight on the social networking service itself , saying the improvements were user prompted . `` We spend lots of time listening to your feedback , and today we 're launching some profile and page updates that you 've been asking for , '' McKinley wrote . The changes added to Google+ include larger cover photos , a new profile tab , and easier info editing . The cover photos at the tops of users ' profiles are now several times the size they were before , coming in at up to 2120 x 1192 with a new aspect ratio of 16 x 9 . `` This way , more images can be used as cover photos , '' McKinley explained , `` and there 's more room for your selection to shine . '' In addition , a new tab for Local reviews has been added to users ' profiles , though users can choose to hide the tab if they want to keep their reviews private . And finally it 's easier for users to edit their info , as the `` About '' page has been compartmentalized into separate sections with their own `` edit '' links . Google+ has been playing catch-up to Facebook since day one , and the latest update brings it further up to speed while adding some flavor all its own . Google recently added app Sign-In and Google+ Communities , echoing similar features already available to Facebook users . In January , Google 's social network reportedly leapt past Twitter and Youtube in monthly active users , though the inexact nature of those statistics also raised some doubts . Now Facebook is preparing to unveil a News Feed redesign that could feature larger photos , new image-based ads , revamped feeds for photos and music , and new ways to navigate and search , at least according to TechCrunch sources . Wednesday 's Google+ update is rolling out `` gradually '' and should be available to all users soon . We 'll see how the changes stack up with what Facebook has in store tomorrow . It could make for an interesting battle of the social sites .

Vint Cerf , one of the founding fathers of the internet , has professed his disdain for Facebook , saying that you should have the option to use a pseudonym if you want . What a surprise , given that Vint Cerf is a senior executive and Chief Internet Evangelist at Facebook 's newest arch-enemy , Google . This sudden penchant for pseudonyms may seem a little hypocritical to anyone who remembers the hoo-hah Google+ faced when it originally banned people for using names other than their given ones . `` Using real names is useful , '' he said . `` But I do n't think it should be forced on people , and I do n't think we do . '' `` Anonymity and pseudonymity are perfectly reasonable under some situations . But there are cases where in the transactions both parties really need to know who are we talking to . `` So what I 'm looking for is not that we shut down anonymity but rather that we offer an option when needed that can strongly authenticate who the parties are . '' `` There was a debate on this subject and it was resolved . Our conclusion was that choice is important . '' Cerf went on to talk briefly about his lacklustre relationship with Facebook , saying , `` I 'm on Facebook and I found it less than useful . '' This lack of use seems to be down to Facebook 's friend limit of 5,000 friends , which Cerf says he hit too quickly - total humble brag . `` I complained to Sheryl Sandberg [ at Facebook ] that I thought that was a personal insult that they thought I had too many friends , '' he added . `` I think they changed it for me .

Remember in the 'Rocky ' movies when the fabled Italian Stallion heads off to train outside of his Philadelphia comfort zone to find the inspiration necessary to overcome a terrifying , iron-fisted foe ? Well that 's sort of what Facebook is doing with its engineers to help them obtain the mobile `` Eye of the Tiger '' - except it is n't shipping coders to the mean streets of Chicago or an icy Russian log cabin to do so . Rather , it has been revealed that developers at the social network are spending five days of intensive training with The Big Nerd Ranch , tuning their focus on creating new and exciting iPhone and Android apps . Facebook 's Director of Mobile Engineering Mike Shaver told Engadget that 450 employees have already completed the training as part of the company 's shift from a web-centric to a mobile first enterprise . Once the training - which is open to all Facebook employees , not just engineers - is complete , graduates can `` start writing code for apps the very next Monday , '' Shaver said . Engadget reports that designers , product managers and recruiters are among the Palo Alto natives to have completed the scheme , since it began last July , as the company bids to instill `` mobile empathy '' in its troops . Facebook 's laser-focus on mobile has been well documented in the last year or so , as access to the service via smartphones and tablets has overtaken traditional browser use . The company has yet to master the art of making money ( or as much money ) from its mobile offerings and , with shareholders to please , that needs to change sooner rather than later .

Ready for a News Feed redesign ? Facebook apparently is . The company is holding an event next Thursday , March 7 at 10 a.m. PST in its Menlo Park , Calif. headquarters , with invites plopping in press email inboxes today . The FB team is n't leaving anything up to guesswork : `` Come see a new look for News Feed , '' the invite , colored in signature Facebook blue , reads . The last time Facebook held an event , it was Jan. 15 . We were introduced to Graph Search , its own search tool to whittle down results of people , photos , places and interests based on exactly what users are looking to find . The announcement fell short of just about everyone 's expectations - rumors flew we 'd see a phone , a mobile OS , something other than an inner-Facebook search tool . While a News Feed redesign is n't necessarily an Earth shattering happening , it promises to be more exciting than Graph Search . An overhaul could not only change the way we experience Facebook on an interface level , it could have implications for how advertisements are delivered to us . A few sites , including ReadWrite , reported Thursday that the social network is testing a new Timeline design on users in New Zealand . As you can see the changes are subtle , yet noticeable : the status box within the profile page is shifted to the right , there 's a single-stream Timeline scroll also to the right , and the header bar has taken a trimming . Granted , this is talk about the Timeline and not News Feed , but perhaps we 'll see a link built between the two next week . Lastly , as mobile becomes the prominent avenue through which most users come to Facebook , we could see a stronger stamp of mobile come to the News Feed , especially on a revamped app . Last month , TechCrunch reported on an employee-only iOS app redesign of Facebook 's mobile News Feed . The hallmark of the change was full-screen photo tiles and overlaid text , dumping the blue and white most of us have grown accustomed to . Perhaps we 'll see something similar flushed out on the laptop and desktop versions ? Stay tuned to TechRadar for what your News Feed ( and maybe more ) will look like after March 7 .
Stalking your friends on Facebook , or `` getting to know them better , '' is becoming even easier as the social network 's new Graph Search proceeds through beta . It 's a powerful , visually based search engine that helps users sift through the chaos of Facebook to find the photos , people and info the network has to offer with a myriad of ways to filter results . Facebook debuted Graph Search last month . Though only a fraction of users have access to the beta , `` hundreds of thousands of people '' are taking advantage of the tool , according to a recent news post on the social site . Though the feature is still young , the Facebook staff seems pretty excited about it . They have even updated us on the top ways people are using the new tool with a few suggestions of fun search quires . People are chiefly using Graph Search as a way of `` finding out more about friends . '' The new search has a lot of ways it can filter your friends list . It can produce results by typing quires like `` My friends who are engaged '' or `` Photos of my friends before 2009 . '' The staff even suggests you figure out how many of your cohorts are Kevin Bacon fans . People are also using the search tool to sift through the millions of photos on Facebook . It can be used to find pictures from the New York Times or National Geographic . Users can also search by subject like the Baltimore Ravens or underwater photography . Third on the list of popular uses is as a trip planner . FB 's post noted people are using the Graph Search to plan vacation activities by looking for Museums or ski resorts their friends have visited . Facebook said it can also be used to find `` Places that people named 'Waldo ' have been to . '' Lastly , people are using the feature to `` discover new things '' about products or movies that friends enjoy . Examples include `` movies liked by people who like my favorite movies , '' or `` Favorite hobbies of CE.s . '' The search example help illustrate the power of the new engine and all the different queries it can handle . And if Graph Search can really locate Waldo , it 's a true miracle of modern science . Facebook has yet to share when the search tool will go public , but it might be a while . `` The roll out is going to be slow so we can see how people use Graph Search and make improvements , '' Ana Brekalo , a Facebook press rep told TechRadar . But if you want to keep an eye on its progress and maybe get in on the beta , you can sign up for the waiting list . And if you are still curious about it , check out our Graph Search first impressions . Until then , you 'll just have to find out things about your friends the old fashion way : by talking to them .

Facebook has today made a new version of its app for Windows Phone available , which gives users the opportunity to test new features before hitting the main app . The social network and Microsoft are inviting users to join its beta program for the new application , which brings several of the features most requested by users in an unrefined form . The beta app brings high-res photos and Facebook Timeline profile pages , giving the app an appearance more like the Android and iOS iterations rather than the 'Metro ' UI associated with Windows Phone . The hope is that users will send bug reports and feedback to enable the new features to graduate to the main Facebook for Windows Phone app in a more timely fashion . In a post on the official Windows Phone blog , Microsoft wrote : `` Today we 're launching a new program designed to help speed up delivery of new features in the official Facebook app for Windows Phone and need sharp-eyed , energetic volunteers to download a beta version of our next release and tell us how to make it better . '' However , the company warned : `` Do n't like it when apps crash ? This probably is n't the program for you . '' The good thing for Windows Phone users is that the existing app and the Beta app will sit alongside each other , so if users get too annoyed by the crashes , they can revert back to the main app . The beta app is not listed on the Windows Phone store ( Microsoft reckons it 'd cause confusion and it is probably right ) , but Windows Phone users can download the app by clicking this link .

At the launch of Facebook Home , Mark Zuckerberg made the announcement that 20 per cent of time spent on a smartphone is generally being spent browsing Facebook . Unfortunately , it does n't appear that Home is going to do much to increase that metric , with Android users panning the integrated app/launcher with one star reviews . Since it launched on the Play Store two weeks ago , Facebook 's Home app has been downloaded more than half a million times , and reviewed more than 14,000 times on Play . Strikingly , over 7,500 of those reviews only gave the service a single star out of five . Admittedly , 2,300 users rated it five stars , but when factoring in all the reviews , the app has an average rating of just 2.2 out of five . Far from being a death knell for the social network though , the Play store reviews do offer some level of hope for Zuckerberg 's mobile play . One of the overwhelming reasons for one star reviews is the fact that the integrated Facebook home screen experience sucks away battery life . The other obvious concern from user reviews is that the app goes too deep , making accessing non-Facebook content harder than it would otherwise be . Both of these issues can easily be fixed with some improved coding and future software updates , which should go a long way to keeping all those Facebook shareholders happy . The other good news for Facebook is that people seem to love Chat Heads . Although that might not be enough to keep them around once ads start arriving on the Home platform in future versions .

Google released another version of the Google Play Store app for Android today , and though it 's not a major facelift like the last update , it did bring one important change . The update included a policy change that will prevent apps from auto-updating . And guess which of Google 's competing social networks just added automatic updates that bypass the Google Play Store to its arsenal of tricks ? If you said , `` Facebook , '' you win nothing , because it was in the headline . But you 're still right . We asked Facebook representatives to share the social network 's take on the change , but they had no comment to share at this time . The new Google Play policy dictates that Android app updates must be released and administered through Google Play itself . `` An app downloaded from Google Play may not modify , replace or update its own APK binary code using any method other than Google Play 's update mechanism , '' reads an addition to Google Play 's developer program policies in today 's update . That new stipulation is nestled into a previously existing section called `` Dangerous Products , '' a label that could , from Google 's perspective as it continues to focus on its Google+ social network , be applied to Facebook . Google has been making an effort lately to add Google+ features that will help it compete with Facebook , like Google+ app sign-in and big , beautiful cover photos . Regarding today 's Google Play update , Google said the following in a statement to Engadget : `` Google Play is a trusted source for Android application downloads , and we are committed to providing a secure and consistent experience . '' Indeed , as the site pointed out , the slight against Facebook could be nothing more than a coincidence . Or maybe not .

You ca n't parade around as a fake Bastian Schweinsteiger on Facebook anymore , as the site 's right to terminate accounts that use pseudonyms has been upheld in German courts . This latest update in the back-and-forth battle over the social network 's controversial real name policy reaffirms two earlier decisions by lower courts . Facebook can really `` like '' the decision by the Administrative Court of Appeals of the State of Schleswig-Holstein this time around . It will be the final ruling , according to Susanne Rublack , a spokesperson for the appellate court who talked to PC World . At the heart of the case was whether or not German citizens had the right to online pseudonyms . This right is enshrined in German law , said to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner ( ULD ) for Schleswig-Holstein back in December . However , the data protection body 's case ran into trouble when Facebook challenged the decree on the grounds that its European headquarters is in Ireland . The court found that none of the social network 's data processing actually takes place in Germany , where Facebook houses only an ad sales and marketing team . With the the luck of the Irish , Mark Zuckerberg 's company escapes with a win in this third , and most likely final , challenge to Facebook 's real name policy .

After the giant hoopla over Facebook Home in the last couple of weeks , the company could be forgiven for thinking more than half 500,000 users would have downloaded it to see what all the fuss was about . Well apparently , folks are n't exactly rushing to the Google Play store to download the social network 's overbearing custom UI for Android , with only half a million downloads since the April 12 launch . The company reached the landmark on Sunday , according to the Google Play listing , which TechCrunch points out pales into comparison to the 5 million downloads , Instagram gained on Android in its first 6 days . However , there are extenuating circumstances for Facebook Home . So far it is only available on select Android devices , such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 , Galaxy Note 2 , HTC One X and HTC One X+ . Also international launches have been staggered , with the UK launch coming on April 16 . However , there 's no getting away from the fact that just 500,000 in 9 days is a poor return considering the hype that surrounded the launch . We figured that folks would at least be downloading it to give it a whirl , even if they deactivated it straight after . Perhaps things will pick up when the suite becomes more widely available on other Android devices ?

A Facebook exec has confirmed that the social network is 'talking ' to Apple about bringing Facebook Home to it 's famously locked-down iOS . That does n't mean that the part-OS part-overzealous-app will make it to your iPhone or iPad any time soon though , with Adam Mosseri , Facebook 's director of product , describing the talks as 'ongoing ' . `` We 've shown them what we 've built and we 're just in an ongoing conversation , '' he told the Bloomberg . Even if the talks prove fruitful , Mosseri is n't sure that what makes it to iPhone will look much like the Facebook Home the company launched last week - it could be more like Facebook Bedsit . `` It may or may not be Home . We could also just bring some of the design values to the iOS app . That might be how it ends up . Or we could build just the lock screen . Maybe then it 's not called Home , it 's called something else . '' Glad we cleared that up . His comments echo those of COO Sheryl Sandberg who told reporters , `` We are going to continue to develop for both [ Android and Apple ] . '' `` It is true that Android is enabling us to provide a more immersive Facebook experience than we can on other operating systems . Home is based on the openness of Android . It allows users to customise in ways that Apple does not . '' Given that Facebook Home for Android basically skims all the useful user data that can be used to target and sell advertising and Apple 's traditional unwillingness to share any of the data or revenue love with other companies ( take a bow , 30 % app store cut ) , we ca n't see an all-encompassing Facebook skin making it to iOS . Still , a 'lite ' version could well be on the cards , particularly since Chat Heads have already begun infiltrating the iOS apps .

Facebook floated the idea of building a brand new mobile operating system for its new Home platform , a senior company engineer revealed on Tuesday . The social network considered three ways to introduce Home ; a custom-built OS , a forked version of Android as many had expected , or the recently-launched custom UI that sits neatly on top of Android . Of course , the company went with the final option , but Facebook 's director of mobile engineering Cory Ondrejka admitted that prototypes existed for all three eventualities . He said : `` [ Home ] was about making an experience that flows through friends and people . We saw three ways that we could do this . One , we could go and build an operating system . Second , we could dig into Android deeply in order to see how we can we fundamentally change / fork Android to make it different . Or , we could build an app to make it different . '' Speaking at the D : Dive Into Mobile conference , Ondrejka said the first two options were ditched out of a desire to reach as many people as possible with Facebook Home . `` The OS path was the least fleshed-out of the paths . Mark [ Zuckerberg ] talked on launch day that he wanted to build something for everyone . It 's hard to get to the type of scale that 's necessary for us [ when building an OS ] . We wanted Home in front of hundreds of millions of people - even a successful OS would only give that experience to a few of them , '' Ondrejka , who was joined on stage by Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer , added . The pair also discussed the plans for future roll outs , admitting Facebook Home has been tested on tablets , but will not arrive until it becomes common place on all Android phones . They also revealed that the first Facebook Home update for Android is coming in May . Earlier today we brought news that the company was releasing the Facebook Home suite for select Android devices on Google Play stores around the world .
Facebook Home is coming to Google Play around the world later today , which means that anyone with a compatible handset will be able to download and install the Facebook-flavoured Android overlay . You 'll need an HTC One X , HTC One X+ , Samsung Galaxy S3 , Samsung Note 2 or HTC One to be able to make use of the free download . If that sounds like you , you can enjoy Facebook 's not-quite-an-OS which puts the social network front-and-centre on your handset . The app-but-not-an-app went live in the US on April 12 . The software turns your phone into a Facebook machine , putting Cover Feed on the homescreen with scrolling photos and status updates to enjoy without even unlocking your phone . Messaging is taken care of by the floaty-bouncy Chat Heads which pop up and glimmer at you when you have a chat running , until you flick them off screen . Although it takes over your phone entirely , you can still get at your non-Facebook apps thanks to Facebook Home 's app launcher . If you do n't have a compatible Android phone , never fear - you can still get annoyed with those persistent Chat Heads as they are now available in Messenger for Android . And now you can even get them on your iPhone too . Chat Heads . Inescapable .
Facebook 's bringing its multitasking Chat Heads to the Facebook iPhone and iPad apps . The floating friend heads are a key feature of Android 's Facebook Home interface , but since that 's not on its way to iOS any time soon Facebook has added them into the apps instead . You 'll be able to do other stuff on Facebook while chatting in private messages as the Chat Heads will hover across the top of your screen until you flick them down to close them . The social network is also making like it 's 1994 with new emoticon stickers that you can use in your chats - tapping the smiley in the text-input box lets you choose a sticker to post , while you can buy more from the Sticker Store if words fail you and that perfect emotion is n't represented in pictorial form . Finally , the iOS apps are also getting their mitts on the new-look Facebook News Feed in an update that puts the emphasis on bigger , more image-focused stories . The updated apps will be available from the App Store later today , while Chat Heads and Stickers will roll out to the iPhone app over the next few weeks . Android phones without Facebook Home can also get annoyed with the Chat Heads as they 're also available in Messenger for Android .

Subject to a seemingly endless barrage of criticisms over how it collects and presents information , including concerns over its new Facebook Home for Android , it 's no wonder Facebook is considered a dubious character when it comes to privacy . But the social network has now announced that it will be working with the National Association of Attorneys General in the US in an effort to promote privacy awareness to younger users . Facebook will release videos that answer questions about privacy and demonstrate how to manage your profile so you can make it as secure as possible . This is a big step forward for Facebook , which has been attacked time and time again over just how private our private data actually is . But it looks like the network wants to start painting a better image of itself , even though this does n't address problems of Facebook collecting users ' data . While its new campaign will be targeting teenagers specifically , there 's no denying that a lot of us could benefit from this . `` At Facebook , we work hard to make sure people understand how to control their information and stay safe online , '' said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in a statement . `` We 're grateful for Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler 's leadership on this issue , and we look forward to working with him and attorneys general around the country .

Social networking overlord Mark Zuckerberg has taken centre state in a relatively humorous new video promoting the merits of the new Facebook Home suite . In his acting debut , the Facebook CEO explains the importance of the launch to his employees , but they are n't really paying attention because , you guessed it , they 're too busy using Facebook Home . During Zuckerberg 's pep-talk one employee in particular is distracted by his pals ' squash match , go-karting and pool party shenanigans , while the now-infamous screaming goat also makes an appearance . Facebook released the viral video to celebrate the custom Android UI 's appearance on the Google Play store for select devices on Friday . Zuck 's performance has already gleaned good reviews with over 50,000 likes on the site , with 15,000 shares since it was posted late on Friday . The same ca n't exactly be said about Facebook Home itself though . As of Saturday morning , 48 per cent of all reviewers on the Google Play store had awarded the new interface just one star . Ouch . Via Venture Beat
On Friday Facebook Home arrived on the Google Play store , but only in the US and only on four devices , leaving the vast majority of Android users out in the cold . However , MoDaCo founder Paul O'Brien has offered a solution for curious social networkers by opening up the app for pretty much all Android devices , regardless of their location and the hardware they 're using . If you have an approved device like the Samsung Galaxy S3 , Galaxy Note 2 , HTC One X or One X+ then O'Brien has a patched version of the Facebook Home APK , which by-passes the location check . Those users simply have to enter their Android settings and allow for apps from untrusted sources to be installed , while ensuring they have the newest versions of the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps . For those not using the supported devices , things become a little more complicated , but the process will not require anything too strenuous . They 'll have to delete the official versions of the Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps and download O'Brien 's patched versions of those in order for Facebook Home to work . After that , simply `` sign in and in the Facebook application 's 'Settings ' menu the Facebook Home option should appear for you , '' O'Brien posted on the instructions page . The only folks that may have trouble with the mods may be those with handsets that have Facebook baked into the OS . Overcoming that obstacle would require rooting the device and removing the app yourself . Have you activated Facebook Home on an unsupported Android device ? Let us know how you get on in the comments section below .

Today may mark the first time users can download Facebook Home , but just because you do n't have the Galaxy S3 , One X+ , or any of the other select devices Home is available on to start does n't mean you have to miss out on one of the overlay 's marque features . Facebook updated Messenger for Android , imbuing the chat app with the wobbly bubble heads of your friends that follow you wherever you go on your phone . If you need a refresher , Chat Heads will pop up an image of whomever texts or messages you , and with a tap you can access the conversation . Multiple Chat Heads can populate your screen at once , while they 'll follow you into any application . To close a chat , simply swipe the bubble down and poof , conversation ended . Users with Android 2.2 phones and up should be able to access Chat Heads , so if you 're looking for a new way to manage your conversations without the hassle of downloading/waiting for Home , head over to the Play Store now .

Facebook has announced a major status update overhaul , allowing users in the U.S. to tag a range of specific activities within their posts . The social network wants users to share exactly what they 're reading , listening to , watching , eating and drinking and is also allowing users to pick an emotion to accompany status updates . From today , users can choose from one of the verb-centric categories and then begin typing the name of the product , book , movie etc . If that item has a Facebook page , the tag will link out to it . The 'feeling ' section of the new 'What are you doing ? ' section will serve up the long-rumoured emoticons , allowing users to state when they 're feeling happy , sad , safe , etc . Items tagged within status updates , like movies , TV shows and books , will be added to the relevant section of the user 's Facebook Timeline . For example if users tag Jurassic Park then it 'll appear within the watched movies section of the timeline . In terms of how the new status updates will work , we received the update a short while ago and it appears that users are only able to apply one action per status update . For example , users can say they 're watching 'Jurassic Park , ' eating pizza or feeling happy , but can not apply them all to the same status . Facebook said the update , which the company has been testing among a small sample of users since January , will take a few weeks to reach all users and will not affect existing privacy settings . The company 's blog post did n't announce a timeline for an international launch . TechRadar asked Facebook for comment and will update this story if a response is forthcoming . UPDATE : When asked about an international launch , Facebook spokesperson told TechRadar : `` Right now we 're focused on rolling out to more people in the U.S . ''

Facebook Home is set to be launch on the Google Play store on April 12 , but for those of you who really ca n't wait a second longer , a beta version has been leaked . The beta was published by MoDaCo , and interestingly the APK works on a range of Android handsets outside of those Facebook specified as compatible , which includes the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 7 tablet . The device does , however , need to have a maximum resolution of 1280x768 – and you need to be able to uninstall your current Facebook app too . As expected though , the beta leak does have limited functionality right now . Chat Heads is n't working , and as this is taken from a pre-release ROM , there are a few bugs in the mix . But the biggest thing we 're learned here is that Facebook Home has the potential to be put on a lot more devices down the line , which is pretty interesting in itself . But be warned - for those interested in grabbing the beta , MoDaCo warns `` you do so at your own risk '' .

The Facebook Home service will collect information about non-Facebook notifications and the applications users are opening , the company wrote in a blog post aimed at easing privacy concerns . In Friday 's post on the Newsroom blog , the company moved to assure users that their Facebook privacy settings will not be altered by the new custom Android UI , following vocal post-launch concerns . In a Q & A style post , Facebook said Home 's privacy controls are no different from the Android app and users ' current privacy settings will be carried over when they download the new custom skin . It also re-affirmed that users can ditch Facebook Home after the installation , simply by turning it off in the app 's settings . So far , so good , right ? However , If users do n't want Facebook knowing which other apps they 're using on their phone , Home most definitely is not for them . Home will collect data about the apps users are opening from its new Android launcher , but will not log information about what 's going on within those apps . The post wrote : `` Home will only see how you interact with Home itself . For example , Facebook could see that you launched a map application using the app launcher , but Facebook would not receive information about what directions you searched for or any other activity within the app itself . `` Of course , some apps already are Facebook-enabled so that you can share your activity within the app back to Facebook . This kind of integration existed long before we launched Home , and apps that have it will tell you if it is available . '' For handsets with Home pre-installed on the device , like the HTC First , the service will also collect data about which apps users are receiving notifications from , which it says will improve the service . The post added : `` For devices that come with Home preinstalled , Home can display system notifications , meaning that it will show notifications from apps on your phone . `` Since these notifications appear in Home , Facebook collects information about the notification ( such as which app is generating them ) but not the content of the notification itself . We remove identifying information from this data after 90 days . '' The company said location services act no differently in Home as they do in the regular Android app . So while Facebook Home is n't drinking down every activity on users ' handsets , there are valid concerns for folks that do n't want Facebook knowing more than it already does .

The new Facebook Home-optimised HTC First runs a stock version of Android Jelly Bean , which can be accessed simply by turning off the social network 's new , custom UI , the manufacturer confirmed on Friday . The Phandroid site discovered that those seeking to use Android in its purest form can , ironically , achieve this by buying a phone designed to almost completely hide the Google-built OS from view . In its hands-on time with the device , as did TechRadar 's in our hands-on review , Phandroid found that the Facebook Home skin can be completely disabled with one tap of the app 's settings menu . It also found that the Android notifications bar , missing from the core Facebook Home experience , could be summoned through the same setting application , while still using Facebook Home . HTC later confirmed to The Verge that this was indeed the case and stock Android is the beneath-the-surface version of the OS . Why is this somewhat of a surprise ? Well HTC phones are usually dripping in its own skin for Android , the love-it-or-hate-it Sense UI . In fact , it has n't launched a Sense-less Android phone since 2010 's T-Mobile G2 handset . Indeed , the company recently admitted it was `` very proud of Sense '' and wants it to ship on every device . Android fans are often seeking more handets with pure versions of the operating system , beyond the Nexus series , so the 'Facebook Phone ' could all of a sudden become an option for those folks . Check out the video below from around 6:30 .

Microsoft has applauded Facebook 's efforts to bring the 'people first ' experience Android is `` sadly lacking '' , with its Facebook Home UI , but said Windows Phone has been offering that for two years . Frank X. Shaw , Microsoft 's communications kingpin , said yesterday 's event was `` remarkably similar '' to the Windows Phone launch two years ago , when Microsoft unleashed its own people-centric OS . In a post on the official Microsoft blog , Shaw , who was complimentary of Facebook 's efforts , cheekily joked that he had to check his calendar to make sure it was n't 2011 when he tuned into coverage of the event . However , he also `` humbly suggested '' that Android users should n't bother adding Facebook Home to their phones when it is launched on April 12 , but should simply get `` the real deal '' Windows Phone instead . Shaw , Microsoft 's Corporate Vice President of Corporate Communications , wrote : `` When we sat down with a blank sheet of paper and designed Windows Phone , we put three words on the wall to guide the team : `` Put People First '' . `` People are more important than apps , so phones should be designed around you and the people you care about , not the apps you might use to reach them . So , we got to work and built a phone that asked and answered questions like these : `` Instead of rows and rows of apps , why not have a screen full of the people that matter most to you , and start with them ? Instead of having to launch an app to see what 's behind that notification icon , why not just bring the content to the home screen ? Instead of having SMS and Facebook Messaging as separate chat threads , why not bring them together in one conversation ? `` Instead of having photos on your phone and photos in Facebook , why not bring those photos together in one place ? Instead of having to launch an app just to check in , why not just tap your own face and do it directly ? '' Shaw went on to talk about how millions of Windows Phone users are already experiencing many of the benefits Facebook unveiled on Thursday and claimed Android users had become frustrated by the app-centric approach . He added : `` So , we understand why Facebook would want to find a way to bring similar functionality to a platform that is sadly lacking it . But as Android owners know , that platform is complicated enough without adding another skin built around another metaphor , on top of what is already a custom variant of the OS . `` So , while we applaud Facebook for working to give some Android owners a taste of what a `` people-centric '' phone can be like , we 'd humbly like to suggest that you get the real thing , and simply upgrade to a Windows Phone . ''
Technology is like fashion : by the time an exciting new range hits the shops , the industry 's eyes are already on the next big thing . This week , the next big things are coming from the biggest names in the business . If you were expecting this week 's big story to be the Facebook phone , you 'd be right , sort of : while the incoming HTC First Facebook phone is n't on a par with the HTC One or the Samsung Galaxy S4 , what 's really interesting is n't the hardware but the software - Facebook Home . By making a Facebook-flavoured interface for Android , Mark Zuckerberg 's mob is n't limited to just one phone . That means all kinds of Android phones could become Facebook phones , improving Facebook user engagement and driving Google crazy . Facebook knows its own limitations - and the power of an app . Facebook is n't the only tech giant showing off new software . Microsoft 's been at it too : Windows Blue is getting a duller name ( Windows 8.1 ) and a host of new features . And Apple is joining in as well . iOS 7 is running behind schedule , it seems , and engineers are being pulled off other projects to get it shipshape in time for this year 's WWDC . Despite early reports of `` pretty conservative '' changes , reports now suggest that Jonathan Ive is already putting his stamp on the iOS interface and that the changes will make iOS 7 look much fresher . Apple 's also involved in Webkit , the open source browser rendering engine spun off from KHTML , and this week we discovered that its Webkit partner Google does n't want to play any more . As Matt Swider reports , `` Google is kissing Webkit goodbye , announcing it will fork the widely used layout engine that renders web pages for its Chrome browser , and instead develop a new rendering engine , Blink . '' The move is apparently due to Google 's frustration that Webkit changes were n't happening quickly enough . Guess who else is getting into browsers ? That 's right : Samsung . In a move that raises many more questions than it answers , Mozilla and Samsung have announced that they 're collaborating on a new browser engine . As Michelle Fitzimmons reports , it 's interesting because `` Mozilla is working on its own mobile Firefox OS , while Samsung has been the standard-bearer - or at least most successful manufacturer - developing on Android . And of course there 's Tizen , an open source operating system Sammy has its fingers in . '' It 'll be interesting `` to see how the various pairings Samsung finds itself in end up playing out '' . We know what you 're thinking . `` Surely there must be some new and frankly unlikely Apple rumours this week ? '' - and you 're right , because the latest Apple TV speculation says that you 'll control the device with a magic ring . It 'll be a motion controller , and it will work just like a normal finger except something something magic ring . In a world of Kinect and Leap Motion interfaces , having to wear magic electronic jewellery to control a TV sounds like a backwards step to us . To say we 're sceptical would be an understatement . That 's not the only Apple rumour . This week we also heard that the Apple iWatch - which does n't officially exist - might have fingerprint scanning , just like the iPhone 5S , which does n't officially exist . The reports may well be accurate , but it 's worth noting that they 're based on single , anonymous sources . Some leaks are more credible , such as Gamespot 's comments on the Xbox 720 - it 's `` compelling '' and Microsoft is `` doing some really cool stuff '' - and the similarly named GameStop , who says that the PS4 will definitely be coming to Europe in 2013 , not 2014 as previously reported . But of course , this being the tech industry everybody 's already looking for what 's coming after that . So what 's next in high-end gaming ? According to Nvidia , it 's phones . They 'll be the new skinny jeans , mark our words .
Damn , that Mark Zuckerberg is smart . Facebook could have forked Android and tried to get manufacturers on board , but that would have been an enormous job - and a risky one too , because as Windows Phone 's disappointing numbers demonstrate , half-arsed support from OEMs is little better than no support at all . So rather than compete with Android , Facebook has decided to make it irrelevant instead with Facebook Home . On a typical Android phone , Facebook is just an app . Android runs the show and gathers all the data , and Facebook exists inside Google 's walled garden . On a phone with Facebook Home , Google 's the one in the garden and Facebook 's running the show . Facebook knows what apps you 're launching , and where you are , and what you 're doing , 24/7 . It 's an OS in everything but name , then , and because it 's an app Facebook can update it and push those updates to users as often as it likes . Nexuses aside , you ca n't do that with OS updates . Google must be furious . Facebook Home is n't for me , or for you : it 's not designed for people who worry about privacy , or who take smartphones seriously . It 's for the people who do n't care too much about tech , the people for whom Facebook and the internet are the same thing . You can see the appeal of an affordable , attractive Facebook Home phone - and Home is beautifully designed and very attractive - and for people already on Android it is n't hard to imagine the existing Facebook app plugging the hell out of Home until everyone installs it . What Facebook is doing , then , is trying to cut Google out of Google 's own OS - just like Amazon did with the Kindle Fire and perhaps its rumoured Kindle Phone , and just like Chinese manufacturers are doing with their cheap Android handsets . Google only benefits from Android if we use Google services , give Google data and watch Google ads . That does n't happen on Kindle Fires , or on Chinese cheapies , and if Zuckerberg gets his way it wo n't happen on HTCs or Samsungs either . The data will be gathered by Facebook . The ads will be Facebook ads . That might not happen , of course , but it 's a threat - and it 's a huge one . What Facebook is doing , I think , is using Google 's strength against it . The very openness that 's helped build market share gives Facebook a great opportunity to grab that huge audience , and the lack of control over Android apps means there 's no gatekeeper to stop it . Can you imagine Apple allowing this kind of takeover in iOS ? I 'm sure Google will be all smiles about Home today , but I 'm equally sure that behind the scenes , Mountain View is Frowny Face Central . Google is n't going to be happy about Home , and that means it 'll either try to copy it or kill it .
When Facebook introduced Facebook Home , its new overlay for Android today , Mark Zuckerberg and his presenting partners talked up its `` putting people , not apps first '' properties , like those `` delightful '' Chat Heads you can waggle around your home screen and apps . One thing they did n't talk about ( until asked ) was the always hovering topic of ads . The image-centric layout of Cover Feed seems primed to deliver marketing content in an attractive and more `` natural '' way . Surely Facebook is n't passing up the chance to make some mobile ad moolah ? Of course not , though it wo n't grab that golden ring right away . `` For v.1 , [ it ] does n't support a lot of types of stories that you can share on Facebook yet , including ads , '' Zuckerberg said . `` There are no ads in this yet , '' he continued . `` I 'm sure at some point there will be . '' To reiterate , that 's a `` yep '' on ads from Zuckerberg . That 's the curt answer he gave when asked to confirm that ads wo n't come to the Cover Feed at launch , but may at some point . There are a number of content types Facebook Home wo n't have when it launches on select devices April 12 . Besides ads , video cards , group joins and friending stories wo n't be displayed at launch . Over time , Zuckerberg said , more social media feeds could find their way into Cover Feed , which provides a constant stream of content and images within the home and lock screens . Users could one day see their Instagram , Pinterest , Tumblr and `` any other social service '' feeds stumble onto Cover Feed , avoiding a specific mention of Twitter . Since Facebook plans to update Home on a monthly basis , we 'll surely see more content feeds , including ads , come as time goes by . Facebook is going beyond a mobile first mentality to one of `` mobile best . '' The company said today it wants to make mobile the best way to experience the social network , which can only mean serving customers more richly in that space . It also means that advertisements must follow as Facebook , like all businesses , must make money . So for now , those who pick up an HTC First or download Home onto their Galaxy S3 , Galaxy S4 , HTC One , One X+ and the Galaxy Note 2 can enjoy an ad-free experience . Appreciate it while it lasts .
Facebook brought a recently rumored Android overlay to life today , the Facebook Home , along with the first handset to carry it , the appropriately named HTC First . Rather than making its own handset or forking Android to create an outright Facebook operating system , CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that as a Google Play download that 'll eventually be made available to most Android devices , Home can reach the maximum number of users . `` Our community has more than 1 billion people in it , '' he said . `` A really good phone would only get to one or 2 percent of that . '' That 's nice rhetoric , but the elephant in the Facebook press conference room was , `` What about Apple ? '' Again and again , Zuckerberg highlighted what he called the openness of Android , a feature that ultimately allowed Facebook to develop the Home overlay to fit on top of the operating system . He played the PR game , but his message about why Facebook went after Android and snubbed Apple 's iOS was clear : `` We have a great relationship with Apple , and the way you work on all these operating systems is pretty different , '' Zuckerberg hemmed during a post-conference Q & A . He did , however , get to the meat of the matter : `` Apple is a very controlled environment . The good news is we have this long , good relationship with Apple . We are integrated into the operating system , we have an active dialogue to do more with them , but ultimately anything that happens with Apple is through partnership with them . `` Google is aware of what we 're doing , we 've talked with them about this , but fundamentally Android is just a more open system , so we do n't have to work directly with them in order to build an experience like this or even go deeper than what we 're talking about today . `` They 've designed Android from the ground up to support deep integration like this . '' In other words , Apple 's closed and controlling environment was n't where Facebook wanted to develop Home . Apple , it would seem from Zuckerberg 's comments , would have had its fingerprints all over Home , slowing Facebook 's overlay roll and potentially taking the project far from the vision the FB team had when it set out to build this house of apps . Perhaps there 's an iHome in development already , but clearly Zuck and crew wanted to get Facebook Home out to the masses ASAP the way it wanted it to be done , and Android was the platform that allowed them to do it .

Facebook has unveiled an enhanced experience for Android , taking things beyond the standard Facebook app . Facebook Home essentially acts like an overlay for Android phones . Among other things , it replaces the lock screen and the home screen of your Android phone with the Facebook 'Cover Feed ' . Facebook Home is essentially a Facebook OS by stealth . After Facebook Home is launched on April 12 , you 'll be able to download it from the Google Play store . You can opt to just use it once or have it on your phone continuously . Facebook says that Home will have a new release every single month . Facebook Home will be available starting April 12 on the HTC One X , Samsung Galaxy S3 , the Galaxy Note 2 , and other future devices , including the Galaxy S4 . And , naturally it will also be available on the brand new HTC First , which has Facebook Home preloaded . Mark Zuckerberg opened the event by joking around the Facebook phone rumours before explaining the event was about `` how you can turn your Android phone into a great social phone ... we 're not building a phone and we 're not building an operating system , but we are building something that 's a deeper experience than an app '' . Zuckerberg said the reason for developing Home that people spend 20 per cent of their phone time on Facebook , a figure that rises when you consider Instagram - incredible when you think about it . This is essentially how the overlay works - a layer between apps and the Android OS . Facebook Home will launch on tablets `` within several months '' - the company is working on it . The cover feed is what you see when you turn on or open your phone , and it shows a continuous stream of your friends ' Facebook updates . From the Facebook Home cover feed , a finger swipe accesses apps , phone calls and the other functions you expect from a phone . Cover Feed is essentially a stream of stuff - status updates , new Instagram photos , event invites and more - all navigable with photos . If you see a photo you like , you can Like it or add a comment . Comments are all in-line . Cover Feed relies on simple gestures - `` it 's the content first '' said the demo man . As Facebook says , it `` lets you stay up-to-date on your friends ' latest activities in real-time , all the time . While Cover Feed aims to show you the most important things , Notifications still show you the crucial things . Facebook wants to shift focus away from apps and onto content , but it has also built an app launcher . Apps can be bookmarked or organised by alphabetical order . You can even post a status or check-in from here , too . Notifications from apps and friends appear right on your home screen . It 's easier to see when you have a missed call , calendar reminder or new message . Open a notification with a double tap or clear them away to see your Cover Feed . You can choose what 's on your app launcher - press and hold an app then drag it anywhere . Chatheads are a way to take away the dilemma of switching away from an app when a message comes in - you can pop right into the conversation over the app you 're using or webpage you 're browsing . Various reports before the event suggested that Facebook Home might or might not debut alongside a handset built by HTC running a forked version of Android or more likely just a special version of its Sense UI that puts Facebook front and center . It looks like it may be called HTC First . Zuckerberg has previously said that Facebook would n't launch a phone itself , saying that a smartphone `` really would n't make much sense for us to do . ''
The long-rumored `` Facebook Phone '' has taken the form of Facebook Home - not a phone at all , but `` a family of apps '' that will be deeply integrated with the Android OS . Facebook Home is a custom Android interface that , among other things , replaces the lock screen and the home screen of your Android phone with the Facebook `` cover feed . '' The cover feed is what you see when you turn on or open your phone , and it shows a continuous stream of your friends ' Facebook updates . From the Facebook Home cover feed , a finger swipe accesses apps , phone calls and the other functions you expect from a phone . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage today to introduce Facebook Home . `` Today we 're finally going to talk about that Facebook Phone , '' Zuckerberg , who previously spent months denying the existence of a Facebook Phone , said . `` Or more accurately , we 're going to talk about how you can turn your Android phone into a great , simple social device . '' That simplicity involves putting Facebook before your Android phone 's other functions , so that instead of opening your phone and navigating to Facebook , the UI works the other way around . `` More and more we just want to know what 's going on with the people around us , '' Zuckerberg said . Facebook Home will be available starting April 12 on the HTC One X , Samsung Galaxy S3 , the Galaxy Note 2 , and other future devices , including the Galaxy S4 . It will come pre-loaded on the HTC First - introduced today as the closest thing to an actual Facebook Phone that we 'll ever get .
HTC Chief Executive Peter Chou took the stage at Facebook 's press conference today to introduce the HTC First . It 's the closest thing we 'll get to a Facebook Phone , with Facebook Home , the social network 's new version of Android , pre-loaded and optimized . `` It 's a great opportunity to bring mobile and social together even more closely , '' Cho said , promising `` the best Facebook experience '' on the device . The HTC First will be available April 12 for $ 99.99 exclusively on AT & T . It will come in red , light blue , white and black . The HTC First first popped up in rumors mere days ago , when some thought it could be introduced as the first `` Facebook Phone . '' But after Facebook 's big Android announcement this morning turned out to be a custom UI and not a device itself , the HTC First became a secondary announcement . Previously , another device called the HTC Myst was thought to be the Facebook Phone , but that phone was n't even mentioned during the Facebook press conference . AT & T spilled some more details about the HTC First 's specs in a press release , revealing a 4.3-inch display and dual-core Snapdragon CPU with Android 4.1 : Jelly Bean .
`` We 're finally going to talk about that Facebook phone ... '' And thus Mark Zuckerberg began his Facebook Android event today , but before you swoon with phone-lust , he went on to add : `` Or more accurately we 're going to talk about how you can turn your Android into a great social device . `` We 're not building a phone and we 're not building an operating system . '' Instead , Facebook has created a new experience for Android called Facebook Home . It brings all the social elements of Facebook to the core of your Android phone - it 's more than an app but it 's less than an operating system and it will be available to download form the Google Play Store next week . It 's essentially a group of Facebook-friendly apps that work together . Coverfeed is the lock-screen experience - instead of just seeing the time or your wallpaper , you 'll now see what 's going on on Facebook ; status updates , check-ins and more , all with your friends ' cover photos used as a scrolling background . You can like and comment from here too . Notifications will also pop up when you have an SMS , a Facebook message or , of course , a poke . Tapping the notifications takes you into the Facebook app , which seems a little clunky given this deep integration but hey . What can you do . In case you want to access any apps that are n't Facebook , Home offers a simple app menu too which is easily customised by long-tapping and swiping icons around . Chat Heads is the way that Facebook wants to handle your messaging , both your Facebook messaging and chat , and your SMS messages . It allows you to have multiple conversations going on at once , and we can see how they came up with the name - as you get a message , your pal 's head floats across the screen and you tap it to get involved . Finished with them ? Just flick them away . So , you 're sold . You want in on this Facebook Phone action . But how do you get Facebook Home ? If you have the most recent Facebook and Messaging apps on your Android phone then you 'll see a message in the app that takes you to Google Play to download Home . Home works on the HTC One X , HTC One X+ , Samsung Galaxy S3 and Samsung Galaxy Note 2 . Plus the snazzy new HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4 , and more will be compatible in the coming months . Also coming soon is Android tablet compatibility - slated for release `` within several months '' but today 's launch applies only to Android phones .

Buffy , Myst , and now First ? The supposed Facebook phone by HTC is certainly running through the rumored names . @ evleaks , a normally reliable Twitter tipster , today posted an image of a phone with `` htc first '' emblazoned across the screen . First is styled in Facebook-esque font , while it 's written in the social network 's signature blue . All that @ evleaks has to say about the phone is : `` HTC first , 2013 . '' Powers of deductive reasoning seem to suggest that this is a Facebook phone we could see Thursday , though all may not be as it seems . Some analysis conducted by The Verge discovered that the HTC First logo was likely PhotoShopped onto the image ( you can also see a faint line bordering the words , as well ) . There 's also little in the way of distinctive markings to say whether this is an HTC phone - or device made by any specific manufacturer - or simply a generic rendering . You may remember that before the Galaxy S4 was announced , an image supposedly of the phone popped up online ( posted by @ evleaks , no less ) before it was found that it was merely place holder for the real deal . The same may be true for this pic , though perhaps it does reveal the actual name of the device said to house `` Facebook Home . '' What 's more , the First image lines up with descriptions published by 9to5Google ; that the phone would resemble a slightly larger iPhone 5 with capacitive buttons along the bottom . Monday , a report indicated the phone , up until now know as the Myst , would own a 4.3-inch screen . We do n't know about you , but all the leaks and titular options are making for quite the head-spinner . TechRadar ca n't wait to get situated in Menlo Park Thursday so we can get to the bottom of all the rumors .

With over one billion users a month , and over 83 million fake accounts , it can be tough knowing whether your online friends are real or merely a glitch in the Matrix . That 's probably why Facebook has borrowed the idea of verified accounts from its social media nemesis Twitter . Starting today , Facebook is in the process of giving blue tick verification badges to prominent public figures , including celebrities , journalists , government officials , popular brands and businesses with large audiences . The update will roll out to pages , as well as profiles . Just like Twitter , there 's no way to request verification , but the social network does offer the ability to report fake pages impersonating you . Unlike previous attempts at verification , this time around Facebook is all about the blue tick badge , which is a huge relief , really . Because what 's the point of knowing you 're real if you do n't get something to show for it , right ? While you wait for Facebook verification , why not read some more Blips ?

Facebook may be one of the most dominant social networks of all time , but the company has struggled to find its footing beyond the confines of the world wide web . With Facebook Home , Zuckerberg and crew seemed poised to finally make a big splash on smartphones that could expand the network 's outreach on mobile devices . It 's strange to think of Facebook Home having 1 million users being a bit of a disappointment , but when you consider more than 1 billion members utilize Facebook globally , the disparity is hard to ignore . That does n't seem to bother the executives at the social network though , as they see the adoption and growth of Facebook Home as a long haul effort . Speaking at the D : All Things D conference on Wednesday , Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg talked a bit about the network 's vision for Home . `` I think it will be a long road . [ The smartphone is ] an incredibly powerful device and social device , '' Sandberg said . `` We believe that the phone will get re-organized around people - Home is the first iteration of that . '' Home has n't exactly set the world on fire , and even though its available on a myriad of Android devices like the HTC One , Samsung Galaxy S4 and the dismally received ( at least in retail ) HTC First . Even those who have been brave enough to make the jump to Home have a fair share of complaints , but Sandberg promised those voices are being heard . `` We consider [ Home ] a v.1 , a very early version , '' Sandberg said . `` We would love if we could put out a v.1 version and get everything right . '' Home is supposed to be updated monthly , and time will tell if Sandberg and the rest of the Facebook team are right in believing Home has what it takes to survive amidst the rapidly changing smartphone landscape .

Travel app Waze has found itself at the centre of a bidding war between Google and Facebook , according to new information . Waze , a community driven GPS social navigation app , is one of the main data suppliers for the rather-maligned Apple Maps . In January , it was reported that Apple and Waze were in takeover talks , with Apple putting $ 500m ( about £330m , AUS $ 516m ) on the table , which Waze rejected . Then Facebook came in offering around $ 1bn ( about £660m , AUS $ 1.03bn ) - and now Google is said to making its own offer as well . Waze took the spotlight in the wake of Hurricane Sandy when government agencies contacted the company to ask its users which gas stations were running low on fuel . Both Google and Facebook see Waze as a way to improve their own standings in the mobile arena . Google will want to incorporate Waze 's real-time traffic updates and social elements into its revamped Google Maps , whereas Facebook will see Waze 's 40m users as a perfect advertising and mobile expansion opportunity . Which will come out on top ? The ball certainly seems to be in Waze 's court , so stay tuned . Via The Guardian

An actor giving a keynote at a tech show is like Slayer playing the county fair . No one knows how they got the gig and it 's hard to tell if anyone there wants to hear it . But at CTIA 2013 , Ashton Kutcher proved to be an entertaining and thoughtful speaker . While the casually dressed Hollywood star looked out of place speaking to the Oxford and khakis crowd , his fireside chat with CNBC 's Julie Boorstin was an injection of life this year 's CTIA show sorely needed . Kutcher 's talk ranged from mobile app development to his own personal tech investments to the future of digital media . Though Kutcher has been an early investor in a number of startups , including Twitter , Uber and Square , he insisted that he was `` just a consumer . '' The actor was relaxed and affable throughout the chat , which opened the final day of this year 's CTIA . Though the `` That 70 's Show '' star did have a few Kelso moments when he waxed philosophical about Facebook as the `` new religion , '' and the problem of users posting pics of their privates on the web . `` If you 're not mobile you 're antiquated , '' he quipped at one point . Throughout his talk , Kutcher stressed the importance of companies being able to serve customers on the go . He called for restraint in the mobile space , bemoaning sites that meet users at the gate with a pitch to download an app . The star even called out Twitter , a network where he has a massive presence , for being too much of an advertising space . `` When Twitter first started it felt like the democratization of media , but now it just feels like the media . '' He added that making retweeting easier `` has hurt Twitter the most . It 's a lot of people selling s * * * I do n't want . '' Kutcher went on to praise the ad tailoring on Facebook , but said that it has lost its intimacy . He described it as a `` weak-tie network , '' saying that he has too many relative strangers in his feed , which makes him less inclined to share things there . When Boorstin asked Kutcher if Facebook has mastered mobile , he replied that , `` no one has mastered mobile . '' The CNBC correspondent then asked what apps he likes , and the actor whipped out a white iPhone 5 and rattled off a few recommendations from his home screen . Kutcher said that Flipboard was part of his morning routine , and that Spotify was his music service of choice . The actor also mentioned Next Door , a social network that connects people with their neighbors , and Couple , an app designed for intimate communication between two people . The subject of digital distribution of media was enivitable for a Hollywood star at a tech show , especially with Netflix 's new season of `` Arrested Development '' days away . Kutcher said that services like Amazon developing its own content is far from a huge mistake , but investing in them early on could be . When Boorstin asked why Kutcher is n't investing in these platforms , the actor explained that online distributors will only beat out television once they can produce content of the same quality , and to do that , big money needs to be spent . Profit margins will therefore shrink , so he does n't see them as a sound investment for his portfolio . Kutcher went on to say that peer-to-peer technology interested him as an investment . When asked to name specific startups , Kutcher smirked slyly and said he 'd , `` rather not say . '' This sort of succinct talk characterized Boorstin 's chat with Kutcher , but things did get a bit strange when the actor/investor compared Facebook to religion . He said that when society moved from tribal life to metropolitan cities , people judged neighbors by their choice of religion . He arrived at the not unreasonable point that people now use social networks to vet each other . He said that , `` technology removes time , space and motion , '' and that with Facebook , `` strangers become friends of friends . '' We understand what Kutcher was getting at , but his explanation was obtuse . It felt like the kind of hazy logic that takes place in the circle on `` That 70s Show . '' Odd digressions aside , Kutcher carried himself like a knowledgeable everyman . Anyone can appreciate his closing dig at expensive cell phone service , saying that , `` If Apple wanted to turn on a unified hot spot , I do n't think I would need a carrier . ''

Pandora today announced a new form of Facebook integration for Pandora mobile apps on iOS and Android and the official Pandora web music player . Pandora sharing to Facebook has existed for some time , but the new social integration is `` effortless , '' wrote Pandora 's chief technology officer and executive vice president of product , Tom Conrad . Conrad wrote that Pandora activity can now be automatically published to Facebook , and that the activity can be integrated with Facebook 's new music section . `` This means it 's easier than ever to discover new music from friends ' listening activity in your Facebook News Feed or by checking out the music section on their profile , '' he explained . No , not a Facebook Music service - just a new tab of users ' news feeds that catalogues musical tastes and activities . The music section was introduced in March when the social network revealed its latest Facebook redesign . Pandora is the latest music listening service to integrate with this new feature . Automatic Facebook sharing can be toggled on and off at will in the Pandora apps or on the website . Users can also customize exactly what they want to share . `` This new feature puts you totally in control of what 's shared and the experience is entirely opt in , '' Conrad wrote . `` Music is a natural facilitator of connections between people and we 're excited to help strengthen those bonds around all of the music you 're discovering on Pandora , '' Conrad finished .

If there 's one thing Google CEO Larry Page hates , it 's stories talking about Google versus other companies . Unfortunately he said that after Google introduced a whole bunch of things to take on Spotify , Apple , Microsoft , Facebook and WhatsApp . That can only mean one thing : it 's Google IO time ! Google IO is Google 's developer conference , but it 's still a place where it reveals a lot that 's interesting to all of us . There was n't much on the hardware front this year - last year we got the Nexus 7 and the ill-fated Nexus Q - but we did see a Nexus-ised version of Samsung 's Galaxy S4 : this Google S4 dumps TouchWiz , runs Android 4.2 and costs $ 649 unlocked . This year 's Google IO was all about services - and `` the end of search as we know it '' . Google does n't just want to answer your questions . It wants to anticipate your needs - so for example if you search for the population of India , Google knows your next question might well be how that number compares to other countries . You wo n't even need to use your fingers : in the Chrome browser and Chrome OS you 'll be able to bark Glass-style commands : `` OK , Google , '' followed by whatever you 're looking for . As Matt Swider and Michelle Fitzsimmons explain , it 's really very clever : `` While traditional search typically relies heavily on keywords , the future of Google 's core business will attempt to define 'it ' . For example , with as little information as 'how far is it from here ' , voice search can collaborate distance and directions with current traffic conditions highlighted as well . '' Google+ is getting a massive makeover too . There 's a radical redesign , hashtags for finding related content , a new Hangouts app and significantly improved photo features - including Auto Highlight , which judges your photos and picks the best ones , and Auto Awesome , which can create collages , panoramas and animated GIFs . The Hangouts app is going to be a big deal : it 's the project we knew as Babel , and it 's going to replace Google Talk - not just on Android , but on iOS and in Chrome too . It combines text , photo and video , moves from device to device and includes the all-important Emoji characters too . Google Play Music has been upgraded as well . The new and terribly named Google Play Music All Access service is `` a music service that 's about music '' , which we think sounds like a much better idea than a music service that is n't about music . It 's a Spotify-style music subscription offering and it 'll cost US $ 9.99 ( around AU $ 10 , £6 ) per month . You 've got to feel sorry for IO attendees - at over three hours , the keynote was a real bum-number - but the Google goodies did keep on coming . Fancy better Maps ? Google has better Maps ! The new Maps app brings Google 's iOS design to Android , the app to iPads , real-time traffic improvements for everyone and much more information on the desktop - and unlike Apple 's maps , when you ask for directions to the shops you wo n't end up on the Moon . We particularly liked the new Photo Sphere , which can provide 360-degree tours of landmarks - so you might virtually wander around a gallery to check out the masterpieces . Did someone say `` masterpiece '' ? Yes , us , just there - and that 's the word Nokia 's using to describe its new Lumia 925 . Does it make Nokia the Michelangelo of mobiles , the Stravinsky of smartphones , Leonardo Da Vinci with da Lumia ? No ! But it 's very good . As Gareth Beavis explains , it 's `` a tricky beast to rate ... but there 's no doubting that it 's going to be a market-leading cameraphone . '' We 'll get our hands on it properly in June , so watch this space .

Glassholes , rejoice - your nascent eyewear is becoming more functional . A host of major Glass supporters came out of the woodwork during the second day of Google IO , while Google revealed it 's working on an expanded Glass Developer Kit and streaming video capabilities . `` Facebook for Google Glass '' app is heading to Glass , allowing users to share photos straight from Glass to the social network , bringing official FB functionality to Google 's compu-specs . For now , tagging with Glass is n't an option , but can be added via a mobile device or computer after an image is posted . Not to be outdone , Twitter is bringing `` Twitter for Google Glass '' to the fore , allowing users to share photos with their micro-blogging network . Photos are n't the only function , as Glass-having Twitterers will receive notifications of mentions , direct messages and tweets from folks they follow , but only if a Glass wearer has turned on alerts . Replying , retweeting and favoriting are additional features . Tumblr , CNN and Elle magazine are throwing hats in the Glass app ring as well , with Evernote 's previously announced app ready for its first look . As is the theme of Twitter and Facebook , Evernote for Glass will let users send a Glass-captured photo or short video to users ' Evernote accounts from within the Glass sharing menu . Reversing the flow , users can choose a note from Evernote Web and send it directly to the Glass Timeline . Apps from the The New York Times and Path were announced alongside Evernote in March . According to the Times , Google refers to the apps as `` Glassware . '' Google told us that these Glass apps `` are or should be available very soon to everyone who has the device . '' During an elbow-to-elbow session earlier today , Google said it 's developing a broader Glass kit for developers . `` We 're actively building it , '' Developer Advocate Timothy Jordan told the IO crowd , as reported by AllThingsD . Google also revealed video streaming is headed to Glass , though there 's no word on when it - or the expanded dev kit - will arrive . Until now , Google had only talked about supporting short video snippets . As for a place to host Glass apps , Jordan said that an app store is n't imminent , though the company will `` definitely '' have something up . Glass-a-cations , anyone ?

Bing users , if they so desire , can now like and comment on posts from Facebook friends that appear within the engine 's social search results . Bing introduced the social search sidebar last year in the hope that Facebook posts from the users ' networks of friends could enhance web searches . For example , if the Bing user is searching for 'Best restaurant in Shrewsbury ' there 's a good chance that a Facebook friend may have checked in with a recommendation in the past . Now Bing has deepened the integration , the user would be able to like the post or comment to ask for the best dish , for example , without leaving the search results page . In a post on the Bing blog , Nektarios Ioannides , Program Manager , cited another example of how the extension of social search may be useful . He wrote : `` How does it work ? Let 's say I 'm searching for Beyoncé tickets because I know she is coming to town soon . I can see that my friend has recently posted that she has an extra ticket to the show . `` Now without leaving the Bing results page , I comment directly to her post letting her know that I 'd love to join her for the concert . I 've gone from simply browsing to attending a concert in just a few easy steps – all thanks to Bing . '' Users will need to head to Bing.com and connect their Facebook account to give it a try .

The Android overlay Facebook Home , out for almost a month now , was only available on a handful of select devices . That is , until yesterday . Thanks to a small change , the social network 's core Android app is allowing unsupported handsets to use it anyway . Android Central reported that the May 9 update to the official Facebook app for Android appears to have added more than the scant change log may lead users to believe . As Facebook boasts of nearly hitting 1 million installations since the April 16 debut of Facebook Home , the glorified launcher can now be installed on a number of previously unsupported handsets . For those smartphones , users installing Facebook Home will be warned they `` may not get the best experience , '' with the option to go straight to Facebook proper or `` Use Home Anyway . '' At least two flagship handsets - Samsung 's Galaxy S4 and Sony 's Xperia ZL - are said to work just fine by ignoring the aforementioned warning , while a third , the HTC One , appears to be working with no prompt at all . The HTC One and Galaxy S4 were initially listed as supported by Facebook Home , but this marks the first time users have been able to install the launcher via Google Play on such devices . Thursday 's update to the official Facebook app presumably added this unofficial support , also introducing an option for persistent notifications which can be disabled via Settings . Undocumented support arrives on the heels of a steep price drop for AT & T 's Facebook Home-equipped HTC First , which U.S. buyers can now grab for a mere 99 cents with two-year agreement .
HTC First ? HTC worst , more like ! It looks like we were bang on the money when we said the so-called Facebook phone was only good `` once you dial back all that Facebook '' : it is n't selling at US $ 99 , so AT & T has dropped the price to just US $ 0.99 ( AU $ 0.97 , £0.64 ) on a two-year contract . AT & T says they do this stuff all the time , but that 's PR nonsense : price cuts this dramatic this quickly mean the First clearly is n't first on people 's shopping lists . If you want an HTC Android phone , you 'd be much better off with the wonderful HTC One . Could the Huawei Ascend Mate be the phone for you ? We 'd say no : as Joe Hanlon explains , not only is the `` phablet '' ridiculously big and heavy , but it 's slow too . `` We really wanted to love the Mate , '' he says , but where other firms have ironed out the `` laggy bugs '' in their systems , Huawei has n't . It 's `` just a step too far towards tablet territory '' , and while `` there is definitely a market for the Ascend Mate '' , we `` do n't belong to it '' . Maybe the Motorola X Phone is more up our street ? We certainly hope so : the phone , the first handset to bear the Google brand and Moto 's design , is expected to be unveiled at this month 's Google IO conference . Apparently it will be `` a real breakthrough , a game changer that will put pressure on Samsung and Apple . '' Another phone that has n't officially been announced yet is the Nokia 928 , which Michelle Fitzsimmons describes as `` one of the worst kept phone secrets of late '' . Nokia 's been busy posting photography demos that pit the 928 against the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the iPhone 5 , and you 'll be shocked - shocked ! - when you discover which one comes out best . That 's right , it 's the iPhone 5 . No ! We kid ! That 's not all Nokia 's got up its sleeve . This week , Nokia has been brimful of Asha . No , not the 1990s Cornershop classic - we 're talking about the Asha 501 , a funky little phone that bridges the gap between feature phones and smartphones . It 's fun , friendly and affordable , with a sub- $ 100 ( AU $ 97 , £64 ) price tag . Nokia 's making some nice stuff , but that does n't mean its shareholders are happy . At the company 's AGM this week , one investor suggested that Nokia was on `` the road to Hell '' . `` The problem is pretty simple , '' Gary Marshall explains . `` Nokia has bet the farm on Windows Phone , and the bet has n't paid off yet . '' Calm down everyone , says John McCann . `` The Finnish firm is almost fully back on track , '' he argues . `` This Windows Phone ride is about to get exciting - finally . '' The investors may be impatient , Marshall argues , but they do have a point . `` Nokia does n't have a Plan B , but its rivals do '' - so if their Windows Phones do n't sell , they have plenty of Android devices too . If Nokia 's Windows Phones do n't sell , `` there 's nothing else in the cupboard . '' Marshall still thinks that Nokia 's embrace of Windows Phone was `` an act of 'sod it ! Let 's go to THE MOON ! ' bravery '' , but he hopes the moonshot does n't fall short . `` If it does , '' he says , `` Nokia has n't packed a parachute . '' Is Microsoft as confident about Windows 8 as Nokia is about Windows Phone ? Perhaps not : it 's already making quite a bit of noise about Windows Blue . Blue is the next version of Windows 8 , it 's due later this year , and thanks to user feedback it 's going to make Windows more Windows-y . Blue is likely to be called Windows 8.1 , it 's likely to bring boot-to-desktop back , it 'll extend to other platforms including Windows Phone , and it might even bring back the much-missed Start button . We 'll get a full look at Blue this June - and we 're expecting to see Apple 's iOS 7 that month too . Is that because mobile firm Onswipe says traffic from iOS 7 devices is starting to spike ? No . It 's because Apple says it 'll be showing everyone `` what 's next in iOS and OS X '' at WWDC 2013 . Sherlock Holmes , eat your heart out .

Facebook 's new Home interface , the social network 's Android home screen replacement , may be labeled a success as it nears 1 million downloads . The company showed off some upcoming changes of its Android overlay today while bragging that Home increases Facebook use by roughly 25 percent . Facebook Vice President Cory Ondrejka claimed that Home users spend 25 percent more time using Facebook and send 25 percent more comments and likes , according to TechCrunch . `` Chat Heads , '' that bobble head message feature , increase Facebook chat participation by 7 percent and increase messages sent by 10 percent , Ondrejka said . Facebook also showed off some new features that will be added to Home in future updates , though not in an update being pushed out today , which focuses mostly on performance improvements and bug fixes . But future features include a deeper tutorial for new users , a `` dash bar '' that will make it easier to start new chats , and a dock that will give users more convenient access to their apps . Sure , Facebook Home is looking more and more like iOS , but that is n't necessarily a bad thing . Elsewhere , reports came in today that Facebook is in talks to buy Israeli map app company Waze for up to $ 1 billion ( around UK£64 million , AU $ 99.4 million ) . That 's what Facebook paid to acquire Instagram , and Hot Hardware reported today that Facebook is considering paying the same for Waze . Waze is a social GPS app that uses live data from drivers to provide the best routes based on traffic and other conditions . The acquisition is reportedly in the due-diligence phase , which means both sides have signed a principle agreement . News of the deal first appeared in the Hebrew-language business newspaper Calcalist . With Facebook 's attempt to take over an entire OS with Facebook Home , it 's not inconceivable that the social network would look to add social map functionality in the future . Are you listening , Google ? May want to pay attention to what 's going on in Menlo Park .

Today word spread that Facebook has come to Google Glass , albeit through a third-party app 's door . Glass to Facebook , according to Mashable , works by making users ' Facebook accounts a contact through which they can upload photos taken with the headgear . Trying to access the app via creator TeseractMobile 's website results in a security alert , which is reportedly due to the site 's root certificate , so proceed with caution if you decide to risk download . In other Glass news , Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer revealed during the Wired Business Conference in NYC that her company is tinkering around with dev versions as employees explore how wearers can access and operate Yahoo 's services . No word on whether the company plans any GG apps , says CNET , but stay tuned . Google Glass is the future and all , but you can read about what 's going on right now in our news blips .
As if your Facebook news feed was n't already cluttered enough with irrelevant sponsored posts urging you to try whatever the Sims-style game du jour is , the social network is soon to put video ads into the mix . According to the Financial Times , we can expect to start seeing the 15 second videos pop up as soon as this summer - July being the favourite month for launch . The first video you see each day will apparently autoplay but - happily - on mute . If you switch the sound on ( or accidentally hit the unmute button ) , the video will restart with the audio track . In an effort to reduce irritation , Zuckerberg and co are said to be planning to roll the ads out slowly with a trial period preceding a full onslaught . During this time , the ads will be limited - so each user should only see videos from one advertiser per day . Whether or not this will mean seeing the same video over and over , or a variety of videos from the same brand is unclear . Facebook is under growing pressure to bring in the Benjamins now that it has become a publicly listed company - hence the move into new and exciting forms of advertising . According to sources close to the matter , the social network has seen the money that YouTube 's been raking in and decided it wants a piece of the moving ad action .

Facebook has blocked Path 's access to the part of its API that allows users to find their friends on the social network . A new version of Path now allows people to find fellow users through their Twitter , Gmail and phone contacts , but the Facebook option is now nowhere to be seen . Posts and items can still be shared via Facebook , but the app no longer allows invitations or follow requests to be sent to Facebook friends . Path is n't the only app to suffer such a fate in recent times . Twitter 's new Vine video sharing app saw its access to Facebook removed immediately after launch . The restriction of Facebook 's social graph appears to be in direct response to a recent spam messaging controversy , which erupted in the last couple of months . The app came under fire for sending out text invitations to users ' contacts without permission . Digital marketeer Stephen Wright brought the issue to light after his entire phonebook received a text - or in the case of landlines , a robocall - at 6am , even after the app had been deleted . Officially , Facebook is yet to offer a reason for the new restrictions . Via TechCrunch

Facebook has launched a Trusted Contacts security tool which allows users to name up to five friends who can help them access their account if it 's been hacked or they 've forgotten a password . The social network first tested a Trusted Friends scheme back in October 2011 and not a huge amount seems to have changed judging by today 's announcement . Users who opt into the scheme can name three to five of their closest friends who 'll all be sent a security code when they 're unable to access the account . Users will need three of the security codes in order to get back into their Facebook page , enabling them to choose a new password . The more friends you pick , the easier it should be to get back the information necessary to get back in . In a post on its Notes page , Facebook advised users only to select those friends they 'd be comfortable furnishing with a spare key to their house and those they 're in contact with outside of Facebook . `` With trusted contacts , '' the company said , `` there 's no need to worry about remembering the answer to your security question or filling out long web forms to prove who you are . You can recover your account with help from your friends . '' To set up trusted contacts , enter the settings section at Facebook.com .

Facebook was able to maintain steady growth in both its revenue and active user count , the company announced in its first quarter 2013 results today . Revenue hit $ 1,458 million ( UK£937 million , AU $ 1,417 million ) in the first three months of the year , and its daily active users increased by 26 percent with an average of 665 million logged in . The social network 's monthly active user count saw a similar increase , with 23 percent growth year-over-year , amounting to an average 1.11 billion users in the first quarter of 2013 . More importantly , Facebook 's mobile active user count reached 751 million as of March 31 , a significant increase of 54 percent over the same quarter last year . `` We 've made a lot of progress in the first few months of the year , '' said Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a press release . `` We have seen strong growth and engagement across our community and launched several exciting products . '' Two of those exciting Facebook products seeing their first quarter earnings call debut are the recently launched Facebook Home app overlay . `` One of the products I 'm most excited about is Facebook Home , '' said Zuckerberg during the company 's investor earnings call . He said Home is an early yet completely new experience . `` It 's only available on a few phones . '' The company 's CEO promised that Home , which is currently built on top of Google 's Android mobile OS , will come to more devices , noting the emergence of the site 's mobile strategy . He did n't elaborate on whether Facebook Home would ever make its way to Apple devices like the iPhone 5 , or if a follow-up to the HTC First with a better camera is in development . Zuckerberg did highlight last year 's big acquisition , Instagram , which Facebook bought for $ 1 billion . The popular photo-sharing website reached 100 million monthly active users in the first quarter of 2013 . `` [ Instagram ] is really growing quickly , '' he said . `` They 're growing a lot faster now and were faster to get to 100 million [ users ] than ever was Facebook . '' That being said , Zuckerberg sees user growth , not ads , as the immediate goal of the Instagram team . `` That is the right focus for them . They have this opportunity to capture and build off this huge community , and that should be 100 percent of the focus right now . '' `` I am really optimistic about the business opportunity there , too , '' he said , looking forward , noting that Facebook advertisers are putting content in Instagram and getting huge engagement rates . `` They 're coming to us and asking for ways to make that even richer . '' While Facebook was able to purchase breakout mobile app Instagram , it ca n't buy every single new social media network out there . This has given Facebook investors pause over its ability to maintain a youthful audience in a world where Twitter continues to surge and new start-ups like Snapchat are able to capture a younger demographic . Facebook CFO David Ebersman , however , called it a myth that the under-21 audience is clicking off of Facebook in droves . `` It 's not a zero sum game , '' he said over the investor line , echoing a notable line Zuckerberg once delivered about how his company fits into the competitive social landscape . Ebersman explained that most of this information about Facebook losing that audience is based on surveys . More often than not , this is sample data meant for advertisers . Zuckerberg admitted that former Facebook games heavyweight Zynga `` has n't been as awesome as everyone would hope . '' `` With the exception of our largest partner , Zynga , who 's growth has n't been as awesome as everyone would hope , the rest of the community is actually growing quite well and is quite healthy . '' Facebook saw its largest three-month quarter of games revenue to date , despite Zynga 's 37 year-over-year decline , all thanks to other developers picking up the slack with a 60 percent payment volume increase . In addition to having a record number of people playing games on the Facebook platform , game apps that are tied to the social networking site are dominating in terms of performance . `` We 're up to 81 of the top 100 grossing iOS apps , '' said Zuckerberg . `` And 70 of the top-grossing Android apps are connecting to Facebook . '' `` The app install ad product has been another tool in developers ' arsenal , and that 's showing some real traction . I 'm pretty excited about that as well . '' Zuckerberg also touched on the recent Facebook newsfeed redesign and Graph Search launches . `` The content in there is much more visual , '' he said , noting newsfeed-based ads have followed suit in terms of presentation , calling them more engaging and `` natural . '' Another `` natural '' progression for Facebook 's advertising growth may come from new formats . `` Video is a really exciting area , '' said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg during the investor call . `` We have a video product out today . We 're seeing really strong results . '' On the topic of Graph Search , Zuckerberg said that the enhanced social search feature will roll out to Facebook 's full audience over the next couple of months . `` We gated who could use it quite aggressively , '' he said of Facebook 's long-time strategy . `` The real roll out will hopefully happen really soon .

The tech behind Facebook Messenger is set to power the global gadget network otherwise known as The Internet of Things . The Internet of Things is basically the enmeshing of your fridge with your hair straighteners , your phone , your kettle , your hat and your car - any and all internet-enabled gadgets and how they 'll work together to automate your life through the internet . As we 've explained before , the internet of things would see your fridge `` sense what 's inside , choose your next fortnight 's meal plans , order what it needs via an online supermarket and sync a delivery slot with your Gmail calendar '' . Which would be a bit presumptuous of it but save you ever getting home to a bare cupboard . The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport ( MQTT ) tech is the standard that has been adopted by the Organisation for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards - otherwise known as Oasis . Its members , which include IBM , Cisco and more wo n't be looking back in anger at Facebook Messenger , since the IMing service already puts MQTT to good use . Also using MQTT is Andy 's Twittering House , which tweets ( or used to , at least , the status of various electricals around the home on a regular basis ) and a number of academic experiments that monitor situations and provide alerts . Facebook uses MQTT because it 's fast as well as being power- and bandwidth efficient - just the ticket for a protocol that will end up facilitating communication between literally billions of bits of gadgety all over the world . So it 's all good until The Things become sentient , poke each other and enslave the human race , subjecting us to an endless dictatorship run by anthropomorphised Chat Heads . We , for one , etc . etc . Via The Register

Facebook has reportedly confirmed it is testing a new messaging feature , which would allow users to host a chat room friends could join with requiring an invitation . The feature , which TechCrunch reports is being trialled among a very small percentage of users , offers them an opportunity to set-up the room and give it a name , which is helpful for discussing certain topics . The new event then appears in the news feed of the host 's friends , who can click to join the room . Any of the host 's friends can join the room , meaning people who do n't necessarily know each other could converse with new people , and perhaps strike up a friendship through the mutual friend . The TechCrunch report said Facebook has n't decided whether the feature will be rolled out to everyone yet , but easy to see where this could have real merit those who love a good debate Say , for example , Apple has launched a new smartphone , a user could set up a room so friends could all voice their opinions on that subject , rather than simply commenting on statuses . Users could also employ the Host Chat feature to discuss an ongoing TV show , sporting event , breaking news story and so on ... Meanwhile , another feature being rolled out today is an update to the Facebook Home Android suite . As CNET reports , Facebook 3.4 for Android just landed with Beta testers bringing folders to the Facebook Home launcher , allowing users to organise like-minded apps and save space on the homescreen .

On Thursday , Facebook took the next step in audience engagement by opening a new public beta for its main Android app . Anyone can be a beta tester , as long as you have Android , the Facebook app , and have signed up for the requisite Google and Facebook groups for feedback . Facebook claimed the wide variety of different Android versions provide a challenge when testing the quality of its app , and the social network believes with the aid of its users around the globe , tracking bugs and issues on all those Android devices will be much easier . This , in theory , should result in better and more reliable performance from the vastly popular app on any and all Android smartphones and tablets . Getting in on the action requires a bit of work , as you 'll first have to sign-up for an official Facebook for Android Testers Google Group . A new `` Become a Tester '' option on the Facebook app page on the Google Play store lets you do just that , followed by a download of the app in beta form . However , the beta version is still supposed to be used as you would regularly , though Facebook admits that along with improvements and new features , the app will be slightly more unstable than the standard one . Feedback can then be given through the Facebook for Android Beta Testers group on Facebook itself , which is a wholly different group than the Facebook for Android Testers on Google . According to The Verge , Mike Shaver , director of engineering at Facebook , said this latest venture is part of an effort to make the mobile version much more like the website , in that the network wants to roll out its changes slowly to a few users before pushing the final update through . Facebook had already been testing early versions of the app with mobile manufacturers like Qualcomm , HTC , Ericsson , Sony , Huawei and MediaTek , but hopes this next step will help coalesce the Android ecosystem . For now , the beta program will be strictly limited to the main Facebook app , with the company focusing on creating the best app possible regardless of whether the consumer is using Gingerbread or Jelly Bean , or has certain hardware limitations . That said , there 's a chance the beta could extend to other Facebook Android services too , such as Facebook Home and Chat Heads . Facebook may also be interested in introducing new features for testing to see what users think before pushing them out officially to a wider audience . `` We are in the early days of Google 's beta program , but we 're excited to work on extending our testing coverage at scale and providing the best app experience to everyone using Facebook , '' said Product Manager Ragavan Srinivasan on the company 's blog .

Official Facebook and Flipboard apps are coming to Windows 8 via the Windows Store , Microsoft announced at its Build 2013 conference today . Although neither Facebook nor Flipboard representatives took to the stage , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer spoke up for the newest Windows 8 app-developing companies . `` Facebook will bring an application to the Windows 8 environment . They 're very focused on mobile , '' said Ballmer , before giving a quote-of-support from the social network . `` Mike Shavers , director of engineering at Facebook , said 'Facebook has always believed in connecting everyone on every device . ' '' `` Given our strong and long-standing partnership with Microsoft , this is an exciting way to advance that vision . '' The internet 's other FB , Flipboard , is also releasing a Windows 8 app in the Windows Store . But not just any Flipboard app - the best Flipboard app ever . `` Mike McCue , the CEO of Flipboard said 'We aspire to not only create the best Windows 8 Flipboard possible , but the best version of Flipboard possible , ' '' channeled the Microsoft head . Ballmer also announced that Microsoft recently struck a deal with the NFL to bring its content and apps to all Windows tablets , PCs and phones . Today , the NFL announced that its fantasy applications will be ported to these Windows 8 devices . Ballmer estimates that these new applications will help put the Windows Store over the 100,000 applications mark . The good news for Windows 8 users downloading a wide range of the apps is that Microsoft will be enabled auto-updates for apps downloaded in the Windows Store .

Big companies make two kinds of announcements . There are RAH RAH RAH HOORAY FOR US announcements designed to get as much attention as possible , and there are the announcements that firms sneak out on a Friday evening when all the European journalists are drunk and the US ones are heading home . Facebook 's blog post about a major security breach falls into the latter category , because Facebook really does n't want you to think about shadow profiles . As Violet Blue writes on ZDNet : `` The personal information leaked by the bug is information that had not been given to Facebook by the users - it is data Facebook has been compiling on its users behind closed doors , without their consent . '' It turns out that if Facebook ca n't get information about you from you , it 'll grab it from your friends instead . We 've known about shadow profiles for some time : in 2011 , Europe vs Facebook filed a complaint against Facebook Ireland with the Irish data protection watchdog ( PDF ) on the grounds that Facebook was collecting `` as much information of users and non-users as possible . '' Facebook strenuously denied the allegations at the time , so the leak of shadow profiles must be rather embarrassing . Here 's how it works . Let 's say you only put a very basic amount of information on your profile and keep details such as your main email address or your mobile phone number away from Facebook . If any of your friends have that information and they sync their address books with Facebook , Facebook gets that contact info . If a friend from X university or Y employer searches for you , Facebook knows it 's pretty likely that you went to X university or worked at Y employer . If you are n't on Facebook but somebody 's put your details into Facebook 's friend finder , those details are now on Facebook . Facebook is n't the only firm who stores address book details , but others such as Twitter delete the data after 18 months . Facebook does n't , and it appears to store much more information - and that 's none of your business , because other people provided it . According to Facebook , giving you any control over that information would be a freedom of speech violation . I 'm not sure that 's legal , because here in the EU we have pretty solid data protection legislation : it 's based on `` data minimisation '' , which is the principle that organisations should n't hold more data about you than is strictly necessary . `` You should not hold personal data on the off-chance that it might be useful in the future , '' the Information Commissioner 's Office says . Facebook , it seems , is doing exactly that . I 'm not one for conspiracy theories , but this one 's a beauty : when you consider that over and above the things you consciously share Facebook can also record your GPS location , the websites you visit and any information your social network contacts have about you , it looks like the sort of thing the security services would just love . By an interesting coincidence , Facebook 's former security chief , a former FBI man who left Facebook in 2010 , now works at the NSA . If you 're looking for me , I 'm the one in the tinfoil hat .
Those rumours of a Facebook RSS reader just wo n't die , and now we 're hearing more about what the anticipated Google Reader replacement may look like . According to The Wall Street Journal , Facebook 's app will be primarily targeting mobiles and tablets , and will takes its design cues from Flipboard with a similar stylish way of aggregating articles . Facebook has reportedly given its project the super unimaginative and not-so-secret codename of `` Reader '' , with Mark Zuckerberg himself said to be working on the project . Facebook is said to have been working for over a year on its news reading app , meaning the wheels were in motion before Google announced it was to close doors on Google Reader . Facebook 's recent addition of hashtags also added to speculation that it was moving into trending news territory . However , we 've no idea as to when ( or if ) Facebook will unleash its news collector . But with Google Reader is set to shut down on July 1 , it may not be long until Facebook answers the cries of RSS fans who suddenly find themselves searching for an alternative in a terrifying world of non-aggregated news .

The Facebook nightmare of a security bug exposing the contact information of some of its more than 1 billion members has come true , the social networking company admitted today . The good news is that the impact was minimal , outing only 6 million members ' email addresses and phone numbers in a very roundabout way , and Facebook has already corrected the White Hat glitch . `` No company can ensure 100 percent prevention of bugs , and in rare cases we do n't discover a problem until it has already affected a person 's account , '' Facebook said in a statement . `` A bug may have allowed some of a person 's contact information ( email or phone number ) to be accessed by people who either had some contact information about that person or some connection to them . '' Facebook 's friend recommending service , which asks to use a member 's third-party contact lists and address books , is the source of this White Hat bug . `` We try to match that data with the contact information of other people on Facebook in order to generate friend recommendations , '' explained the company . `` Some of the information used to make friend recommendations and reduce the number of invitations we send was inadvertently stored in association with people 's contact information as part of their account on Facebook . '' There is no evidence that this bug was exploited maliciously , according to Facebook , which said it has not received complaints from users or detected anomalous behavior . That 's probably because it would have taken a little work for a chance to access the exposed information . `` If a person went to download an archive of their Facebook account through our Download Your Information ( DYI ) tool , they may have been provided with additional email addresses or telephone numbers for their contacts or people with whom they have some connection . '' `` This contact information was provided by other people on Facebook and was not necessarily accurate , but was inadvertently included with the contacts of the person using the DYI tool . '' Facebook immediately disabled the DYI tool and fixed the issue within 24 hours , however , it 's still emailing the 6 million potentially affected users . It stressed that `` no other types of personal or financial information were included and only people on Facebook – not developers or advertisers – have access to the DYI tool . '' `` Your trust is the most important asset we have , '' Facebook said at the conclusion of its statement . `` We are committed to improving our safety procedures and keeping your information safe and secure .

What 's worth $ 290 billion and goes SCREEECH WHEEEEE VROOM ? You got it : Microsoft doing a U-turn over its Xbox One plans . Wags immediately dubbed the decision an Xbox 180 , and as Matt Swider and Michelle Fitzsimmons explain , the decision `` does away with the much-maligned 24-hour check-in requirement that would have made even offline , disc-based games null and void with a day-long dropped internet connection '' and kills the used games policy `` that would have banned certain types of trade-ins of disc-based games . '' That 's great , says Patrick Goss : the decision `` is hugely sensible , and should begin to draw a line under a launch that even the staunchest fans would describe as difficult . '' Gary Marshall agrees , but wonders how things got this far in the first place . `` The problem is that tech firms live in SuperSexyFutureLand and , sadly , the rest of us do n't , '' he says . `` in SuperSexyFutureLand people are so excited about what a product can do , they ignore the negatives because the negatives do n't affect them . '' It 's not just Microsoft , either : the same attitude underpins disasters such as Apple 's iOS 6 maps launch and Facebook 's ill-fated Home . It 's hubris and `` they might want to look at that , '' Marshall suggests . `` The biggest threat to successful tech firms is n't competition . It 's complacency . '' Or maybe it 's the feds . The PRISM scandal rumbled on this week in a stack of more denials , this time from Google : the firm 's legal boss David Drummond stated categorically : `` We 're not in cahoots with the NSA and there is no government programme that Google participates in that allows the kind of access that the media originally reported . '' Apple , Microsoft and Facebook have said much the same , and it seems that some of the most dramatic claims about PRISM - that firms were colluding with the authorities for mass surveillance - were n't true . That does n't mean the authorities are n't watching , of course - but many people believe that it 's the tech firms we should worry about , not the security services . This week officials in several countries joined forces to seek assurances from Google over Glass 's privacy issues , writing an open letter to CEO Larry Page about their concerns . They 're particularly worried about the combination of Glass and facial recognition technology ; Google has banned such apps for the time being , but that ban probably wo n't be permanent . Not everyone worries about being photographed , of course , and Facebook 's just made oversharers ' and meme posters ' lives easier by enabling photo uploads to comment threads . At first we were like * sadface * but then we were like * picture of amused cat * and our friends were like * photo of bored dog in a canoe wearing a hat at a jaunty angle * . Is it us , or is it cold in here ? No , it 's not us : it 's because HELL FROZE OVER : after just six short years Microsoft Office is now available on iPads , and this week it turned up in the UK app store , moving Chris Smith to write that it gives us `` the Power ( Point ) to Excel at Word '' . `` The Office Mobile app enables subscribers to and view and edit Word , PowerPoint and Excel documents , with any changes synced back to the cloud , '' he says , but `` Microsoft 's offering is of no use to users without an Office 365 membership . '' If you want one of those it 's £7.99 per month or £79.99 per year , and you need to sign up separately because Microsoft does n't want to give Apple a cut . So why did Office on iOS take so long ? `` Microsoft has continually held off on launching the suite as it attempted to push Office as a Windows Phone-exclusive feature , while also looking to establish Windows-based tablets as iPad alternatives , '' Smith explains . Still , 2013 's better than many had expected : earlier this year , Microsoft 's roadmap suggested Office would n't hit iOS until late 2014 . Office is n't the only thing that 's slow to appear on iPads , though : the iPad version of iOS 7 was conspicuous by its absence at WWDC , and it 's still not available - but emulator screens are beginning to appear . You 'll be amazed to discover that it 's very like iOS 7 on an iPhone , but bigger . As Apple 's Phil Schiller might put it : `` does n't innovate any more , my ass . ''

We are mere hours away from Facebook 's mysterious press event where the social network is expected to unveil a video sharing service a bit like Twitter 's Vine . While reports up until this point have suggested this largely unnecessary motion picture exchange will be part of Instagram , the WSJ is now saying it wo n't . Or , at least , it 's not saying it will , based on patchy reports from anonymous sources , or a dream it once had perhaps . The WSJ 's insiders/spirit animals say that Facebook will unveil `` pieces '' of a `` Vine-like video service '' . What 's that , a tech company announcing something that is n't quite ready ? Would n't that be shocking . Whether these reports are true or not will remain an unsolved mystery for a few hours ' longer ; but we 'll be live at Facebook 's big event today so stay tuned for some actual facts as they are revealed . Via Gizmodo
Adding a photo inside a Facebook comment has been a laborious task , but the social networking site is addressing this first-world with photos that can be uploaded directly inside replies . `` When I 'm talking with a friend , sometimes showing a photo helps me tell a story much better than words alone , '' explained Facebook engineer Bob Baldwin in a post . `` If we 're hanging out in person , I can show a photo from my phone , but on Facebook I 'd have to post a link to a photo . Now , you 'll be able to attach a photo directly when posting a comment . '' Baldwin asked his friends to try out Facebook 's new photo-in-comments feature , to which 25 people replied - one with an obligatory cat meme . Previously , to get a photo inside a Facebook comment , users had to insert a link to another destination like the popular photo uploading service imgur.com . This created an awkward `` link preview '' along with the image , and kept the usually way-too-long hyperlink string intact . Today 's change does away with the need for a `` link preview '' and distracting hyperlink , and simply puts just the photo out there for everyone to see . This is the latest update to the Facebook , which recently added nested comments and a streamlined Timeline in advance of its mobile-friendly design rollout .

We 're hearing that the world 's biggest social network is on the hunt for a new friend to help it with its mobile strategy , as it was apparently less than impressed with its HTC fling . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has met with the head of Samsung in South Korea to discuss various partnerships between the two firms - which has led many to think it 's on the lookout for a manufacturer for the much-talked-about Facebook Phone . With a disappointing reception for the HTC First , Facebook is licking its wounds as its new Home software overlay for Android appears to be a flop , so turning to the world 's biggest smartphone manufacturer seems to make sense . According to Bloomberg , Zuckerberg discussed ways to generate ad revenue from mobile phones , as the social networking site finds more and more of its users logging in with their smartphones , and thus bypassing the majority of the ads you get on the desktop site . To get on-the-spot news , app tips and the full lowdown on Samsung 's latest mobile announcements check out Samsung 's Your Mobile Life on TechRadar . Meanwhile the Korea Herald is reporting that Zuckerberg was talking about a `` Facebook-friendly '' smartphone with the Samsung executives - although the South Korean firm has tried to distance itself from these reports . Separate sources claim Samsung does n't currently have any interest in developing a phone with Facebook - so it 's all a little confusing at the moment , although it 's worth remembering Zuckerberg himself has previously said Facebook does n't have any plans to develop a network branded handset .

Update : A report out June 18 lends yet more credence to the rumors we will see Instagram add video June 20 . According to multiple in-the-know sources speaking with AllThingsD , the one and only announcement Facebook has planned for Thursday is the Instagram video product . Though details are few and far between , sources indicate Facebook does n't want to be perceived as a Vine copycat , though there was no mention if Facebook has done anything to remedy that perception . Vine , meanwhile , has said it plans to introduce `` some exciting new parts '' in the coming weeks , leaving us to wonder , whose clips will reign supreme ? Original article ... Get ready for an influx of olde time video clips as the latest speculation has Instagram launching video sharing at Facebook 's event on June 20 . The word comes from TechCrunch 's inside source , who says that the app will allow people to take and share short videos through the same app . Before you get too excited ( as we can tell you are ) , even TechCrunch admits that this could be a planned red herring on Instagram-owner Facebook 's part , as it seems pretty set on keeping specific details of the event under wraps . Given that this is only a very tenuous maybe for the time being , the source did n't reveal any more details of possible video filters or whether it 'll enforce a Vine-style time limit on video clips . Thanks to the heightened secrecy from Zuck and co , no one 's really sure what Facebook has up its sleeve for June 20 . If it 's not Instagram Video then the other big rumour is that it could be an RSS reader service to fill the gaping void that Google Reader is about to leave in our lives . Or maybe even both . Other than that , we 'll just have to wait and see - we 'll be on hand to bring you the big Facebook news as it breaks on June 20 , so stay tuned .

Facebook and Microsoft have disclosed how many government requests they have received for user data following the Prism surveillance scandal that 's enveloped the tech world . Following reports on Friday , which claimed Facebook had been pushing for transparency , it has now been granted permission to disclose the volume of requests from law enforcement and agencies like the NSA . So here 's the nitty gritty : In the six months leading up to the end of December 2012 , Facebook said it received between 8,000 and 9,000 requests relating to up to 18,000 to 19,000 individual profiles . These requests , the company said , spanned cases like sheriffs hunting missing children , police investigating an assault , marshalls tracking a fugitive or the NSA probing a terrorist threat . In a blog post Facebook reiterated that , of these requests , some are rejected outright , while it often asks the government to scale back requests , while sometimes it simply does n't provide all of the details requested . Importantly , what the figures do n't state is how many of those requests were made or granted under the controversial Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act ( FISA ) , but Facebook said it will continue to push for that data to be revealed . The social network wrote : `` We will continue to be vigilant in protecting our users ' data from unwarranted government requests , and we will continue to push all governments to be as transparent as possible . '' Soon after Facebook 's disclosure , Microsoft followed up by revealing it had been subject to 6,000 to 7,000 requests in relation to 31,000 to 32,000 accounts , in the six months leading up to December 31 2012 . Those requests spanned `` criminal and national security warrants , subpoenas and orders , '' from local , state and national agencies , but again the company said it was n't allowed to be more specific in relation to FISA requests . In a blog post , John Frank , Microsoft 's Vice President & Deputy General Counsel , said the company will continue to push for more information . He wrote : `` We appreciate the effort by U.S. government today to allow us to report more information . We understand they have to weigh carefully the impacts on national security of allowing more disclosures . With more time , we hope they will take further steps . Transparency alone may not be enough to restore public confidence , but it 's a great place to start . '' Meanwhile , both Google and Twitter have shunned the opportunity to make similar disclosures , with the former stating that lumping criminal requests in with national security requests would be a backward step . In a statement Google told AllThingsD : `` We have always believed that it 's important to differentiate between different types of government requests . We already publish criminal requests separately from National Security Letters . Lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users . Our request to the government is clear : to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests , including FISA disclosures , separately . '' In a tweet , Twitter 's legal director Benjamin Lee concurred with Google 's assessment . He wrote : `` We agree with @ google : It 's important to be able to publish numbers of national security requests—including FISA disclosures—separately . '' Google has protested its innocence during the last week , writing to the government to request permission to release the information . Twitter had been somewhat incubated from the criticism following reports it had been one of the few companies to take a hard-line stance with the government . So there you have it . Is this the first step towards greater transparency over what the US government is seeking through its controversial PRISM surveillance scheme or simply a little appeasement in the hope that the scandal will die down ? The onus is now on tech companies to keep pushing .

Facebook has reportedly asked for special permission from the US government to give the public more insight into the data it hands over to the NSA . In the wake of the Prism surveillance scandal , which has rocked the western world , some tech companies have come under huge criticism for handing over user private data to the Obama administration . Facebook has strenuously denied giving the Agency backdoor server access , but reports claim the social network and others like Google , Apple and Microsoft have 'made it easier ' for the government 's so called 'lawful ' requests . Now , according to AllThingsD , Facebook wants to disclose aspects of what is does and does n't reveal , perhaps in order to lessen the blows dealt to its already dodgy reputation when it comes to user privacy . If the plea is granted , which in the current climate seems somewhat unlikely , Facebook would be able to tell users about the number of requests it grants compared with the number it receives . Earlier this week Google , which also strenuously denies any wrongdoing or betrayal of its law-abiding users , wrote to the FBI and the country 's Attorney General to make the same request . The guidelines , if granted , would n't just apply to Facebook and Google but to all internet companies , AllThingsD points out . Has the last couple of weeks damaged your faith in the tech giants we trust with our most personal information ? Let us know in the comments section below .
After Google announced its plans to shutter its Google Reader RSS service on July 1 , a bevvy of dedicated users suddenly found themselves without a way to conveniently track subscriptions . A handful of other sites like Feedly and Digg offered up new solutions , but now another internet giant may be testing the waters for an RSS feed of its own . According to TechCrunch , new application programming interface ( API ) coding has appeared on Facebook , giving the impression the social network might be eager to snap up those users about to be abandoned by Google in a few weeks time . Lines of code with the phrasing `` rssfeeds '' first appeared in Facebook 's Graph API , and indicated the RSS info would be tied to a user 's Facebook ID . Those uncovered lines also feature information about title , URL , time of update , as well as coding for entries and subscribers . When the developer who discovered the code tried to run the data through Facebook 's API Explorer , he was met with a warning message that stated the features were restricted to whitelisted addresses . Since the code ca n't be seen by anyone that Facebook does n't want to see it , there 's no way to tell if this would even be an actual RSS feed , or if the information would be limited to Facebook 's content or would incorporate outside sources . Facebook previously had an RSS subscription option for Pages , however that feature was phased out at the end of 2012 , which was around the same time Facebook updated its Timeline . There 's a chance Facebook might debut its new RSS features next week , as the social network has scheduled an event for next Thursday , June 20 . The invite claimed a `` big idea '' was coming , and with July 1 rapidly approaching , it certainly would make sense to get potential users hyped for the new service before Google shuts Reader down for good . TechRadar reached out to Facebook for more on its possible RSS practices , and will update this story when we learn more .

Imagine being friends with someone who worked at Facebook . You 'd wear a cool T-shirt and they 'd have the same one a few weeks later . You 'd invite them into your home and they 'd order exact replicas of your sofa and your TV . You 'd use a feature on a rival social service and they 'd quickly come up with their own version . Yep , Facebook 's getting hashtags . Facebook users already post hashtags , but until now those tags did n't do anything : you could n't click on a hashtag about , say , Game of Thrones and see 1,000 people going OMG about the current episode . You can on Twitter , of course , and if there 's one thing Facebook ca n't stand it 's the thought of people doing something on the internet that does n't involve Facebook . Cue hashtag support . Facebook wants to `` surface '' - a word only used to mean `` highlight '' or `` identify '' by utter , utter arses - `` some of the interesting discussions people are having about public events , people and topics . '' By `` surface '' - * spits * - they mean copy Twitter ; trending topics are next on the horizon , followed by Sally Bercow being sued for libel * innocent face * . It 's all about the ads , of course . While hashtags wo n't contain advertising to begin with , it 's too tempting an opportunity for Facebook to pass up - and it 's too tempting an opportunity for the spammers to pass up too . If you 're sharing your updates publicly , hashtags and trends will be hijacked by spammers and scammers just like they are on Twitter . Here 's Facebook 's pitch to marketers : `` Like other Facebook marketing tools , hashtags allow you to join and drive the conversations happening about your business . We recommend that you search for and view real-time public conversations and test strategies to drive those conversations using hashtags ... `` Over time , our goal is to build out additional functionality for marketers , including trending hashtags and new insights , so that you can better understand how hashtags fit into your overall Facebook advertising strategies and drive your business objectives . '' We 've already got huge in-app ads with video ones on the horizon , news feeds full of people hitting Like to win a year 's supply of toilet roll and enormous blocks of sponsored content ; now , we 're going to get even more exciting ways for marketers to drive their business objectives . What I 've long suspected appears to be true : Facebook is n't a social network but a sociological experiment . The goal ? To discover just how annoying a service can become without its users buggering off .

Adults always warned children of peer pressure , and the perils of doing what everyone else was doing for the sake of fitting in and not being a social outcast . Apparently Facebook does n't much care for sage advice , as the social network has finally succumbed to waves of users tagging status updates with hashtags , even though Facebook did n't support them . Now , like Twitter , Tumblr , Pinterest and its own Instagram networks , Facebook will begin integrating hashtags - giving users a way to follow public conversations beyond the confines of their own friends . While it certainly took long enough , it 's not all that surprising given just how many people post the same comments across multiple social networks , hashtags and all . Hashtags on Facebook will work nearly identically to the way you 're using them already on Twitter and Instagram . By clicking on a hashtag , you 'll see a news feed that allows you to see what other people are saying about the very topic that 's been tagged . You 'll be able to search for tags through the search bar , open up hashtags from other services like Instagram directly from your feed , and even post directly to the hashtag feed once you 're there . It 's literally the same feature you 've been using across other hashtag-compatible networks , only now , it 's on Facebook , too . Of course , this is only the first part of a new wave of features Facebook is rolling out to help you find what others are saying in public conversations . The network 's future plans include trending hashtags ( can you hashtag a hashtag ? ) , which should serve to guide you towards more of the world 's conversations without ever having to leave the friendly confines of Facebook . At least now when your co-worker posts , `` # caseofthemondays '' on Facebook , it will serve as more than just a reminder about how clueless he is on the web , but that wo n't make it any less annoying .
Microsoft , Facebook and Google have come together to ask for the ability to publish details of data handover requests , as they continue to deny involvement in the PRISM surveillance program . The tech giants have all asked the National Security Agency to allow them to publish Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) requests so they can prove that they 're not guilty of handing over users ' private information . Currently , these companies are blocked by non-disclosure agreements that prevent them from revealing information about NSA-requested data – which they claim has not been disclosed . In its request , Google asked the Attorney General and Federal Bureau of Investigation to wave this restriction so it can prove that it 's not guilty . `` Google 's numbers would clearly show that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims being made . Google has nothing to hide , '' it said . Facebook made a similar move , posting a public message that declared it `` would welcome the opportunity to provide a transparency report that allows us to share with those who use Facebook around the world a complete picture of the government requests we receive , and how we respond . '' Microsoft confirmed that it had also put forward a transparency request , telling Reuters : `` Our recent report went as far as we legally could and the government should take action to allow companies to provide additional transparency . '' Twitter lawyer Alex Macgillivray meanwhile tweeted `` We 'd like more NSL transparency and Twitter supports efforts to make that happen '' . Each of these companies have been accused of being implicated in the massive PRISM scandal , involving a program used by the US government to request information on users from the world 's biggest tech companies , including emails and photos .

Google is close to agreeing a billion dollar deal to buy the popular navigation app Waze , according to reports this weekend . The Globes business newspaper , in the start-up 's home country of Israel , claimed that Google has beaten out competition from Facebook with an offer of around $ 1.3 billion ( around UK£0.84 , AUD $ 1.36 ) . Waze is a community-sourced app , with users uploading real-time traffic , accident , police presence and gas price information , while maps themselves are also edited by groups of users . The company reportedly rejected a takeover offer from Apple to assist its Apple Maps platform , before Google and Facebook revealed their interest . It was thought that Facebook had a deal in place to buy the Waze back in May , but talks fell through according to recent reports . If a deal is completed , it 'll allow Google to boost its own market-leading turn-by-turn navigation services , while also eliminating one of its only real competitors . So far Google has declined to comment on the reports , so we 'll wait for the official word . Via CNET

Microsoft has revamped its Bing Desktop application , to bring Facebook notifications into the mix , along with some other relatively newsworthy changes . The app , which brought Facebook integration by displaying friends ' posts and statuses earlier this year , will now serve up a red flag next to the ' F ' icon whenever the user receives a notification . Beyond that , there 's also a neat inline search feature which allows users to highlight phrases in documents and click the Bing icon to perform a quick web search . `` Ever been reading an article and wanted to get more information about a topic or phrase ? '' the company wrote in a blog post . `` We know how lots of people deal with this : copy the text , launch a browser and paste the words into the search box . With Inline Search , now all you have to do is highlight what you want to search , hit the Bing icon and you will see a preview of search results in a convenient window without ever leaving what you were doing . '' The app has also overhauled its News section , allowing users more control over the categories of story they see , while there 's also a picture-based 'trending topics ' section . Lastly there 's a new real-time weather app , which the company says ( not unlike other weather services ) should help you decide whether to pack an umbrella .

Poor Facebook seems to be going in the wrong direction with its Home launcher , adding a much-needed Favorites tray while breaking support for two of the hottest Android smartphones around . Android Community reported Thursday that the latest update to Facebook for Android appears to be off to a rocky start , at least for owners of certain high-profile handsets . First the good news : The latest Facebook update released to Google Play adds welcome new features such as changing the audience for existing posts and sending multiple photos in a single message . The social network also added bug fixes for Facebook Home users , along with the ability to `` customize your app launcher by dragging the apps you use most to a new favorites tray . '' While the Facebook Home launcher itself was n't actually updated , the official Facebook app introduces the ability to add Android apps to a Favorites tray , complete with a row at the bottom available for one-tap use . Or at least that 's the idea - the report claims the update breaks Facebook Home support on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One , two of the most popular Android smartphones around . Both handsets received official Facebook Home support in May , suggesting the sudden lack of support is a bug which will soon to be rectified by another update , either to Home itself or the official Facebook app . On the brighter side , the Facebook update also introduces new privacy settings for what can be shared with Facebook Home , along with always welcome `` stability and memory improvements . ''

It 's fair to say that Facebook probably envisioned a little more success and traction than its Home launcher for Android has achieved since its launch in April . However , we had n't realised the company had become so desperate to convince Android owners to give it a try that it would issue a 'do n't worry , you can turn it off if it sucks ' assurance on its own website . In a post on the Facebook Mobile feed , which TechCrunch reports appeared in ads on some users ' news-feeds , the company advised users they could get rid of Home whenever they needed some 'alone time ' . The post read : `` Cover feed on the HTC First keeps your friends close by . But if you need some alone time , simply turn off Home and use your phone as usual . '' The HTC First , of course , is the first handset to launch with the Facebook Home experience built in , and judging by the commercial reception , it 's likely to be the HTC Last also . Just this week , the company expressed acknowledged that , for some , the overbearing nature of Facebook Home had put off some Android users . Speaking at the D11 conference COO Sheryl Sandberg said version one of the app was a 'love it or hate it ' deal , and said the company or working to make it more appealing to lighter Facebook users . She said : `` For the people who do n't love it , they do n't like how it takes over their phone . They do n't like how the launcher re-organizes the apps they 've already launched , but for the most part they actually like the two core features we launched which are Cover Feed and Chat Heads . So what we are doing is getting that feedback . I do n't know how long it will take . I think it will be a long road . but we really believe we 're on a path to making phones more social . '' Is there a future for Facebook Home among the masses ? Or will it forever be consigned to those Facebook-obsessed smartphone owners who wish to use their device for little else ?

Facebook is widely known for making drastic changes to its site by releasing complete overhauls ( Timeline , anyone ? ) or adding new components like the Graph Search function . But today , Facebook announced a new kind of feature called Embedded Posts , a tool publishers and users can plug into their websites and blogs . So far , only five media websites have launched EPs - Bleacher Report , CNN , Huffington Post , Mashable and People - with Facebook stating the plugin will be available to other sites soon . This move is surprisingly late compared to the likes of YouTube , Twitter , Vine and Instagram , where you can already embed posts just about anywhere . Though , probably due to the success of these other sites , it 's then not surprising the social media giant would reach out its tentacles into the rest of the public sphere . Users will be able to embed public ( and only public ) photos , posts with hashtags , videos and other content from Facebook onto their blogs and web sites . This means lots of interaction as people can click on the hashtags and even like the page directly from the Embedded Post . To embed a post yourself , simply hover the audience selector ( a globe icon ) to make sure the post is public and then click to view the dropdown menu where you 'll see `` Embed Post . '' You will notice a dialog box with the code to embed your post pop up ; copy and paste the code to your site in the place where you want it to show up , and voilà , you 're done - Facebook is now on your page . If changes are made to the post , it will no longer display properly and instead , a message saying the post is no longer available will take its place . Additionally , the size of Embedded Posts can not be customized and will display as the same size seen on Facebook . This little Embedded Posts feature is sure to be a big hit considering Facebook has more than 1.1 billion monthly users . Which site is next ? Tumblr , we 're looking at you .

Millions of Facebook users already check their News Feeds during prime time television hours , so the social network is said to be taking the next step in its TV-time takeover by introducing TV-style ads . Facebook video ads in the News Feed are expected to be 15 seconds long , according to anonymous Bloomberg sources . That could earn the top social networking company as much as $ 2.5 million a day ( about £1.63 million , AU $ 2.75 million ) courtesy of its 1.15 billion users and their roughly 2.3 billion eyeballs . The video ad spots will be limited to three a day , according to the sources . And if 15 seconds sounds familiar , it should ; that 's the maximum length for Video on Instagram posts , so we could see plenty of cross over . Even if video ads are introduced , the number of of them is n't expected to increase based on comments made by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg . `` Right now , ads on average make up about 5 percent or one in 20 stories in News Feed , '' said Zuckerberg in a conference call last week . `` We 're going to invest more in improving the quality [ of ads ] . Our top priority is to expand the number of marketers and overall demand in our system rather than just increasing the number of ads that we show . '' Facebook executives have repeatedly alluded to the platform 's ability to capture the television audience and their ongoing effort to roll out video ads . `` Every night , 88 million to 100 million people are actively using Facebook during prime time TV hours in United States alone , '' said Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg during last week 's call . `` [ A ] campaign for Lysol targeted moms and drove a two times return on ad spend for their brand . Their campaign for Air Wick was even better , driving a five times return on ad spend . '' Facebook could make these typical television advertisers feel even more comfortable than they already do with 15-second videos targeted at people who `` like '' their product or `` like '' similar or competing items . Facebook already has a video ads product for advertisers , but not of the auto-playing variety . `` Marketers can embed a video in a page post , and we see a lot of marketers using that product and seeing good results , '' said Sandberg . `` The demand to do more in video on Facebook is there , and we 're exploring how we can expand that , but we do n't have anything new to announce today . '' These comments echoed what Sandberg said three months ago : `` Because of marketers ' inherent liking video as a format , we continue to explore new [ types of ads ] as well . '' Outside of these `` exploratory '' statements , Facebook is staying mum on the subject of video ads . `` Facebook has no comment , '' a spokesperson for the social network told TechRadar today . That means we 're likely to wake up and see the TV-style ads roll out on the news feed without any sort of official announcement .
Facebook 's interest in becoming a distribution platform for mobile games has gone from rumblings to official today , with Zuckerberg and Co announcing the pilot program of its Mobile Games Publishing initiative . The plan is to help get the games of `` small and medium-sized developer '' ' off the ground and out to a bigger audience with Facebook playing the part of the publisher . Facebook believes it 's in the perfect position to help developers get their work out and noticed in the extremely crowded mobile games market . Facebook is n't saying much on how money will actually be generated , although a previously leaked report ( which was the first hint at the initiative ) claimed that revenue would come through ads , with Facebook then taking its own slice . Facebook wo n't play a hand in the content of the games themselves , but will guide on advertising and the analytics stuff . If you 're a developer and think you have a shot , you can go fill in all your details over on the Facebook site right now .

Sony will debut its brand new , feature-packed camera interface to harness the rumoured 20-megapixel camera on its next flagship 'Honami ' phone , leaked snaps seem to confirm . The Gadget Helpline site , which brought us leaked snaps of the device ( aka Xperia 1i ) last week , has now posted pics of the new camera UI , previously outed by XDA developers earlier this month , running on the device . The new pics showcase the new Timeshift Burst mode , which enables users to select 'the best moment ' from a selection of pictures , while there 's also a new Effects & Filters post-production screen . The AR Effect mode , which will could enable Augmented Reality images to be superimposed onto pictures , is also pictured running on the device . The example pictured above showcases a dinosaur walking across the frame . Scary . Another significant new feature mentioned , but not pictured , is Social Live which , TGH claimed , will facilitate live video streaming to Facebook . There 's also another look at a second AR feature called Info-Eye , which will enable users to discover more about their surroundings by using the device 's camera . Sony is yet to officially confirm 'Honami ' or 'Xperia 1i ' or whatever it decides to call it , but the device is likely to succeed the impressive Xperia Z phone . Recent speculation has pointed to a 5-inch Full HD display , 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 chip , Qualcomm Adreno 330 graphics , 2GB of memory , 16GB of storage , microSD , LTE and NFC support .

Facebook seems to have overcome the ad revenue dilemma that plagued its initial public offering a year ago , thanks to significant mobile ad revenue growth . Reporting its second quarter 2013 earnings , the top social networking company announced that 41 percent of its advertising revenue came from mobile ads in that time . `` Soon we 'll have more revenue on mobile than desktop , '' said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during the company 's earnings call . `` We now have more daily [ active users ] on mobile than on desktop . Nealy half a billion people use Facebook on their phones every day . '' Facebook 's impressive mobile returns go into the pot of total revenue , which it announced as $ 1.81 billion ( about £1.18b , AU $ 1.95b ) for the three-month span ending June 30 , an increase of 53 percent year-over-year . Facebook continues to make money off of your peepers and clicks , with ads accounting for $ 1.60 billion ( about £1.04b , AU $ 1.72b ) . It supplemented its main revenue with payments and fees for virtual items like games and gifts with $ 214 million ( about £139m , AU $ 230m ) in the second quarter . These better-than-expected mobile figures came despite the fact that Facebook can only show so many ads on devices with smaller screens , i.e . smartphones and tablets . The shift from the web to mobile users increased , with 819 million monthly active users on smaller devices in the quarter . When web and mobile were combined , Facebook had 1.15 billion monthly active users in that same time frame . Zuckerberg made a point to say that this includes teens , as the company is constantly combating reports that its popularity among younger demographics has been slipping . `` One specific demographic I want to address is U.S. teens , '' he said . `` There 's been a lot of speculation that fewer teens are using Facebook . But based our our data that just is n't true . '' `` We believe that we have close to fully penetrated in the U.S. teen demographic for a while and the number of teens using Facebook on a daily and monthly basis has been steady over the past year and a half . '' They remain `` really highly engaged '' when using Facebook , according to Zuck 's data , and these numbers do n't include the company 's Instagram product that 's popular with young amateur photographers . Of course , he noted that measurements in this area are n't perfect as some pre-teens tend to lie about their age . To sign up for Facebook you must be at least 13 years old . Zuckerberg looked at Facebook 's next five to 10 years during the call and what it would take to reach the next five billion people on the social network . `` There are three main goals I 'd like us to achieve , '' he said . `` Connect everyone , understand the world , and help build the knowledge economy . '' Most people on Planet Earth do n't have smartphones or data plans , noted Zuckerberg , but they still have the desire to share and be connected on Facebook . In addition to looking beyond developed countries , the CEO wants text and photo updates that dominate users ' updates to carry more meaning in an effort to `` understand the world . '' According to Zuck , this includes `` long-term knowledge about the world like what people are interested in , which restaurants are good , which hotels your friends have stayed at , and so on . '' `` We want to lead our community to create a graph of all that understanding to power that intelligence . '' Building the knowledge economy is something Zuckerberg calls a core part of Facebook 's mission , as the advertising platform not only helps his company reap billions , but also helps brand awareness for other business out there .
As it scratches around trying to eke as much money out of your profile as possible , Facebook will soon start asking you why - WHY GOD WHY - you keep hiding ads and stories that show up in your news feed . Whether `` because I do n't care that my distant aunt 's friend 's baby exists '' and `` because I do n't want to see ads in my newsfeed '' will be options , remains to be seen . The good news is that you could stop your friends ' suffering the same tedious ads for toilet paper and out-of-focus pictures of half-eaten burgers as Facebook will use your feedback to preemptively hold posts back from other news feeds . TechRadar 's blips , all up in your newsfeed :

Facebook 's Graph Search service – you know , the one Mark Zuckerberg announced way back in January – is finally beginning its public roll-out , starting today . The enhanced search has been available to a very small number of people so far , but Facebook is now unleashing the service onto several hundreds of millions of U.S. users this week . What does Facebook Graph Search do , you ask ? Well , we promise that it 's a little more exciting than it sounds . A little . The tool is designed to let you search through your connections for very specific information on people . For example , you could search for `` my friends who like Snow Patrol '' and it should then return with a list of all the people you need to unfriend immediately . You can get as specific as you like . For the time being , only those using ' U.S . English ' Facebook will be able to access the service , which may mean that U.K. users can also get involved if they do n't mind sacrificing a few `` u '' s to do so . After six months of testing the water , Facebook will then send it global . Probably just as well though . The New York Times claims that the feature is still a little buggy right now , struggling to get its head around synonymous phrases , for example . On its end , Facebook claimed that the service has improved thanks to early testing , with faster speed , better query understanding , more relevant results and an improved interface . The company said it 's working on even more improvements , such as easier topic search and discovery , including for posts and comments . What 's more , Graph Search mobile is on the horizon . We found the service worked just fine when we tried it out here in the States , getting eerily specific the more markers we searched for . Look for an automatic update rolling out now , U.S. English Facebookers , and let us know what you think of Graph Search so far .

After updating to Windows 8.1 , users noted that the OS 's Photos app seemed to have lost support for Facebook and Flickr , among other things . Last week , a Microsoft spokesperson with the handle CarmenZ addressed the changes on Microsoft 's Windows Community Forum . Read more : pCloud `` Thanks for the feedback , everybody , '' CarmenZ wrote . `` In Windows 8 , we wanted to provide a way for folks to view their photos on other services knowing there would be few ( if any ) apps in the store at launch that would do so . '' `` Now there are many apps in the store that offer ways to view photos on other services and soon there will even be a Facebook app from Facebook , '' the spokesperson continued . `` We 're confident Facebook will offer great ways to view and engage socially with photos on Facebook . We welcome Flickr to do the same . In addition , the People app still offers the ability to socially engage with your friends and even your own photos . '' In other words , Microsoft removed the functions from its Photos app because the official apps for those services might soon land in the Windows 8 app store . The official Windows 8 Photos app previously allowed users to access images from Facebook and Flickr directly within the app , much like Windows Phone 8 does , but no longer . Respondents in the Microsoft thread called the change a step backward , and from where we 're sitting it seems to be exactly that . It seems support for Skydrive , Microsoft 's cloud storage service , in the Photos app has been gimped as well , not to mention support for photos on network storage . We asked Microsoft to clarify its stance on the removal of these features , and a spokesperson provided the following statement : `` The new Photos app in the Windows 8.1 Preview includes several enhancements . This includes the ability to edit and organize your local photos in one seamless experience that is deeply integrated into your Windows device . While the new Photos app currently only includes those photos stored locally , our intent is to continue to provide richer functionality , enabling you to view , edit and manage more photos . However , we have nothing more to share on that right now . ''

Facebook is a constantly evolving platform , with personal accounts and company pages to fan pages and profiles for pets being generated and updated every day . But for all that , Facebook has been plagued by issues relating to hate speech , crude , violent , graphic and sexist content . It 's received many letters and complaints from individuals and organisations , such as from Women , Action and The Media . With all this offending content and complaints , numerous attempts at updating its policies and terms and conditions of use have been made by the social media giant . They have even hired people to look over content , flagging and deleting anything deemed questionable . But it all came to a head when advertisers began pulling ads from Facebook earlier this year because of complaints from users who found company ads next to pages that had abusive , graphic or controversial content . In response to companies pulling their ads , Facebook has introduced a `` New Review Policy for Pages and Groups '' . Starting from this week , Facebook will : `` … implement a new review process for determining which Pages and Groups should feature ads alongside their content . '' `` Prior to this change , a Page selling adult products was eligible to have ads appear on its right-hand side ; now there will not be ads displayed next to this type of content , '' the company said in its announcement . While at first pages will be monitored by humans , we ca n't imagine this to be a job that many will be jumping at . The company has put together a filter of sorts that will be implemented in the coming weeks , looking out for controversial and questionable pages or groups . Facebook has said that it `` … will build a more scalable , automated way to prevent and/or remove ads appearing next to controversial content . '' This kind of technology is n't new to the company , which already uses filters for spam , etc. , but this new automated system/filter/robot will be on the lookout specifically for pages and groups that show explicit , abusive and offensive content . It will be targeting `` any violent , graphic or sexual content ( content that does not violate our community standards ) . '' Using an algorithm to identify pornographic or graphic photographs is nothing new , but Facebook 's new automated system wo n't be problem proof . Last year , there was some controversy over the wrongful removal of pictures of women breastfeeding , although Facebook said that these images were removed after users had reported it . This will be a judgement call that Facebook 's automated system will have to take in to account . It will need to be able to decide on `` violent , graphic or sexual content '' based upon its context , and it may in many instances wrongfully conclude that a page or group is particularly `` controversial '' . Either way , if anyone sees content on Facebook that they find offensive , they should contact Facebook directly .

The official Facebook app for Windows Phone has finally arrived . The app , titled Facebook 5.0 , is available now through Microsoft 's Windows Phone 8 app marketplace . It 's the first official app from the social network to make it onto Microsoft 's mobile OS , but the 5.0 indicates that it includes improvements made in previous iterations on other platforms , like iOS and Android . Only third-party Facebook apps were available on WP8 handsets until now , and the official app looks like the only one without any glaring shortcomings . Go figure . The Windows Phone 8 Facebook app brings an altered look and functionality exclusive to the OS , fitting well with the tile-based aesthetic of Microsoft 's mobile UI . It was available previously in beta , and that beta Facebook app is still available in a separate listing from the official Facebook 5.0 . Word is the Facebook beta app will host new , untested features that may eventually make it into the official WP8 app . Both apps are available now for Windows Phone 7.5 in addition to Windows Phone 8 . Microsoft used its Build 2013 conference last week to announce that the official Facebook app would arrive shortly alongside a new Flipboard app .

Once again caught with its hand in the privacy cookie jar , a cash settlement over Sponsored Stories prompts Facebook to again make revisions to the social network 's data use policies . Facebook proposed new updates Thursday to two of its legal documents governing how the website collects and uses member data , and is giving its users a week to weigh in on the changes . The updates are in response to a recent U.S. court settlement over complaints that more than half a million Facebook users ' names and photos were used as part of sponsored advertisements without their permission . That gaffe is expected to cost Mark Zuckerberg 's social empire as much as $ 20 million ( roughly £12.9m / AU $ 22m ) , which ultimately amounts to $ 15 ( about £10 / AU $ 17 ) for each of the 614,000 users affected . Perhaps feeling the sting of legal justice , Facebook now proposes a number of changes to its Data Use Policy as well as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities which governs how the social network can use your content . In a Section-by-Section Summary of Updates posted to its website , Facebook makes it clear that users now `` give us permission to use your name , profile picture , content , and information in connection with commercial , sponsored , or related content ( such as a brand you like ) served or enhanced by us . '' The only exception to this appears to be users who have `` selected a specific audience for your content or information , '' but Facebook is under no obligation to share such revenue with its members in any event . The full list of proposed changes wo n't take effect for seven days , during which time Facebook users can offer their own colorful commentary on the revisions , suck it up and keep posting or choose to jump off of Zuck 's gravy train altogether . Check out the latest news on Verizon 's HTC One !

Facebook has revealed a plan to use members ' profile pictures as a means of identifying them across the site - enabling the company to improve its suggestions for photo tags to other users . The scheme , announced as the most noteworthy of Facebook 's latest proposed changes to its governing documents , would once again see the company expand its facial recognition tech . In the United States , but not in Europe ( where it is banned ) , the company scans photos users have already been tagged in to help make automatic suggestions when new photos are uploaded . If the new scheme is passed , the company would also be able to scan the user 's profile picture in order to enhance that often controversial process . The new wording of the privacy document reads : `` We are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by scanning and comparing your friend 's pictures to information we 've put together from your profile pictures and the other photos in which you 've been tagged . '' In regions where the facial recognition tech is permitted , users are already able to turn off the auto tagging suggestions , which in turn deletes the template of the user 's likeness , the site has built up . Facebook 's Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan said the improving facial recognition tech will assist users rather than hinder them . `` Now we are making it clear that moving forward we also want to use your profile photos as an additional input into the technology to better recognise you . The benefit in being tagged is that you know photos exist , '' she said . The proposed changes to the governing documents can be read in full at Facebook.com . Users can have their say before any go into effect .

Facebook has revealed that government agencies requested information on over 38,000 of its users in the first six months of 2013 . The vast majority of these came from the US government , which put in between 11- and 12,000 requests for data on up to 21,000 individuals - Facebook was legally required to comply in 79 % of cases . The UK , meanwhile , asked for a information 1,975 times , covering 2,337 Facebook users , while 68 % of these requests were fulfilled . Australia was only interested in 601 users and got 64 % of the information it wanted . The sudden transparency comes after Facebook was accused of being in cahoots with the NSA , passing user data on to the government agency without any proper policing in place - allegations that the social network has denied . Facebook 's General Counsel , Colin Stretch , wrote in a blog post : `` As we have made clear in recent weeks , we have stringent processes in place to handle all government data requests . `` We believe this process protects the data of the people who use our service , and requires governments to meet a very high legal bar with each individual request in order to receive any information about any of our users . '' Google and Twitter also publish how many government requests they receive twice yearly .

Users whose names and pictures were used in sponsored stories without giving their permission will get a $ 15 ( about £10 / AU $ 17 ) payout from Facebook . The amount has been approved by a US judge , and the bill will run to around $ 20 million ( about £12.9m / AU $ 22m ) in total for Facebook , which also has to cover court costs for the case . But before you start plotting what you 'll spend your new-found cash on , you 'll only get it if you were one of the 614,000 Facebookers who submitted a claim when Facebook emailed users to explain the situation earlier this year . A group of five Facebook users originally filed the action against the social network in 2011 , arguing that they had n't been given a way to opt out of having their names used in advertising on the site , nor received any financial compensation . The claims related to sponsored stories that include the line `` Kate Solomon likes [ Random brand ] '' which show up in your friends ' news feeds . While Judge Richard Seeborg noted that no claimants were `` harmed in any meaningful way '' ( hence the small payout ) , he conceded that Facebook has `` undisputedly violated the law . '' Facebook is also required to update its Statement of Rights to let users control how their details are used in the future .

Imagine you 're the head of a multi-billion dollar corporation with more money than most people could ever imagine . You look around the world , and you see abject poverty , and illness , and despair , and devastation . You think `` Jeez ! What these people need is Facebook ! '' Mark Zuckerberg did n't put it quite like that when he announced Internet.org , of course . `` Is connectivity a human right ? '' he asked , concluding that it is . As a result , Facebook is teaming up with Samsung , Qualcomm , Ericsson , Nokia , Opera and MediaTek under the banner of Internet.org , whose aim is to connect the rest of the world to Facebook . It 's significant that Facebook is the only content company : there 's no Microsoft , no Google , no Twitter , no telecoms networks , no industry bodies . There are two handset makers , an infrastructure supplier , two chip firms and a browser company , and Facebook . According to The New York Times , they will work together to make phone applications more efficient and make phones less power-hungry . It 's not about the money , says Zuckerberg , writing that `` it may not actually be profitable for us to serve the next few billion people for a very long time , if ever . '' Do n't believe a word of it . Facebook is n't a charity . Zuckerberg is right that internet access has beneficial effects , but this is n't about making the world a nicer place . It 's about playing nice for Wall Street . Facebook wants to be this century 's AOL , the first service people use when they get online and for many , the only service they use when they go online . Wall Street demands explosive growth from Facebook , and the more developed parts of the world are n't going to deliver that for much longer . Facebook is an enormous business , but it 's no longer growing enormously : as Venturebeat reports , its growth is slowing to single digits in highly developed countries - but in the Middle East , Africa and Asia the opportunities are enormous . If Internet.org can `` start to sustainably deliver on the promise of connectivity as a human right '' , create a situation where `` it becomes economically reasonable to offer free basic services to those who can not afford them '' and `` define which basic internet services should have free data '' - services such as `` messaging , social networks , search engines and Wikipedia '' - then everything will be brilliant . `` We 've already seen results where attaching free data for Facebook ... increases both phone sales profits and data plan profits . '' And Facebook numbers . Facebook Zero is already driving demand for broadband in Africa , the free product acting as a gateway drug for people who then want to see the pictures and cat videos everybody 's sharing ( but which are n't included in zero-rated data ) . This is good for the world , Zuckerberg says , because `` everyone will benefit from the increased knowledge , experience and progress we make from having everyone connected to the internet . '' And Facebook will benefit because as those markets develop , Facebook wo n't have to worry about competing with home-grown social networks : it 'll already have lock-in that network effects will make it very hard to overcome . This is n't about connectivity as a human right , and it is n't about making the world a better place : improved connectivity is a means to an end , not the ultimate goal . That goal should be obvious : Facebook wants to be this century 's AOL , the first service people use when they get online and for many , the only service they use when they go online . There 's nothing wrong with companies wanting to make money . It 's just a shame it has to be couched in happy clappy pseudo-humanitarian bullshit .
Facebook has announced a massive initiative to bring affordable internet to those around the world who are currently unable to get online – that 's 5 billion people . Internet.org marks a partnership between Facebook , Samsung , Ericsson , Nokia , Qualcomm , Opera , MediaTek and Ericsson to create a world completely connected by the internet , bringing the web to developing nations . So how will it work ? Currently Mark Zuckerberg says he only has a `` rough plan '' but one of the primary goals of the group initiative is to reduce the cost of delivering internet services on mobile phones . They 'll do this by making phone applications more simple , while improving mobile networks to make them broader so that they 're as data efficient as possible , according to The New York Times . Getting carriers and manufacturers to offer lower prices of access is also part of the plan . `` There are huge barriers in developing countries to connecting and joining the knowledge economy , '' said Zuckerberg in a statement . `` Internet.org brings together a global partnership that will work to overcome these challenges , including making internet access available to those who can not currently afford it . '' The Facebook CEO has set out his thinking in a document titled `` Is Connectivity a Human Right ? '' . Right now the key focus of the initiative seems to be on mobile devices given the continuing rise of mobile traffic . Oh , and we suspect Facebook will pick up a few new users along the way too .

A frustrated security expert sick of being ignored by Facebook 's people took to Mark Zuckerberg 's personal Facebook wall to report a security vulnerability that allows strangers to post on anybody 's wall . Unfortunately for Khalil Shreateh , he is n't eligible for the $ 500 bonus that you usually get for reporting a security flaw because he broke Facebook 's Ts & Cs by hacking its CEO 's profile . The bug has now been fixed , but here it is in video form , if you want to relive past glories : Post some blips on strangers ' Facebook walls , if you like .

Facebook is gearing up test a new service that would take some of the tediousness out of making payments on mobile apps , just by using their Facebook credentials . AllThingsD learned of the service , and Facebook today confirmed with the site that it will likely begin testing it next month . Facebook also sent TechRadar this statement : `` Facebook is working on a very small test that lets people populate their payment information already on file with Facebook into the checkout form of a mobile phone app when they are making a purchase . `` The app then processes and completes the payment with their existing payments provider . The test makes it easier and faster for people to make a purchase in a mobile app by simply pre-populating your payment information . It will be a very small test with 1-2 partners . '' As for details , AllThingsD reported users ' credit card information will be stored with Facebook , and making mobile payments will be as easy as logging into the social network . It 's important to point out that as it stands , the test looks to create a better mobile checkout experience , not take over payment processing . However , overtime , Facebook 's service could prove a competitor to services like PayPal . For now , though , Facebook is denying any such aims . `` We continue to have a great relationship with PayPal , and this product is simply to test how we can help our app partners provide a simpler commerce experience , '' the company 's statement read . `` This test does not involve moving the payment processing away from an app 's current provider . '' Of course , Facebook could just be playing the diplomat , so we 'll keep an eye on how the service unfolds and whether PayPal should consider finding new friends . The service 's success will hinge on popular apps adopting it at a rapid pace , and already one has signed up . Facebook 's test partner for the payments service is JackThreads , a men 's clothing site owned by Thrillist . According to AllThingsD , JackThreads and Facebook already have a good relationship , the app gets plenty of mobile purchases , and the demographic for JackThreads overlaps nicely with a group that 's already provided its credit card numbers to Facebook : gamers . In addition to simplifying mobile payments , the service will ostensibly provide Facebook with valuable information about its users ' purchasing habits , though it 's unconfirmed if and how Facebook will use that data .
A new study has found that using Facebook regularly could be making us feel blue . The main reason is FOMO - we feel lonelier than we otherwise would because Facebook makes it seem as though everyone else we know is out having a great time without us . `` The more people used Facebook the worse they subsequently felt , '' the researchers said , before concluding that `` the more participants used Facebook , the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time '' . So that 's cheery . It 's not an exact science though , so do n't give up on social networking just yet : other studies have found that using Facebook can make us feel good . It 's almost as though sometimes we feel good and sometimes we do n't and it 's more to do with our actual lives and not so much down to Facebook , is n't it ? Do n't be down : let blips cheer you up .

Exactly how famous do you have to be before Facebook will let you use its new VIP app that 's supposedly in testing ? A `` small group of famous people '' are apparently getting the early view of the app - but whether we 're talking Michelle-Williams-famous or Beyoncé-famous , nobody knows . Anyway , it just lets the great and the good keep an easy eye on their Facebook fans and get involved from a sensible distance . We do n't think it comes with a goody bag . You do n't need to be famous to enjoy TechRadar 's blips :

Turns out hashtags were only the beginning . Now , Facebook is testing another Twitterish staple : Trending Topics . The social network is trying out a feature on its mobile site that populates a topic other Facebookers are talking about , as reported byAllThingsD . Users can click on the topic , and up will pop information from friends talking about the subject , as well as comments and posts from people they are n't friends with . Trending Topics is currently in beta testing with a small number of U.S. users , Facebook said in a statement sent to TechCrunch . The feature is in very early testing , the statement noted , and the FB team will share more `` if we decide to roll it out more widely . '' The Facebook crew is n't just tracing Twitter 's footsteps today . The company is also expanding Graph Search , launching it for anyone who has U.S. English set as their language . So if you 've been dying to search for `` Friends of friends who live nearby and like playing tennis , '' and you 're a U.S. English speaker/reader/user today is your lucky day . Facebook also noted that it is starting to retire the `` who can look up my timeline by name '' setting . Hasta la vista , as they say .

At an event today , with TechRadar in attendance , Facebook revealed some of its processes on how it ranks the stories in your News Feed and announced it 's adding something called 'story bumping ' to how the feed works . Admitting that when Facebook started News Feed seven years ago , the ranking of stories was an almost manual process , the company explained that the process of bubbling relevant stories to the top of your feed has gone through a number of changes . According to Chris Cox , VP of product at Facebook , an algorithm is applied to stories that ranks them based on how many views , likes and shares a story has received . `` Shares are going to be more interested than comments , which are in turn more interesting and valuable than likes , and these are seen to more interesting than clicks , '' Cox explained . He went on to note that there is a constant battle when it comes to Facebook , with those that read posts and those that publish them . `` On the consumer side , there is some amount of attention that will be invested in News Feed and these people do n't want to miss anything important from a friend . `` On the other side , there are publishers wondering why their content is n't being seen all of the time . We are in the process of making sure that there is consistency . '' This consistency is ultimately down to Lars Backstrom , Engineer , News Feed Ranking , from Facebook who said about the current process : `` We are trying to create a personalised newspaper for users and customise the newsfeed experience for what they want to see . `` The model we currently use is a ranking process for stories , by taking all the stories when you last visited and assign them a score – the higher the score the better , the lower we might not show you at all . `` You want the best things above the fold [ before you have to scroll ] , that you will want to see then the others below . We think a lot on how you should see the most relevant content and that is by putting things at the top . '' The problem with this is that unseen stories are sometimes missed because of the algorithm . Backstrom revealed that the average users gets some 1,500 posts a day that have to be filtered through Facebook 's processes , ultimately meaning that older articles would tend to be missed . This is something that will change with story bumping . The service took numerous months and three engineers to perfect and has been beta tested by 80 percent of Facebook employees for a number of weeks . `` It is really hard for users to get back to old stories . You have to scroll through a whole lot of things to get to content you might have missed . `` So we thought about how we should fix this . And we decided to put older stories above the fold when you log on . `` Now we are not just taking the stories that are new but the stories that are new to the user . We have built a new service to keep track of what people have actually seen and have added this algorithm to our process . '' According to Backstrom , the beta test pushed stories read on the site to 70 percent - it is currently at 57 percent . The story bumping wo n't have anything to do with ads , according to Facebook , as it is an entirely separate system . The change wo n't affect the total stories in your feed , but will hopefully bring older content you have n't seen to you .

Facebook 's Graph Search has been turning up oddly specific results for several months now , but one feature it missed is the ability to search for things like posts and status updates . We think you can see where we 're going , but we 'll lay it out for you : Starting today , Facebook folk can plug in status updates , photo captions , check-ins and comments in the Graph Search bar , and voila , there those items are . As told by Facebook , users can search for topics they 're interested by entering something like `` Posts about Breaking Bad by my friends , '' posts about a city , place or a certain time , and posts users want to see again , accomplished with prompts like `` Posts I commented on '' or `` My posts from 2012 . '' There is a slight catch in that the feature is doing a slow roll , heading out to a small number of Graph Search users first . In other words , do n't be surprised if you ca n't look up `` Posts written at Machu Picchu '' just yet . Just like current Graph Search results , only content that 's shared with users will be visible when the updates go into affect . This includes posts shared publicly by people users are n't friends with . Facebook will digest any feedback and work to improve the updated Graph Search experience , and we 'll keep an ear out for a full release time frame . Graph Search recently opened for all who 've set U.S. English as their default language , so users outside the United States may be part of the initial roll-out group .

iOS 7 is Apple 's most drastic operating system redesign yet , so it 's only fitting apps would want to key into the new aesthetic too . Facebook , Twitter , Evernote and others all took cues from the flattened look of Apple 's new OS , releasing updates for in the App Store left and right today . On the whole , the made-over applications should fit right in with iOS 7 's non-skeuomorphic principles , though there are still shades of texture and depth . Most , however , fall in step with 7 's style . We 'll start with the big fish : Facebook released version 6.5 of its app , complete with `` an all-new look and feel for iOS 7 . '' You 're too kind , responded iOS 7 . While iOS 7 elements have slipped into Facebook 's app ( the skimmed down top section screams `` 7 '' ) , Facebook took it one step further and created an entirely new way to navigate on the iPhone . Most notably it placed the navigation bar along the bottom of the screen . Tapping here will pull up the News Feed , Requests , Messages , Notifications and More . `` More '' queues Timeline , groups , events and other info . What 's really dynamic , as reported by Engadget , is that as you pick between the five main tab options , the screen will automatically switch to whatever you 're looking at . The different pages will automatically save on each screen , so you can read a new message then pick up where you left off in your News Feed without having to scroll back through previously-viewed content . The More option will also remember where you 've been , turning it into a more customizable creature than simply giving you `` more '' of the options you do n't really want . The navigation changes are only coming to the iPhone , and while iPhones running iOS 6 and iOS 5 will support the updated app , some design elements will differ . Twitter meanwhile also retooled its app for iOS 7 , though the application is compatible with iOS 6 and iOS 5 just like Facebook . The core functions are largely the same , but Twitter has cut down the top tool bar , sticking with a basic blue and white scheme and line-drawn looking icons . Evernote took , well , note of the `` clean , simplicity of iOS 7 '' in version 7.0 of its app , plus added some navigation functions like jumping from your most recent note back to the home screen . There 's also a new audio recorder that should make it easier to listen and type at the same time . The whole app has been stripped down , making accessing main Evernote functions markedly quicker . eBay , Kindle , Foursquare , Pocket , Yahoo Weather , Pandora ( as iTunes Radio releases ... interesting ) and plenty more took advantage of iOS 7 's release to tinker with their iOS apps , all of which you can check out in the App Store right now .

Top Facebook executives have dished out free advice to start-ups on how to build , grow and promote their mobile and web apps by tapping in to Facebook 's vast quantities of users and data . Yesterday 's seminars at fbSTART London ran for five hours and were delivered by some of the company 's leading employees , including original news feed creator Andrew 'Boz ' Bosworth . They centred on ways that start-ups can use Facebook Platform , the company 's framework for third-party app developers , to take advantage of emerging opportunities presented by the social networking giant 's growing mobile user base . According to Facebook , the service now has 24 million daily active users in the UK , with 20 million of those accessing the service on a smartphones or tablet . It says that users access its service an average of 14 times per day on a mobile device . Eric Edge , Head of Marketing Communications EMEA at Facebook , said : `` Facebook is at the centre of the shift to mobile , a claim we could n't have made 12 , eight or even seven months ago . `` Today we can because we know that one out of every four minutes on a mobile is spent with Facebook or Instagram . `` Facebook is about giving people the ability to access information , people and things that they care about in a way that 's convenient to them , and that happens to be mobile . '' Facebook Platform provides start-ups with tools designed to help extend the reach of their social apps and content , which in turn provides them with more data to target potential customers and run customised marketing campaigns . `` One out of every four minutes on a mobile is spent with Facebook or Instagram . '' They include social plugins that let people 'Like ' content on websites , Requests that display invitations that users can choose to accept or refuse , and log in forms that can be embedded into apps that allow them to log in using a Facebook account . The day 's speakers frequently referenced Parse , Facebook 's cloud-based platform that it claims removes the pain of managing servers by allowing developers to store their data , users and notifications in the cloud . Julian Codorniou , Director of Facebook Platform EMEA , told TRPro that start-ups should use such tools to drive organic growth ( people sharing content ) and paid growth ( such as advertisements ) to get their apps and content displayed on more users ' news feeds . He said : `` Distribution is the most important thing as when a user is engaging with your application , they 'll bring their friends to the app too , which is how the gaming companies operate . `` Start-ups should also consider making mobile app install ads and look at what their competitors are doing when asking the question of how they can get their content on news feed . '' Zaggora founder and CEO Malcolm Bell told TRPro that his sports clothing company has evolved along with Facebook Platform . He said : `` While it was all about organic communication and getting people excited about fitness products in the early days , now we find that we can drive a very strong direct response message and an insane amount of traffic at a massive scale from Facebook . `` That 's down to it giving us the opportunity to advertise in 50 different countries on a daily basis and reach people that frankly we would never have been able to reach otherwise . '' He added : `` We love to try new features , whether that 's the format of a post on newsfeed , the new link ads that they have , or targeting capabilities such as partner categories or forming audiences from existing customers .

Twitter can not follow Facebook of bragging and greediness ahead of its arrival on the stock market according to the Saudi prince that already owns a big chunk of the micro-blogging platform . Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal invested a not-insignificant $ 300 million ( c.£188m/AU $ 321m ) in Twitter back in 2011 , and he told Reuters that it could well avoid the mistakes of another social network . `` In my discussion with Mr Costolo and the management of Twitter , I cautioned them to be very careful and not to repeat the mistakes of Facebook . `` The lessons are not to brag too much , do n't be greedy - I mean price it right and be realistic . '' `` There could be a good surprise for the market , where Twitter revenues coming from mobile compared to fixed devices are way ahead of what Facebook came with at the time of the IPO , '' added Alwaleed . Facebook 's IPO ( initial public offering ) brought a landslide of criticism , something that Twitter 's founders will be desperate to avoid . Alwaleed 's advice will no doubt be heeded , but his statement about mobile revenue is interesting as well . With mobile devices becoming the dominant computing platform , wringing the most amount of money out of them is key to many big social networks ' future .

Facebook is testing auto-playing video clips within the News Feeds of a small sample of its iOS and Android app users . Initially , the company said , only videos posted by individuals , musicians and bands would automatically play whether users wish to view them or not . The relevant videos will play silently , unless users tap the clip in order to expand to full screen and , in-turn , activate the audio . The announcement on Facebook 's Newsroom blog comes amid speculation the company is plotting to integrate TV-style , 15-second video commercials into the News Feeds of users . In the post , the company said it was exploring how to expand the feature to marketers , which is probably code for : `` Sorry guys we 're going to be filling up your feeds with loads of ads really soon . '' Facebook Product Manager Kelly Mayes wrote : `` We 're doing this to make sure we create the best possible experience . Over time , we 'll continue to explore how to bring this to marketers in the future . ''

The Facebook Home lockscreen is due for a makeover , though when is still up in the air . Speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference today , Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed that more content beyond feed of Facebook is on the way . One of the software 's monthly update will at some point bring with it Instagram and `` other social content , '' presumably from third-party sources , to the Home lockscreen . Zuckerberg also admitted that Home has n't been adopted as fast as he would have thought , though he `` fully believes that people will want it over time . '' We 've got plenty more blip content , no update required .

Facebook announced the release of two new APIs today that allow `` selected news organizations '' to integrate posts and data from the social network directly into their content . The new tools allow these organizations to do anything from simply displaying a real time feed of posts related to a certain topic , to breaking down social conversations by demographics like age , sex , and location . Facebook provided some examples , like a certain program delving into how many people are discussing a certain topic on Facebook , where they 're located , and the age and gender groups among which topic is most popular . Currently , only Buzzfeed , CNN , NBC 's Today Show , BSkyB , Slate , and Mass Relevance have access to the new APIs , but Facebook said it will announce more partners `` in the coming weeks . '' Facebook highlighted its apparent popularity in today 's announcement . For example , the social network claims that the NFL season kick-off last week garnered 20 million likes , comments , and shares by more than 8 million Facebook users . In addition an infographic states that 88 million to 100 million Facebook users log in during the `` primetime hours '' between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. every day in the U.S. alone . And 245 million people discussed , shared , and liked the Super Bowl in February . Facebook 's new tools should allow news organizations and the company 's other partners to leverage and explore that activity in new ways . Facebook said it 's been rolling out products , tools and services `` aimed at surfacing the public conversations happening on Facebook . '' These include hashtags , embedded posts , and trending topics , according to the social network , as well as the tools announced today . The tools available to Facebook 's select partners today include the Keyword Insights API and the Public Feed API , though based on the language in the announcements it seems other , similar tools will become available in the future .

Facebook announced nearly a week ago that some sizeable shifts are coming to its privacy policy , but now the social network has been forced to delay those changes . The proposed policy changes were precipitated by a recent $ 20 million ( about £12.9m , AU $ 22m ) settlement over complaints that Facebook users ' names , photos and personal info were used in ads without their permission . Consumer watchdog groups say the proposed updates would make it easier for Facebook to do so in the future , and they 've petitioned the FTC to block the social network 's plans . The FTC has been silent so far , but Facebook says the updates change nothing and simply clarify the policy that 's been in place all along . Facebook 's new privacy policy language makes it clear that users `` give [ Facebook ] permission to use your name , profile picture , content and information in connection with commercial , sponsored , or related content ( such as a brand you like ) served or enhanced by us . '' It appears that the new policy makes it more difficult than ever for users to opt out as well , and states that parents and guardians of users under 18 consent by default . Facebook says that 's what the policy 's always been , and it 's just the language that 's changing now . Nevertheless , it delayed the adoption of the new policy so that it can take users ' feedback into account . `` We are taking the time to ensure that user comments are reviewed and taken into consideration to determine whether further updates are necessary and we expect to finalize the process in the coming week , '' the social network said in a statement . We contacted Facebook to get their full take on the situation , and a spokesperson said that this is n't technically a delay . The Facebook rep said that users had until Sept. 5 to submit feedback , and that Facebook is now reviewing that feedback as planned .

When Peter Molyneux speaks , people tend to listen . But like any rockstar icon the man behind Populous and Black & White is no stranger to dividing opinion . Just take his recent comments on the Xbox One . After leaving Lionhead Studios and Microsoft last year , Molyneux moved over to join former Lionhead CTO Tim Rance at 22Cans - a far cry from the world of Fable - where he 's now focusing on projects smaller but arguably more ambitious . `` Being an indie gamer means you can be completely experimental , '' he tells TechRadar . `` You can take risks that are very very hard to take when you 're a big studio of hundreds of people and it 's costing thousands of pounds a minute to run a studio . '' Take Curiosity - What 's Inside the Cube ? A social experiment more than a game , the app invited participants to tap away at a giant cube over months until one lucky person hit the middle . That individual was given the opportunity to play the role of God in the studio 's upcoming game Godus . Godus is a Populus for a new decade and set to launch on PC , Mac and mobile with a Steam beta release on September 13 . The civilisation creation simulator will , Molyneux believes , reinvent the God genre that he himself created all those years ago . And he reckons that mobile is the place for this to happen . `` The indies are the ones that are really going to expand with mobile , '' he says . `` At the moment the larger publishers have a toe in the mobile space and the smartphone space , but they 're not fully embracing it . They 're not saying to themselves 'our future is going to be mobiles ' . `` So there 's this schizophrenic nature about development at the moment . 'Should I go for the console ? Should I go for the traditional retail model where you make the game , you release the game - within an hour of releasing the game you 've made back your development costs and within a week you 're in profit ? ' `` 'Or shall I throw that idea of a potential huge pile of money coming from retail away and embrace mobile ? ' And unless you embrace something , unless you immerse yourself in something , it 's very hard to innovate and find the love in something which instills those new experiences . '' Embrace it fully . Got it . But as Molyneux adds , `` If you 're approaching mobile and saying ' I 've done this game on consoles , I 'll do that game again on touch ' , that generally speaking wo n't work . '' Godus may hope to reinvent the God game genre but perhaps we 're all still waiting on something much bigger . `` There is inevitably going to be some game that touches the whole world , '' says Molyneux , though of course he is n't so bold as to claim that Godus will be the one to do this despite his habit of over-hyping . `` We 're talking about a game that becomes a fad for tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people . It 's the equivalent of a gaming Twitter of a gaming Facebook . That is definitely going to happen and it 's going to happen on mobile . `` I think the iteration speed of mobile is changing so fast that us in the gaming industry are having to sprint to keep up , and it 's going to continue to evolve and that evolution means inevitably that gaming is going to be with us all the time . '' We 're not far away from this big event , according to Molyneux , who thinks we 'll see this happen within the next decade . The likes of Farmville have changed the way we perceive gaming and this will be key to the next big thing .
The Guardian 's Media 100 is out today and Google 's co-founder Larry Page is no longer the biggest player in the media : you are . Well , you , me and everybody else on the internet are in at number one , as UK newspaper the Guardian believes that eye-witness accounts of the Boston Marathon bombings and the horrifying events in Woolwich , London prove that anyone with a cameraphone and access to Twitter can define the media landscape of today . This is according to the panel of judges who noted : `` The internet economy is bigger than education , healthcare or construction , growing faster than in any other country in the G20 , and what drives that is consumers . `` Both as the audience and creators of content , it 's all about people power . '' The idea of having the general public win a leauge such as the Media 100 is n't a new one : Time pulled the same stunt off way back in 2006 , when it crowned 'you ' its person of the year in 2006 . Despite us topping the league tablet , the Guardian 's list , as you would expect it is stuffed with tech luminaries . Alongside Larry Page at number 2 , Twitter 's Dick Costolo is in at number 4 , Facebook 's Sheryl Sandberg at 5 , Apple 's Tim Cook at 6 and Amazon 's Jeff Bezos is in at number 7 . Netflix 's Reed Hasting 's is just outside the top 20 at 22 and Spotify 's Daniel Ek and Yahoo 's Melissa Myer are further down the league at 45 and 57 respectively .

It 's bad enough that Facebook openly sold user photos and information to sponsors . Now a new privacy breach is potentially on its way as the company is testing technology that can track minute user activity , even down how a someone 's cursor is behaving on the site . Facebook analytics chief Ken Rudin revealed the test during an interview with the Wall Street Journal , and said the social network may significantly expand the data it collects on its users . The tracking tech extends to measuring things like how long someone holds their cursor over a certain part of the Facebook website and whether a user 's News Feed is visible on their desktop or mobile device . Rudin told the Journal that this information could be added to the company 's data analytics warehouse , where Facebook could use it to better gauge product development ( like implementing a redesign ) and create more targeted advertising . Facebook collects two kinds of data , demographic and behavioral , according to the Journal . Demographics documents things like where you live or went to school , while behavioral keeps tabs on your social interactions with friends and likes in real-time . Rudin said the info collection tests could generate burgeoning behavioral data for the social network . The tests are part of a larger technology testing program , and it wo n't be for a few more months until Facebook decides whether the data makes the cut . Naturally Facebook 's plan raises issues of privacy protection , though it would n't be the first company to collect such small user activity info . Image repository Shuttershock uses Hadoop to analyze even the tiniest interactions , like how long a user lingers over an image before deciding to buy it . Privacy has been a controversial topic for Facebook in the past , and the company has already settled one $ 20 million ( about £12.9m , AU $ 22m ) settlement over the use of Facebook users ' names , photos and personal info in ads without their permission . How much protection can be afforded a cursor hover is n't as cut and dry , but we 'll keep an ear out for further developments .

China , India and Facebook . If you go by the numbers , Facebook ( again ) has enough users to be the world 's third largest country . In reporting its Q3 2013 financials , the company boasted its monthly active users hit 1.19 billion as of September 30 . That 's an 18 % increase year-on-year . Last quarter , Facebook notched up 1.15 billion monthlies . So yeah , the social network has been populous for awhile now . More importantly for the `` mobile first '' company , Facebook registered staggering mobile numbers . According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the company 's earnings call , 48 % of people who use Facebook on a daily access it entirely on mobile . In fact , web usage numbers declined for the first time last quarter , albeit only slightly . Mobile monthly active users number 874 million strong , a huge leap of 45 % from the same time last year . On average there were 507 million mobile daily active users scrolling through News Feeds and posting statuses during the quarter . And if you do n't think ads are here to stay or that they wo n't grow more pervasive on mobile , get your head out of the sand . Zuckerberg said 49 % of its $ 2.02 billion ( about £1.2b , AU $ 2.12b ) revenue came from the platform . This was the company 's first two billion dollar quarter , by the way . Zuck would n't bite on answering when we 'd see video ads in our feeds , but said the presence of video on Instagram has `` been very positive so far . '' Facebook is taking its time rolling out auto-play ads he said , as the company wants it to be `` a positive thing '' for users . Quick Insta-caveat - the photo-centric site has 150 million monthly active users , its parent company reported . One negative for Facebook was that , as far as it can tell , teen users have taken a dive . It 's hard to be totally accurate , CFO David Ebersman said , as people self-report and therefore can lie about their age , but the company 's own metrics have found younger daily active users dropping off . Facebook is doing fine , but it may need to re-think its cool factor for the under-18 set .

The list of potential BlackBerry suitors grew by one today thanks to whispers from `` people familiar with the matter . '' According to sources of the Wall Street Journal , Facebook ( yes , Facebook ) met with execs from BlackBerry last week . The folks from the hard-luck hardware maker reportedly jetted to California to get a read on the social network 's interest in putting down an offer for the Canadian company . That 's about all there is on the matter , and it 's unclear if Facebook is serious about bidding beyond taking the meeting . At first glance a deal between the savvy Facebook and sapped-out BlackBerry sounds doubtful , but if the cards fall into place , it could make a heap of sense . Many consider the next logical step for Facebook is to develop its own branded hardware , and having BlackBerry 's patents and assets would be a massive step towards making this happen . The HTC First was a Facebook phone of sorts , but owning BlackBerry would give Facebook the chance to go whole hog . CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called developing a handset `` the wrong strategy '' for the company , but statuses , as it were , can change . The Journal speculated Facebook would be most interested in BlackBerry patents covering security-network technology and smartphone components . BlackBerry is reportedly open to selling parts of its business . Facebook could also be keen on the sizzling BlackBerry Messenger , which has raked in 20 million users on Android and iOS in one week . The upsides are legitimate , though Facebook would have to deal with BlackBerry 's limp image . The company reportedly has no debt , which is big check in the plus column . We 'll keep an ear out for further developments .
Facebook is upping its messaging game in a bid to win you over . The social media site announced that staring today a select amount of Android devices will see a new Facebook Messenger system - one that is faster , easier on the eyes and best of all , provides more functions . Facebook 's main aim is a better `` mobile-to-mobile '' system where it can stack up more competitively against other messaging clients like WhatsApp . The good news for FB is that it may actually succeed in this as the changes seem to drastically improve the Messenger experience . The biggest and perhaps best change is how Facebook Messenger now lets you use the system to text everyone you know , like that friend who refuses to give in and get Facebook . Confirming phone number seems to be the only obstacle to chatting with contacts . To make texting faster , the lightening bolt Messenger icon will let you know which friend is also using the mobile app , allowing messages to be sent and received instantly . The icing on the cake is the new color scheme attached to the revamped app - Messenger is now dressed up in a new blue hue to help you better differentiate between Facebook apps . TechRadar asked the social networking giant for info on a wider release for more devices , but we were told the app is being tested with a limited amount of people with it coming to `` everyone on iOS and Android in the coming weeks .

The invasion of TV-style , auto-playing video ads within Facebook has been delayed until 2014 , according to reports . The commercial interruption was reportedly planned for the summer , but now All Things D 's sources say the roll out wo n't be before the new year . According to the report , the delay is due to Facebook 's fears that the introduction of video ads , which will play automatically , will turn off its user base . Sources say more internal discussions will now take place as to how to integrate the videos , pleasing shareholders with a significant revenue stream , while not upsetting members too much . Not a huge amount is known about how long , prominent or frequent the videos will be , but it is thought audio will be silenced , unless turned up by the user . Earlier this week , Facebook-owned Instagram revealed video and photo ads will be rolled out in the United States starting next week .

Sorry Instagram users , but the grace period following Facebook 's buyout is all but over . Ads are invading imminently and today we got our first glimpse at what we can expect from the commercial interruption . In a post on the Instagram blog , the photo sharing app said photos and videos marked as 'Sponsored ' will start to appear in feeds in the US next week , beginning with a small number of brands already using the app . The company says it is encouraging advertisers to be creative and engaging with their posts , while a FAQ post on its website says the posts will remain in 'the spirit of the community . ' That could mean a number of things , but it 's likely the ads will have some sort of faux artistic merit and deploy the famous filters , frames and blurring tools . Interestingly , the company will tap into a user 's Facebook likes and their basic profile information to determine which ads will display on that individual 's Instagram feed . However , those who are n't connected through Facebook wo n't avoid Instagram ads . The company will make use of previous Insta-likes or , failing that , just throw stuff at your wall and see what sticks . `` We want to show ads from businesses that are interesting to you , and to do that we will use information about what you do on Instagram and Facebook [ our parent company ] , '' the company said . `` For instance , this might include the people you follow and the photos and videos you like on Instagram , and your interests and other basic info on Facebook . '' In somewhat better news , users will also be able to hide ads from their feed ( not without seeing them first , of course ) and offer Instagram some feedback on why they do n't want to see anymore like it . In its blog post the company wrote : `` If you see an ad that does n't interest you , you can tap the '… ' below it to hide it and provide feedback about what you did n't like . This will help us show you more interesting ads in the future . ''

Update : All is restored in the Facebook-verse . According to a Facebook statement sent our way , an issue arose while the site was performing `` some network maintenance , '' causing the status and comment calamity `` for a brief period of time . '' The issue was resolved `` quickly '' , the statement continued , and everything is 100 % back to normal . The company apologized for any inconvenience , and left it at that . Now you can stop doing actual work and start posting comments on your friends ' `` OMG sooo fun ! # bestweekendever '' photos . We wo n't judge . Original article ... While you can still access Facebook and browse profiles , many users can not post statuses and comments on Facebook at the moment . There 's no information yet about what 's causing the posting downtime but Facebook has confirmed that `` we are aware that some people are having problems posting to Facebook and we 're looking into it . '' That 's the official word from Facebook 's PR spokesperson Iain Mackenzie as a frenzy of tweets bemoan the fact that posting statuses and comments on the social network is a no-go . But what if someone 's baby does something adorable ? What if someone has a pithy remark to make about your new profile picture ? Let 's hope Facebook 's working like the clappers to get this fixed . We 're not sure how long we can go without .
Google will be partnering Facebook to sell ads on the social network which may mean that you start seeing more varied marketing messages in your news feed . But you wo n't be seeing ads for Google itself on the social network , as Google will be selling space on Facebook to its existing advertisers who already buy space on Google 's sites . They 'll be using bespoke bidding software - Google 's DoubleClick Bid Manager for Facebook 's Ad Exchange ( FBX ) - to buy premium spots in an auction style . Given that Facebook is a key competitor to Google 's own social networking efforts - the oft-abused Google+ - it 's interesting to see the two companies working together . Google 's senior product manager for Doubleclick , Payam Shodjai , explained that Google is keen to partner with more companies because `` a rising tide lifts all boats '' - so when one of them makes money , they all make money . This partnership could also mean that ads purchased through DoubleClick will land on Facebook Home , that is if the OS-like overlay survives . And with Facebook purchasing Instagram , we could see the fruits of this partnership landing in your filtered-photos stream in the near future with Instagram ads on their way . Via Cnet

The ability to hide your Facebook profile from someone who searches you by name just changed to `` it 's complicated . '' The social networking company announced today that its seldom used `` Who can look up my timeline by name ? '' feature will be gone in the coming weeks . `` The search setting was removed last year for people who were n't using it , '' reminded Michael Richter , Facebook 's chief privacy officer , in a blog post today . `` For the small percentage of people still using the setting , they will see reminders about it being removed in the coming weeks . '' Facebook noted that its `` Who can look up my timeline by name ? '' privacy feature could create a false sense of security . It did n't stop anyone from reaching your profile when your name popped up in a story or on a mutual friend 's timeline . It also spurred plenty of puzzled `` I ca n't find you on Facebook '' remarks when two people were legitimately attempting to become friends on the social network . `` The setting made Facebook 's search feature feel broken at times , '' said Richter . `` People told us that they found it confusing . '' This false sense of security is being replaced by controls on individual posts that you share , which Facebook calls `` the best way to control what people can find about you . '' In an effort to better inform its one billion users of this , Facebook plans to remind everyone that public posts can be seen by everyone , including people they may not know . This warning message will be supplemented with a notice of how to change the audience settings for each post . It also suggests visiting the privacy settings page within your Facebook account to quickly limit what you 've shared in the past . There 's certainly more control over individual posts , but complete anonymity on Facebook is going out as a more populated Graph Search comes in .

Windows Phone users have awoken to a new Facebook update , which allows them to clean house of all of those annoying sort-of-friends , from the comfort of their smartphone . The Facebook 5.1 update adds the ability to unfriend contacts from the application as well as 'unlike ' content they have previously liked directly from the app . Users can also benefit from inline @ tagging of friends within posts . Another useful addition is multiple photo uploads directly from the app , as well as the ability to attach photos to messages , a feature that has been available to iOS and Android users for some time . The app also promises navigation and performance improvements . Facebook 5.1 for Windows Phone , which now offers support for 19 languages , is available to download from the Windows Store now .

Remember Facebook Home ? It 's the Android overlay that puts the social network front and center , but today it was feeling hospitable and decided to let others walk through its front door . One of Facebook Home 's selling points is that users can swipe through the lock screen to see photos from their Facebook news feeds , and starting today posts and pics from Instagram , Pinterest , Tumblr and Flickr can be viewed there as well . `` Today you can view more of the content you care about on your lock screen , '' Facebook Engineering Manager Tom Alison wrote on Facebook 's brief announcement message . `` When you wake up your phone , swipe through photos and posts from Flickr , Pinterest , Tumblr and Instagram , in addition to Facebook , '' he continued . The feature will begin testing within the Facebook for Android beta program before heading out for all . According to Facebook , users need only connect their accounts for the other networks with Home to begin seeing items from those services on their lock screens . Users can change what content appears on the lock screen in the settings menu . `` Connecting apps to Home is just one more way to see the content that you care most about the moment you wake up your phone , '' Facebook Product Designer Francis Luu said in a video explaining the new features . This addition to Facebook Home was promised last month , when Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Instagram and other services would soon be added to the Home lock screen . Zuckerberg also admitted that users have not been quick to embrace Facebook Home , but he believes that will change `` over time . '' That sentiment has been repeated by others at Facebook , including Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg , who said last May that Facebook Home 's journey to success `` will be a long road . ''

Facebook has decided that Twitter is having far too much fun with television and has announced it is getting in on the action too . From this week , it will begin sending data to US networks on the shows that are generating the most chatter on the social network – whether it is through comments , likes or shares . The idea is that Facebook is currently sitting on a massive pile of TV data that is waiting to be mined by the networks . This marks yet another shift in the way TV is monitored . While services such as Nielsen are important to finding out the popularity of television shows , networks are increasingly looking to social to figure out who is watching what . And considering the recent Breaking Bad finale broke all Twitter records , with 1.24 million tweets in the US sent during the show 's end , current TV watching metrics are starting to look more than a little stale . Facebook knows this and will combat Nielsen 's team-up with Twitter with its own reports . Speaking to the Wall Street Journal about the new reports , Daniel Slotwiner , head of Facebook 's measurement team , said : `` The conversation is being generated by a group that is much more representative of the general population . `` That means we should have a better signal as it relates to ratings . '' Facebook and Twitter are n't the only ones tapping into TV . Just this week , TechRadar revealed Gracenote 's plans to audio-sync its second screen mobile experiences to the TV shows you are watching . There 's also Shazam who is going big on television . The service talked exclusively to TechRadar about its take on TV , with its chief product officer , Daniel Danker , explaining : `` What we learned was that 85 % of Shazam 's users , Shazamed television . So , we have started adding calls to actions on programmes and to adverts . You are going to see a lot more of this too . '' Facebook is hoping its broader demographic and bigger numbers will be enough to combat Twitter 's real-time social TV push .

Facebook is reportedly testing a feature that would allow users to save web links to catch up with at a more convenient time . The feature , spotted by the MyTechSkool blog , mimics popular mobile apps like Instapaper and Pocket , by allowing users to place interesting articles or posts in a folder to pick up again at their convenience . It is apparently being a limited number of mobile app users , who 're required to click a bookmark next to stories on the News Feed in order to save them to a folder within the Facebook apps menu . Presumably the saved file would be synced back to the Facebook.com website and the user 's other mobile apps where they can pick up the saved articles , regardless of which device they 're using . Facebook is always looking for ways to keep users coming back to the site and engaging for longer while they do . Allowing users to save popular items , rather than opening them in the web browser and bookmarking or sending to Pocket and Instapaper seems to be an easy win in that department . When asked to comment on the existence of the feature , a Facebook spokesperson told AllThingsD : `` We 're constantly testing new features , but we have nothing further to share at this time . ''

In early November , it was announced that photo sharing service Snapchat had turned down a Facebook buyout worth a staggering $ 3 billion . Many observers thought that $ 3 billion was an incredible sum and a massive overvaluation of the social service . But many more had a simpler question : what the hell was Snapchat ? Snapchat is what Facebook used to be : the hip young kid on the block . As Facebook 's early adopters age , their offspring increasingly want social spaces of their own . Facebook famously began as a college social network , but these days it caters for an older age group . The biggest growth in usage is among salt-and-pepper-haired baby boomers , and the early adopters have long since grown up , settled down and filled everybody 's News Feeds with photos of their kids . Teens are still important to Facebook . ComScore reckons around one-fifth of Facebook 's British users are aged between 15 to 24 , while the Pew American Life Project reports that 77 % of online teens use the site . But it seems that Facebook may be becoming less important to teens who may have profiles but who do their networking elsewhere . In October , Facebook 's Chief Financial Officer reported that Facebook was seeing a significant decline in the daily usage of its younger teen users - a remark that gave investors a heart attack . Piper Jaffray 's semi-annual survey of teens would have given them a few more . A year ago 42 % of teens told researchers that Facebook was their most important social network ; six months ago that had fallen to 33 % , and now it 's 23 % . Teens are still networking , it 's just that increasingly they do n't do it where their parents , all their peers and the odd potential employer can see them . While the grown-ups share baby photos , inspirational quotes and urban myths on Facebook , younger users are waxing lyrical on WhatsApp , kicking back on Kik and sharing selfies on Snapchat . Snapchat is often characterised as the social network for sexting , but the appeal is more nuanced than that That 's partly because for many teens , Facebook missed the mobile boat . Teens are a phone-first demographic , not PC-first like their parents , and apps such as Snapchat work brilliantly on mobile . Facebook has since filled the gaps , first with its blatant Snapchat clone Poke in late 2012 and more recently with the updates to its standalone Facebook Messenger app . But by the time Facebook decided to take on Snapchat the newer service already had a huge audience . It shared its billionth photo in November 2012 . Snapchat is often characterised as the social network for sexting , but the appeal is more nuanced than that . The promise that what you post wo n't hang around forever ( more or less ) or fall into the wrong hands encourages fast , funny and quickly-forgotten sharing of what you 're doing , thinking or watching right now . Ephemeral sharing is n't the only attraction . Parents and older relatives do n't use it . Pew Internet found that while 26 % of under-30s used Snapchat , the numbers of over-30s were negligible - and until recently it 's largely flown under the radar , so there was little danger of parents attempting to connect with or follow their children on it . As a result Snapchat has seen explosive growth , and in November it reported daily sharing of more than 400 million images . That 's more than Facebook and Instagram combined , and the average Snapchat user now sends more snaps than SMS . That 's impressive , but it 's nothing compared to WhatsApp . By June of this year it was processing 27 billion messages a day . It 's the most popular messaging app in the UK , and it has more than 350 million monthly active users worldwide : that 's bigger than Twitter ( 232 million monthly active users ) and more than one-quarter of Facebook . WeChat is doing big numbers too : while its audience is largely in China , it now has more than 100 million registered user accounts from outside China .

Snapchat reportedly rejected a buyout offer from Facebook . Here 's an exclusive look at how it went down : Facebook 's five top lawyers smirk as they slide a slip of heavy-weight paper across a walnut boardroom table . Overachieving 23-year-old Snapchat co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel leans forward , picks the paper up and casually unfolds it . There 's a pause and all the carefully temperature-controlled air seems to go out of the room . Spiegel snorts quietly , stands up , buttons his smart-casual sports jacket the way he 's seen lawyers do it on TV and strides through the heavy double doors , tossing the paper over his left shoulder as he goes . The paper flutters down to the varnished table and the number on it slowly comes into focus : $ 3,000,000,000 neatly printed in black ink , each zero a smiling ghost . As the slip comes to rest , it bursts into a bright flame - just for a second - and then whoosh . It 's gone . The lawyers shift uncomfortably in their pressed Tom Ford suits . Zuckerberg is not going to like this . And now for other technology news stories represented in the style of bad teleplays :
Facebook has announced that the Android beta testing of its refreshed Messenger app has come to a close and the new version is available to download on iOS and Android devices . It should come as welcome news as the limited beta had an appealing iOS 7-friendly look and added the ability to message real-life contacts who are n't on your Facebook friends list . `` Now you can text your phone contacts , even if you 're not Facebook friends , '' wrote the social networking company in today 's release notes for the app . `` It 's easy to add new contacts - just enter a phone number . '' Facebook 's focus on a `` reliable mobile-to-mobile messaging experience '' means that users wo n't have to open up other chat programs like SMS and WhatsApp to message non-Facebook friends . The in-app ability to send a Facebook message , text , initiate a phone call , view previously sent photos and browse the contact 's timeline puts a lot more information at a user 's fingertips . The redesigned Messenger is also faster and feels more lightweight than its previous iteration . Although Facebook is no longer trying to completely co-op SMS conversations on Android , it still includes the convenient chat heads circles that can pop up throughout Google 's mobile ecosystem . All of this makes for more instantaneous communication . With Google integrating SMS into Hangouts and Apple having done the same with those highly encrypted iMessages , costly SMSs may be sending SOS messages and not much else .

Do n't worry , it 's not just you : Facebook was struggling for some people as pages and profiles fail to load . Update : Facebook has sent us this statement on the matter : `` Earlier today , we experienced an issue that prevented some people from loading Timeline or Pages content for a brief period of time . We resolved the issue quickly , and content is back to normal . We 're sorry for any inconvenience we may have caused . '' Reports on Twitter , DownRightNow.com and the fact that we could n't load our very own TechRadar Facebook page confirmed that something was afoot . It 's not the first time in recent memory that Facebook has gone down - in October people were n't able to post statuses or comments for several hours . We 're still not sure how we all got through that one . It could be that Facebook had a bit of a wobble because it 's rolling out new thumb-less like buttons . We 'll keep you posted on any new info Facebook shares .

Shares of Twitter , the popular micro blogging platform , jumped by more than 73 % to around $ 45.10 by midday Thursday , its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange . The NYSE 's session was opened on behalf of Twitter by Patrick Stewart , better known as Captain Jean-Luc Picard from the Star Trek series . He was joined by a 9-year-old girl who started a charity that makes use of the site . At one point , Twitter shares had soared by as much as 92 % . It was by all means a rousing success for a company with an IPO it wanted to keep low-key ( you know , after the whole Facebook debacle 18 months ago ) . The company was initially valued at $ 18.1 billion when Twitter priced its shares at $ 26 late Wednesday , but the new value puts it at $ 30 billion . That 's more than LinkedIn ( $ 24 billion ) , but about 30 % of Facebook 's valuation . The 7-year-old entity has more than 230 million monthly active users and will be closely watched as it attempts to raise capital to fuel its growth in mobile where it derives nearly three-quarters of its revenue . The IPO also comes at a time of uncertainty , with the company having posted a loss of $ 134 million for the first nine months of 2013 , almost double the amount for the same period in 2012 . Likewise , many question the company 's treacherous journey to convert global users , which account for three-quarters of its user base into a meaningful revenue stream . They only account for 25 % of the company 's overall revenue of $ 422 million for the first nine months of the year . All in all , Twitter 's first day on the Exchange means more for a small group made up of founders , execs and early stock holders than it does to most of the millions who use the site , but look for the push and pull of Wall Street to trickle down to the rest of us before long . Areas users will notice changes are in advertisements , ways to monetize users , deeper TV integration , a better `` onboarding experience , '' and a more vigorous drive into mobile . Especially with its losses , investors are going to ask , `` What are you doing , Twitter , to get the most money of @ techradar and everyone else ? '' We do n't expect J.P. Morgan to namecheck us , but the company knows its success now more than ever depends on getting users , keeping them engaged and finding ways to make money from them . And this definitely means changes for all of us .

Wave goodbye to the Like thumbs up . Facebook has announced a redesign for the Like button is on the way , one that chops the digit in favor of a simpler look . The Share button is also seeing a tinker , and both new buttons will start rolling out to everyone on Facebook in the coming weeks . The social network said it 's already seen an increase in Likes and Shares with the redesign , so we 'll give it one final thumbs up , for old times sake . Like this blip ? Well , head over this way for more .
Following months of revelations that the government has likely collected information from and about you ( yes , you ) , Apple has issued its first formal transparency report . Google , Yahoo , Facebook and others have circulated these for some time now , but Apple , perhaps struck by a pang of duty , is out with its own data on government information requests for both accounts and devices . The data covers the period between January 1 , 2013 and June 30 , 2013 . Apple pointedly noted that `` [ u ] nlike many other companies dealing with requests for customer data from government agencies , Apple 's main business is not about collecting information , '' a clear jibe at the likes of Google . Earlier part in the report , the company stated : `` [ O ] ur business does not depend on collecting personal data . We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers . We protect personal conversations by providing end-to-end encryption over iMessage and FaceTime . We do not store location data , Maps searches , or Siri requests in any identifiable form . '' Because of this , Apple said the `` vast majority '' of requests it receives are for information about lost or stolen devices . Apple logs these as device requests . `` Only a small fraction of the requests '' governments send Apple 's way are for personal information related to an iTunes , iCloud or Game Center accounts . These requests typically involve the account holder 's personal data and `` their use of an online service in which they have an expectation of privacy . '' Apple categorizes orders for identifying information , email , stored photographs and other user content stored online as account requests . Account requests most commonly involve robberies and other crime or requests involving law enforcement searching for a missing person or child , finding a kidnap victim or hoping to prevent a suicide , Apple explained . These requests typically see Apple turning over information in someone 's iTunes or iCloud account , like a name or address . `` In very rare cases , we are asked to provide stored photos or email . We consider these requests very carefully and only provide account content in extremely limited circumstances , '' Apple assured . The company noted that in order to get user info , government agencies need a court order . The Apple legal team pours over these , and only after determining them `` valid and appropriate '' does it hand over `` the narrowest possible set of information responsive to the request . '' While the account request orders for most regions are down to the number , there 's one glaring exception . The United States has imposed a set of stipulations that limit the amount and type of information Apple can reveal . The company , for example , is required to combine national security orders with account-based law enforcement requests , and only a range in increments of 1,000 are allowed to enumerate the orders . For account requests , the US leads the pack in all categories , though again , no specifics are allowed . All we know is that total requests numbered between 1,000 - 2,000 , and in an unspecified number of cases , some data was disclosed . Australia sent 74 requests , and data was disclosed for 41 of those . Thirty-four requests ended with no data disclosed . The UK issued 127 requests , and in one instance some unspecified content was disclosed . Apple did n't give out any information for 80 of those requests . Apple also recorded the number of times it objected to a request and when the end result was no information handed over . The company noted that in some cases where data was n't disclosed , it may have objected to the request or found no relevant information after a search . As Apple stated , device information requests far exceed account requests in most regions . Apple received 1,178 device requests from Australia , and for 59 % of those Apple provided some data . The UK issued 1,028 requests and received some info for 67 % of them .

Samsung 's Galaxy Gear just got a little smarter , as it can now display partial messages from Twitter , Facebook and Gmail . An update that enables the new features is hitting now , slowly rolling out to the Samsung smart watch . Galaxy Gear users will now be able to see tweet activity , Gmail emails , and Facebook notifications they receive on the smart watch 's 1.63-inch display . The rub is that these messages will only be displayed in part , but Gear users will at least get a preview before deciding whether to whip out their smartphones . The Galaxy Gear was unveiled and launched in 2013 to a lukewarm reception . The Samsung smart watch seems to have potential - or at least the ideas behind it do . But ultimately it does n't do very much , it supports a limited number of smartphones , and it 's bulky besides . This update helps a bit , but Smart Watch hopefuls are still waiting for the futuristic device of their dreams . The current Galaxy Gear update also tweaks Smart Relay , making it easier to jump between the smart watch and your phone , and an improved lift-and-pause gesture to activate the clock . However Pocket-lint reported that there are some kinks to work out , including a bug that somehow combines Gmail messages when you get three at the same time . In related news , Phone Scoop reported that Verizon 's Galaxy Note 2 has been updated with Galaxy Gear support . Happy holidays , everyone !
Video on-demand service Hulu will face a lawsuit brought by users who allege the company illegally shared their viewing habits with Facebook and market research company comScore . In a hearing on Monday , the catch-up giant failed to have the privacy case dismissed now faces the prospect of paying out substantial damages if a San Francisco court rules in favour of users . It is claimed that Hulu allowed marketers , advertisers and social networking companies to track the personal viewing habits of users and even provided the identifying Facebook ID the user registered with . All this was done without the users ' permission , according to the claimants representing Hulu users across the nation who are demanding compensation of $ 2,500 per user , per violation , plus other damages . The privacy case is being debated under the 1988 , Video Privacy Protection Act ( VPPA ) , which was passed in order to protect the anonymity of video renters , following a 1987 newspaper article that exposed the rental history of a Supreme Court nominee . Hulu argues that the privacy infractions are unfounded because the sharing of the information had not caused any personal injury to users . The judge , U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler , rejected the claim . A Hulu representative told the court that the VPPA `` was not adopted to impose multi-billion dollar liability on the transmission of anonymous data where no one suffers any actual injury , '' but the claim fell on deaf ears . Hulu will , once again , attempt to have the case dismissed at a hearing in February . Via Reuters

T-Mobile is introducing some bonus social networking action for customers on its pre-paid GoSmart tariffs , with the network announcing plans to offer free Facebook access in the new year . From January , even those customers without data plans will benefit from unmetered access to the Facebook app and Facebook Messenger when on the go . Those customers who do have a data plan , as part of the pay-as-you-go deal , will not be charged for accessing Facebook over mobile data . It 's the first time a US network has partnered with Facebook in order to offer free access to the social network , although the company has teamed up with others around the world . `` Facebook 's mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected , and we 're delighted that GoSmart subscribers , many who do n't have data access , will be able to use Facebook for free , '' said Chris Daniels , vice president of partnerships at Facebook . Doug Chartier , senior vice president of T-Mobile GoSmart , added : `` Customers love GoSmart because it 's one of the simplest and most budget-friendly no annual contract options in wireless . The deal just got a whole lot sweeter . '' Via The Verge

Google+ is n't the most populated social network out there , but its Year in Review is now more sophisticated than the popular Facebook feature of the same name . That 's because the search engine giant is using its Auto Awesome technology to piece together both memorable photos and video you have backed up through Google+ . `` This time of year we reconnect with loved ones , and we reflect on the moments that really matter , '' wrote Anil Sabharwal , lead product manager at Google Photos , in a Google+ post . `` Many people have been saving and sharing their photos and videos on Google+ all year long . And for those select users we 've got one more holiday gift : an # AutoAwesome year in review . '' Sabharwal made a point in saying that Year in Review sources its AutoAwesome photos and videos from Google+ Auto Backups feature , but it 's never public unless you share it . `` In all cases these gifted items appear in your account automatically , '' he noted . `` As long as you 're backing things up to Google+ , you 'll get notified whenever an awesome ( and private ) version is ready to share . '' Active Google+ users who have Auto Backup turned on will be notified in the `` next week or so '' as to whether they 'll be able to watch movie memories curated by Google 's algorithms .

Facebook is preparing itself for a public legal battle with its investors . A US court has ruled that those who lost money on the social network 's flotation could pursue claims against them . A group of shareholders were left out of pocket by the initial public offering in May 2012 . They 've been arguing since that Facebook and its bankers had left material information out of the `` S-1 '' document it filed ahead of its market debut . They claim that Facebook should have published more information about the impact growing mobile usage was likely to have on revenues at the company . Facebook and the banks involved in the row claim that the information was immaterial , and that it was under no obligation to make such disclosures . Manhattan judge Robert Sweet , however , has sided with the investors . This has opened the path for them to lodge a wave of claims against Facebook and dozens of banks . Sweet added that a surge in the number of users accessing Facebook on their mobiles had already had a `` material negative '' impact on revenues by the time of its IPO . The Californian business , he argued , should have made this much clearer to investors . Facebook 's IPO went public at $ 38 ( £23 , AU $ 42 ) a share , and rose as high as $ 45 ( £27 , AU $ 50 ) on its first day of trading . It finished its first day at $ 38.25 ( £23.37 , AU $ 42 ) however , and began a steady descent from there . It reached as low as $ 17.55 ( £10 , AU $ 19 ) in September . Analysts said it was officially the worst IPO in a decade . Since , the company has gained ground again after working out how to monetise mobile users more efficiently . Shares were trading at $ 54.56 ( £33 , AU $ 61 ) at lunchtime in New York on Wednesday .
SportStream , a San Francisco-based startup whose app lets users analyse social media mentions of sport , has been acquired by Facebook . The move is widely speculated to have been an attempt by Facebook to become more like social media rival Twitter , which allows users to view what others are saying on the same subject . SportStream , founded 18 months ago , enables broadcasters and content editors to aggregate , filter and display sports data in real-time . Sporting events are among the highest trending topics on Twitter , and Facebook is more than likely looking to identify what users are talking about to enable them to challenge the dominance of the real-time social site . SportStream has welcomed the deal , the value of which was not disclosed , and believes the move can help it reach more people . In a statement , Facebook said : `` Facebook sees the value in our technologies and team , and we 're excited to be a part of their continued investment in their platform . With this next step for SportStream , we 'll have greater resources to continue to do what we do best and make an impact on the more than one billion people who use Facebook . '' Facebook has taken steps to make it easier for users to use specific topics . These include the introduction of hashtags , embedded posts and trending topics . October saw Facebook purchase mobile data compression startup Onavo in a bid to make its service more cross-platform , especially on mobile devices .

It would be all too easy to mock the tourist who walked off a pier because she was too busy checking her phone to realise she 'd reached the end of the walkway . But have n't we all nearly been there now ? If it is n't a pier , it 's a busy road or a tree or a lamppost or an angry commuter or a confused dog or a bin or a glass door . Honestly , real life does n't half get in the way of technology sometimes . Good on the lady in question for managing to keep her phone in hand while foundering in the cold Melbourne waters in the dark without knowing how to swim . Now if she 'd had Google Glass ... You 'd be forgiven for walking off a pier while checking blips - they 're very diverting .

Facebook has confirmed that it is testing video ads that start playing automatically as they infiltrate your news feed . The new ads are hitting both the web and mobile news feeds - Facebook says the videos will be `` downloadd in advance when the device was connected to Wi-Fi '' so it should n't eat into your data plan ( but will eat into your device 's memory instead ) . Autoplaying videos are already shown in the iOS Facebook app but they 'll now proliferate to other platforms too . The good news is that the ads will be muted when they start playing unless you specifically click on them or opt to view them in full screen . Only a small group of Facebookers will see the trailers to begin with , and if they watch through to the end of the video they 'll be shown a carousel of two more videos they might want to watch . This development comes after a year of rumours and recent reports that the video ads had been delayed until 2014 . No such luck .

It 's the season of giving , and in that vein Facebook has announced it 's launching a way for users to donate to select nonprofits , all the while collecting more of your info . The feature is called Donate , and through a new `` Donate Now '' button the social network 's one-billion-plus members can give to groups such as UNICEF , Girls Inc. , Oxfam America and the World Wildlife Fund . Donate will pop up next to News Feed posts and at the top of groups ' Facebook pages . Clicking Donate Now lets users enter a donation amount , input their payment info and send the monetary gift then and there . They can also share the nonprofits ' posts with their friends , expanding the umbrella of do-gooding-ness ever further . There are 19 participating nonprofts for now , but Facebook said it plans to expand the program soon . It 's a seemingly altruistic addition by Facebook , one that should earn deserving organizations plenty of much needed dinero . However , there 's a silver lining in it for Facebook in that Donate also nets users ' billing information . Perhaps more motivated by the spirit of giving than of buying , users may find themselves more willing to type in their payment information , turning it over to the social network for digitized keeping . Later , the same info could be easy-filled when making purchases on Facebook from for-profit companies . Mark Zuckerber 's firm has also recently started offering a feature called Autofill With Facebook , a button that third-party mobile apps can utilize at the point of checkout to populate billing and shipping information with minimal typing . Facebook does n't earn a fee from Autofill , however it can tap its data to show businesses how effective their ads are . With credit card info perhaps more readily inputted thanks to Donate , getting more folks to punch the Autofill could be part of Facebook 's designs . As TechCrunch pointed out , users can delete their credit card information after making a donation through their payment account settings , but it 's an extra step in the process and one that 's not readily obvious . We do n't want to sound overly cynical as really , who can argue with donating to help save endangered animals , but just know Facebook should see ample benefits too .
Social media giant Facebook appears to have taken measures towards running its production workloads on ARM-powered servers . The move spells double trouble for market leader Intel , as Google has also announced similar intentions . A post on the Hip Hop Virtual Machine ( HHVM ) blog on Thursday indicated that the team there is implementing ARM processor support into its translation engine . It is this engine that turns Facebook 's PHP code into 64-bit x86 instructions . The HHVM is also Facebook 's crucial unit used for running its gargantuan social network – which is mainly based on PHP . `` It 's been crucial to get HHVM running on ARM processors , isolating and reducing the amount of architecture-specific code we need to reimplement , '' the post read . It came on the same day that Bloomberg claimed Google was planning a similar shift to ARM-driven servers . A post has also appeared on the Facebook careers website for an ARM server software engineer . `` We aim to evaluate further improving the efficiency of our web tier by porting HHVM to new server hardware platforms based on the power-efficient ARM , '' the listing states . Facebook was asked back in 2012 if it was planning a broad shift to non-x86 chips , and answered that it was not ' a question of if , but when ' . This shift to ARM architecture may still take some time to implement . At the Linaro Connect Conference in October , Facebook technology strategist Vijay Rao said : `` We definitely feel it 's going to take at least two to three years before the ARM ecosystem as well as ARM mature to a point where we can actually deploy it . '' The work Facebook is doing at the moment appears to be based around making ARM a possible choice , rather than total preparation for a large-scale switch .

Facebook has pushed out a new update for its iOS app , adding a feature that sees videos automatically play as you scroll past them . Like it or loathe it , the version 6.8 update introduces the mandatory auto-play function , which follows in the footsteps of Vine and Instagram . Like Instagram , the sound will be muted unless you actually click on it , but if you want you can alter the settings so that video and audio start playing together in harmony . While it wo n't be embraced lovingly by everyone , the good news is that you can set auto-play to Wi-Fi-only if you 're watching the old data allowance . Facebook also told TechCrunch that it plans to roll out the feature to the web version of Facebook . This means that everything is in place for Facebook to start rolling out those 15-second autoplaying ads that are rumoured to start appearing soon . Right now this is just on the iOS app , but we 've asked Facebook when the same feature might roll over to other platforms and will update when we hear more .

Facebook is expanding its interest in artificial intelligence by creating a new AI laboratory and selecting New York University professor Yann LeCun to head it up . `` Facebook has created a new research laboratory with the ambitious , long-term goal of bringing about major advances in Artificial Intelligence , '' LeCun announced on his Facebook page today . The social networking company is also entering into a partnership with New York University 's Center for Data Science to carry out research in data science , machine learning , and AI . The brainy group will have locations in Menlo Park , London , and at Facebook 's new facility in New York City , right up the street from where LeCunn will still teach part time . LeCun 's hire could act as a long-term method of improving Facebook 's already sophisticated social graph , which determines the stories pop up on your News Feed . It could also act as a way to counter Google and its own artificial intelligence endeavor with futurist Ray Kurzweil that was announced earlier this year . Both companies are competing to have computers better understand human language by hiring top minds from the outside . Yahoo , similarly , is scooping up whole companies dealing with natural language . Since LeCun did n't have a whole lot of details to share in his post , TechRadar contacted him and Facebook for more about how such AI research will benefit the end user . We will update this story if we hear back . In the meantime , LeCun did mention that Facebook is hiring the most intelligent among us for its newly formed artificial intelligence lab .
It 's nearing the end of a year once again and that means it 's time to recount all the hot trends , songs , movies and memes we embraced over the past 12 months . Luckily for Facebook 's 1.19 billion users , the social network has gone and collated the Year in Review just for you . According to Facebook , Pope Francis took the top spot as the most talked about person , followed closely by the Royal Baby . Elections around the world were the most talked about happenings , according to the social network . The year was also filled with many somber moments including the Boston Marathon bombings as well as the deaths of Margaret Thatcher and Nelson Mandela . Facebook arrived at its conclusions by measuring the number of posts mentioning a particular person or event , including related hashtags . Shifting over to the US , which Facebook devoted an entire section in its review to , the most chatted about topics were the Super Bowl ( talk about perpetuating stereotypes ) followed by the government shutdown and the Boston Marathon . Mercifully , Daft Punk 's Get Luckyoff of the electronic duo 's latest album took the top slot for music despite Miley Cyrus ' twerking routine . Of course the meme that everyone loves ( to forget about ) was the Harlem Shake . Top pick for movie of the year was The Conjuring and the most talked about TV show was Scandal . Oddly enough , one topic that did n't make the grade Edward Snowden and the revelations that have erupted over the NSA 's mass surveillance program . Other nations were n't left out of Facebook 's review of course , and a regional-specific look is available for places including the UK and Australia . The UK 's No . 1 topic was Andy Murray , followed by Ms. Thatcher . In Australia , `` vote '' was the most popular topic , cricket the third and Big Brother rounded out the top 10 . Facebook is also allowing users to see their own highlights via Facebook.com/yearinreview . Through some algorithmic magic , the social network will arrange the most important things you 've done this year into a gallery , letting users wax nostalgic over another year gone by .
On the face of it , Facebook 's proposed sympathy button is a terrible idea that takes us one step closer to living in an idiocracy . Never mind keyboards : in the future all we 'll need is two buttons , one with a smiley face and one with a sad face . Jane had a baby ! Happyface ! Nelson Mandela died ! Sadface ! But a sympathy button is n't necessarily a bad idea . Over at brainy chat forum Metafilter , sad news is often accompanied by a sea of full stops , commenters posting `` . '' as shorthand for `` I ca n't think of any way to express my sadness that would n't repeat what others have said or that would n't sound trite '' . It can be a surprisingly moving thing , a kind of online equivalent of a minute 's silence as the scrolling screen remains wordless . Handled properly , a sympathy button might offer something similar . It 's the `` handled properly '' bit I find hard to imagine . `` Responding to a heartfelt tale of sadness with a single click rather than kind words does rather say , ' I care , but not very much ' . '' The Like button is a rather blunt instrument , and it can be misinterpreted : when someone Likes your post about bad news , are they saying they 're happy that you 're having a crappy time ? And of course , it 's often used as a substitute for proper conversation , people clicking Like when they would once have sent you a card or called you on the phone . That is n't always a problem . If you 've posted something funny , or linked to something good , a Like tells you that I found it funny or good too . There 's no need to explain it or expand on it . But responding to a heartfelt tale of sadness with a single click rather than kind words does rather say , `` I care , but not very much . '' There 's another side to it too . We 've all got glass-half-empty types in our networks , and until now we 've been able to ignore their poor-me posts because it 's inappropriate to click Like . A sympathy button ruins that , enabling them to quantify exactly how much attention they 're getting . Maybe it 'll even encourage them to post more of the same , turning your News Feed into a Blues Feed . It 's a people problem rather than a technology problem , of course : the best people in your network wo n't merely click Sympathise when you 're sharing devastating news any more than they think Like is an acceptable alternative to a congratulatory message . But by encouraging us to connect with and to stay connected to everybody we 've ever met in our entire lives , Facebook has ensured that our networks consist largely of people who care , but who do n't care very much .

Remember , before Facebook , when friends used to ring you up to wish you a happy birthday ? Or to congratulate you on a new job rather than writing on the wall or clicking the 'Like ' button ? Well now the traditional expressions of sympathy during sad times , an arm around the shoulder , an invite for a pint , a card in the post or a bunch of flowers are potentially under threat from the social network . Facebook has revealed it is actively experimenting with a 'Sympathise ' button , which was dreamt up at a recent hackathon event and was an immediate hit . It would work , as thus : If you tag your status with a negative emotion , such as 'feeling sad ' then a 'Sympathise ' button would replace the 'Like ' button . `` It would be , 'five people sympathise with this , ' instead of 'five people 'like ' this , ' '' said Dan Muriello , a Facebook engineer . `` Of course a lot of people were - and still are - very excited about . But we made a decision that it was not exactly the right time to launch that product . Yet . '' In some cases , this would be a nice idea . After all , when someone expresses a loss , users may appreciate the sentiment 's expressed in a status update , but clicking 'Like ' does n't quite seem appropriate . Also when one of your mates complains about their boss , or the late running trains , or their relegation-threatened football team , Like also does n't seem to cover it . However , Facebook already does so much to take the effort out of maintaining a real , friendship and the sincerity of real-life well wishes , do we really need that threatened further by a sympathy button ? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below . Via Huffington Post

If you 've tried to log in to Facebook in the past couple of days and been told you have to reset your password , it 's probably because your login details were compromised by data thieves . A trove of 1,580,000 website login details and 320,000 email accounts have been posted online , with Facebook , Yahoo , Google and Twitter the top targeted sites . Facebook had the most accounts compromised , with 57 % of the stolen passwords linked to the social network , which has since put any affected users through the forced reset process . Although even the team that found the password pile , Trustwave , is n't completely sure how the data was stolen , it suspects that key-logging malware is to blame . As ever , the best idea is to reset your passwords and use different ones for each site you log in to online . And steer clear of these ten rubbish passwords , which Trustwave says are the ten most frequently used in this latest batch of stolen data : Come on guys , would a little imagination kill you ?

Facebook has lost its mobile messaging lead to the upstart WhatsApp platform , according to new research published this weekend . OnDevice surveyed almost 4,000 smartphone users in five countries and found that a whopping 44 per cent of them were using WhatsApp to stay in touch with friends . 35 per cent of those folks - in US , Brazil , South Africa , Indonesia and China - were using Facebook Messenger in November . Despite eliminating BlackBerry users , the reborn BBM platform was down in 5th place with a respectable 15 per cent of those surveyed using the service , behind WeChat ( 28 per cent ) and Twitter ( 16 per cent ) . BlackBerry 's platform does seem to be doing exceedingly well in South Africa , according to the study , will 34 per cent of surveyed users frequenting the app in November . Another takeaway from the research was the popularity of social messaging apps compared with traditional SMS messaging . OnDevice found the 85 per cent of its sample used the likes of WhatsApp and Facebook last month , while 75 per cent used text messages . As is often the case with these surveys , it 's by no means conclusive . There was no mention of the $ 3 billion-valued Snapchat , while the influential European mobile market was ignored entirely .

Facebook Paper is the social network 's latest mobile app , taking your news feed and recrafting it into an elegant book-like experience . As anticipated , it takes strands of Flipboard 's web-reading experience letting you flick through posted links quickly and comfortably , while also reworking your friends ' photos into a more album-like style and using a very un-Facebook like horizontal scrolling style . Gone is the standard app 's traditional slide-out menu pane , instead you customise a grid from your news feed elements , then smoothly swipe through it . The publishing options are also pretty swish - photos and text appear together so you know what you 're uploading rather than the current system which leaves you a little bit blind . There are elements of the original Facebook app that are n't present in Paper , but Facebook is n't wary about having too many apps on your phone - if anything , it wants to create more and more . The bad news is that this is a pretty limited release : Facebook Paper will only be available in the US and only on the iPhone from February 3 . Is Facebook 's decline coming ?
Facebook reached another mobile milestone today , declaring it has made more money from ads on its phone and tablet apps than its desktop site , and that 's spurring new mobile features . In particular , the social network 's comprehensive Graph Search will make its way to mobile devices soon , announced CEO Mark Zuckerberg during Facebook 's fourth quarter earnings call . `` We 're really early in the game on this , '' he said referring to the desktop-only graph search . `` You can see that because we have n't even really rolled out our mobile version of graph search yet and we 're a mobile company . `` Pretty soon , you should expect us to roll out the mobile version of this . I think that 's going to be an important step because most of the usage of Facebook overall is on mobile . '' Facebook users can expect further tweaks to the company 's iOS and Android apps when graph search reaches mobile devices . However , the changes are likely limited to English-speaking countries , as Graph Search has only recently exited beta in the US and begun to roll out in the UK . `` It 's only in English so far , and we have to internationalize it , '' noted Zuckerberg . `` There 's a long roadmap of things we need to do . But it 's going to be incredibly useful when it 's ready . '' He sees Graph Search 's wider roll out as a three to five year investment rather than a more typical one or two year project . At issue are the trillions of pieces of content that people have shared on Facebook . Ranking it all is going to be a multi-year effort . `` As a number of people on the team who have worked on web search engines in the past have told me , a trillion pieces of content is more than the index in any web search engine , '' he boasted . Facebook did n't have any more information on its loss among teens as daily active users , saying `` it does n't have any new data to report today . '' However , Zuckerberg did hint that the company is interested in continuing to build apps outside of the Facebook platform like it has with Instagram and most recently Messenger . `` One of the things that we want to try to do over the next few years is build a handful of great new experiences that are separate from Facebook today that [ give ] people new ways to share . '' `` You can see it from our own offering , not just from Facebook but also Instagram and Messenger already today . We 're going to keep on working on this over the next few years . '' That means the rumored Flipboard-esque Paper app may join Facebook 's standalone app list that currently consists of Instagram , Messenger , Pages and it 's ill-fated Snapchat clone , Poke .

Facebook has developed a prototype Blu-ray storage system capable of holding 1 petabyte of data , a move that could revitalise the Blu-ray industry . The social media giant is about to step on toes in the storage market by delivering on a promise it made at last year 's Open Compute Summit to use Blu-ray discs as a replacement for current cold storage systems . The prototype , revealed by Facebook 's VP of Engineering Jay Parikh at this year 's summit , achieves the petabyte figure by using 10,000 Blu-ray discs in one cabinet , according to GigaOM . There are also plans to boost this up to a not too shabby 5 petabytes per cabinet . Parikh said the new system would cut storage costs by 50 per cent and reduce energy consumption by 80 per cent , which should please the capitalists and environmentalists alike . They will also last for 50 years , easily trumping the survivability of existing hard drive storage . The novel approach to cold storage could give Blu-ray a much-needed boost in the face of a shift away from disc storage to online streaming . With Netflix set to slowly ramp up its 4k efforts , and the Blu-ray Disc Association hoping to get a decent slice of the ultra high-definition market , a basic storage system could increase Blu-ray sales significantly . Just in case you think Facebook is only experimenting at this stage , consider that it already has its first Blu-ray cold storage site in production , hosting 30 petabytes of data . It also plans to launch another in the near future , and expects to reach 150 petabytes within months . If Facebook ever does lose most of its members , as Princeton University predicts , it could always consider becoming a data storage company . There 's nothing wrong with having a backup plan .

Facebook 's latest Android update requires you to give it the fairly invasive permission to read your text messages . It was spotted and brought to the internet 's attention by a Reddit user , who assumed that the inclusion of access to your phone 's SMS and MMS messages was to allow Facebook to skim off more information about you for yet more targeted advertising . But Facebook tells us it 's actually for a much less alarming reason . When we spoke to the social network , a spokesperson pointed us in the direction of Facebook Android engineer Franci Penov 's response to the post . He explained that the READ_SMS permission is used to `` automatically intercept login approvals SMS messages for people that have turned 2-factor authentication for their accounts , or for phone confirmation when you add a phone number to your Facebook account . '' If they could , Facebook 's engineers would make the permission more specific , so that the app can read only the messages sent from a specific number ( although Penov also notes that this would cause a lot of problems given that the numbers used vary from country to country ) . The other thing on the engineers ' wishlist is to tailor the required permissions based on your own preferences - so if you did n't opt for 2-factor authentication on your Facebook account , the app would n't request permission to read your messages . So while the social network steered clear of explicitly telling us it 's not skimming your messages for marketing reasons , a relatively innocent explanation for the rather alarming sounding request does exist .
British spies did n't stop short of allegedly infiltrating apps like Angry Birds to monitor web users , going as far as gathering YouTube , Facebook and Twitter data . This was accomplished by tapping into fiber optic cables used by the internet at large , according to an NBC News report featuring the latest leak via Edward Snowden . The GCHQ presentation , dubbed `` Psychology A New Kind of SIGDEV '' ( Signals Development ) , ended up in Snowden 's hands because British spies were showing the tactics to their American counterparts . The slides are said to be part of the UK government 's `` Squeaky Dolphin '' spying program and detailed how to track unencrypted YouTube views , Facebook likes , Twitter trends and even Blogger posts . With access to such data , British spies are said to have been able to analyze YouTube in real time to figure out which videos were going viral before protests broke out in volatile countries . This reportedly worked well in Bahrain . Two past Bahrain protest videos went viral again on February 13 , 2012 , leading to a heads-up of anti-government protests that took place the next day . A year earlier , without a spy program on the scale of Squeaky Dolphin in place , UK intelligence agencies - like all Western intelligence - missed the Arab Spring uprising of 2011 . Both Google and Facebook took issue with the intrusive collection of their users ' data , while a a GCHQ spokesperson told NBC News that it was working within the law when doing so . Facebook and Twitter have since encrypted their data , which would prevent governments from simply tapping into and collecting data via fiber optic cables . Google , however , has n't encrypted YouTube and Blogger data , although it has rolled out encryption for several of its data-sensitive products over the last several months . With Snowden reports putting the `` tell '' in `` intel '' with leaks of programs like Prism and Squeaky Dolphin , intelligence officials are claiming that lives are being put at risk . Privacy advocates are saying something slightly different : the internet 's credibility is what 's in danger .

It 's becoming rarer and rarer that we Like something Facebook does but it recently responded to a Princeton study that the social network will lose 80 % of its users by 2017 , by using the exact same data to come up with a number of interesting findings . By using the same Google Trends search score , which were published by TechCrunch , that bravely said Facebook would have a dangerous decline they found by 2021 Princeton would have no students at all . Oh , and this pesky air we all keep breathing , well that will run out by the year 2060 . If you like articles of dubious origin , then these blips are for you :

What does the Facebook of 2017 look like ? Judging by newly published research from Princeton University , it 's going to look rather like those haunting pictures of abandoned bits of Detroit . Facebook 's decline is coming , researchers say , and it 's coming so quickly that in three years ' time it 'll have lost 80 % of its peak audience . The researchers have n't just studied how annoying Facebook has become and thrown darts at a calendar to predict the future . They 've used science , and in particular the infectious recovery SIR model of studying diseases . Facebook is an epidemic , it seems , and like most epidemics it 'll only last so long . Facebook says the study is `` nonsense '' , and it probably is : it 's an interesting academic exercise rather than a rock-solid indicator of Facebook 's future . But it 's likely that the researchers ' predictions will still come true eventually . Facebook 's an empire , and all empires crumble . Facebook tries very hard to be the service you use for everything : not just chatting , but photo sharing , video watching , purchase researching , game playing… you get the idea . Whenever it spots us doing something it does n't offer , it either buys the service providing it or simply copies it . This month 's arrival of Twitter-aping trending topics in your news feed is just the latest example of that . The problem , of course , is that the likelihood that one organisation can be best-of-breed across a whole bunch of disparate areas forever is very remote . The internet is littered with the broken promises of portals that tried to do it and failed , from CompuServe and AOL to MSN and Yahoo ! Many of the sites remain big , but they 're not the all-conquering behemoths they once appeared to be . Facebook is likely to go the same way . It wo n't be quick - 80 % decline in three years is awfully far-fetched - or fatal , but we 're already seeing evidence of younger users leaving the service because they do n't want to hang out with their parents . That 's important because Facebook , like Soylent Green , is made of people - so the same network effects that made it essential ( and , back in the day , made AOL , CompuServe , Microsoft Word , MSN Messenger , Friends Reunited and MySpace essential ) also work in reverse . If the people you want to connect with start using something else , chances are that you 'll use that something else too . There 's a big difference between Facebook and previous Big Things , of course : this time around there 's no obvious giant slayer poised to do to Facebook what Facebook did to predecessors such as MySpace . But that 's because something even bigger is happening : we 're changing the way we use the internet , moving from the monolithic model of one-size-fits-all websites to a more atomised model of one-thing-done-really-well mobile apps . This is a shift just as big as the move from the walled gardens of AOL and CompuServe to the open internet of Web 2.0 . Facebook will certainly try to dominate that model too , but the odds are stacked massively against it .

It seems like Facebook is trying to be a good Samaritan ... to advertisers . The social media giant has announced it will begin testing a mobile ad network with a sampling of advertisers and app developers . Similar experiments have been done in the past without any solid results , but this time Facebook will have a guiding hand in the matter by `` working directly with a small number of advertisers and publishers , rather than an outside ad-serving platform . '' The app companies in question have not been mentioned . While the thought of `` more ads '' is enough to punch your computer screen or throw your phone at the wall , it seems like none of this will directly affect your Facebook News Feed . For now , it looks like the advertisers and the third party apps will simply be benefitting from Facebook 's `` rich targeting , '' with the social media site reaping the revenue . But it may only be a matter of time until all the outside testing begins to trickle into Facebook 's own mobile app to rake in more dough . The company has already been quite ambitious with its marketing endeavors like calling a truce with Google to sell ad space , and implementing sponsored Instagram photos . And do n't forget the video ads . Do n't say we did n't warn you .

Facebook has added a Trending topics feature to the News Feed to help users spot interesting and relevant conversations flaring up across the social network . The Trending section will be located on the upper right of the News Feed showing a list of topics personalized by the users ' interests . Each topic - ranging from TV shows , events and people - shows up as a headline with a brief explanation on why it 's trending . Clicking through any of these items brings up a more focused feed on specific topics complete with friend posts and news items from the users ' liked pages . For example , a Golden Globe awards Trending page would bring up stories from ABC and a dozen friend posts regaling what a stud Matthew McConaughey is … or what have you . The social network is rolling Trending out to the US , UK , India and Australia first . Facebook also noted it 's continuing its test of the feature on mobile . In an age of `` information overload , '' Facebook is the latest social media company to offer users a way to cut through the noise . Just a week ago , Yahoo introduced the News Digest app at its CES 2014 keynote , which curates news from around the web into a `` comprehensive , complete and easy '' reading list . Clutter is a problem on Facebook and between all the pages and groups , the regular Facebook News Feed looks like a schizophrenic mess . There 's no doubt the social network introduced Trending so users could easily find specific topics and jump to relevant events . Prior to the update , searching for a specific topic on Facebook only brought up events and groups . Trending on Facebook is a long overdue update that Twitter has already had for awhile now . The comparisons to Twitter 's trending section are ripe for the picking , though as the LA Times pointed out , Facebook 's feature does have a few unique elements , namely personally relevant topics and more robust information thanks to summaries .
In a matter of weeks we 'll be descending on Barcelona for MWC 2014 and , as it turns out , so will Mark Zuckerberg . The Facebook founder has just been announced as the headline keynote speaker for the first day of the event next month . Zuck will be kicking off the week with a `` fireside chat '' with David Kirkpatrick , in which he 'll `` explore the importance of extending the benefits ubiquituous Internet access to the unconnected world . '' Whether an actual fire will be present is yet to be confirmed . Last year , Facebook announced plans to bring affordable internet to the two-thirds of the world who do n't have it , so it sounds like a fair amount of the conversation will be centred around that . Other members of the internet.org initiative include big mobile players Ericsson , Samsung , Nokia , Opera , Qualcomm and MediaTek . But more generally , Zuckerberg 's headline presence at the show just goes to show how big mobile is for Facebook right now . Maybe there 'll even be some better news for Facebook Home .

Imagine rolling over in bed each morning , awakening your phone and turning to a Facebook product to get caught up on the day 's happenings . Sounds like something most of us do anyway , right ? In the very near future - as soon as the end of the month , actually - Facebook 's long-rumored news reader may finally become part of our information consumption routine . According to sources speaking with Re/code , Facebook 's news reading service is known as `` Paper . '' It takes cues from Flipboard , and will either be a standalone app for mobile or a web experience designed to fit smaller screens . Like Flipboard , Paper sounds to be an aggregator for content including news stories from the likes of the New York Times and Washington Post as well as status updates from other Facebookers . It will all be arranged in a eye-popping `` paper-like '' format , one hard-copy news readers cling to fondly . Paper 's launch timeline may change , according to one source , so there 's no guarantee we 'll be turning to Facebook for all our newsy needs ( beyond baby bump updates ) come February 1 . The first inklings of a Facebook reader first popped up in June 2013 , but apparently the project has been years in the making and started as many other FB products have - piece of a News Feed overhaul . We saw some of the new News Feed redesign come to life in March 2013 , but the other parts left unfinished have apparently found their way to Paper . If and when Paper makes its way off the virtual presses , users wo n't be the only ones to benefit from the rich reading experience ; engagement and user eyeballs so valuable to advertisers are certainly a driver for Facebook to finish the project .

More retailers are deploying a Pinterest 'Pin It ' button on their product pages than the equivalent Facebook 'Like ' button , according to new stats . Social analytics firm 8thBridge kept an eye on 872 shopping portals between July and November 2013 and found 62 per cent of sites slapped a 'Pin It ' button on their sites . While that narrowly edged out the 61 per cent of sites who added a 'Tweet ' option on their page , Facebook 'Like ' buttons only showed up on 59 per cent of the retail sites monitored . D Google '+1 ' buttons found a home on 42 per cent of sites , which , in all honesty , is n't a bad return for the much-maligned social network . Facebook 's fall from grace does n't end their , apparently . According to 8thBridge , Facebook members are n't interacting with their favourite brands with anywhere near as much regularity as they have in previous years . The firm says engagement is down 27 per cent compared with last year , when it comes to 'Likes ' and conversations taking place on brand posts and pages . However , it 's not all doom and gloom for Zuckerberg 's crew as 99 per cent of brands surveyed still have a Facebook page , but is that page becoming less and less important ? Is Pinterest really yielding greater results for businesses than Facebook ? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below .

Little Eye Labs , an Indian startup that builds mobile app analysis tools , has been bought by Facebook . Founded about a year ago by four Bangalore-based technology professionals Giridhar Murthy , Kumar Rangarajan , Satyam Kandula and Lakshman Kakkirala , Little Eye is backed by GSF and VenturEast Tenet Fund . Android developers and testers use Little Eye Labs to measure , analyse and optimise the performance of their apps . The company has said that the deal will allow it to leverage Facebook 's 'world-class infrastructure ' to help improve performance of the social network 's apps . `` For us , this is an opportunity to make an impact on the more than 1 billion people who use Facebook , '' said the Little Eye Labs team in a blog post . Facebook 's engineering manager Subbu Subramanian told Reuters : `` The Little Eye Labs technology will help us to continue improving our Android codebase to make more efficient , higher-performing apps . '' The terms of the deal have not been disclosed , but a report by TechCrunch estimates the price could have been as much as $ 15 million ( £9 million , AU $ 16 million ) . The entire team at Little Eye Labs will be moved to Facebook 's headquarters in Menio Park , California . The acquisition marks the social network giant 's first deal in India . The deal is thought to have been done to boost interest in India 's startup ecosystem , where high profile acquisitions are often rare . The deal represents `` a giant step from an Indian startup ecosystem perspective '' , said Praveen Bhadada , from Zinnov , a consultancy specialising in tech companies based in Bangalore . The company have also said that crrent customers of Little Eye for Android will receive further information on plans to odder a free version of Little Eye until June 2014 .

We have our own idea about how it all went down when Facebook offered to buy out Snapchat , but the exact reason why the photomessaging app rejected Zuckerberg 's $ 3 billion envelope was never made clear . According to Snapchat 's chief executive , he was looking at the bigger picture . `` There are very few people in the world who get to build a business like this , '' Evan Spiegel told Forbes . `` I think trading that for some short-term gain is n't very interesting . '' $ 3 billion ? A short-term gain ? Where do you eat lunch every day ? Bet he 'd never turn down a blip though

Facebook is being sued over claims that it has been scanning users ' private messages and passing on the information to advertisers . According to the allegations , based on independent research , Facebook scans messages that include links to other sites in order to discover what people are interested in . It then uses this information `` to improve its marketing algorithms and increase its ability to profit from data about Facebook users , '' so goes the lawsuit allegation . A spokesperson for Facebook told TechRadar : `` We continue to believe the allegations in this lawsuit have no merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously . '' The lawsuit was filed by Matthew Campbell and Michael Hurley with the Northern District Court of California , starting back in 2012 with claims that Facebook had been scanning through messages and recording links as `` likes '' . The case is ongoing and we may not see anything settled for some time . Right now the claimants are looking to get an injunction against Facebook in order to stop it scanning messages in the future , as well as money for alleged damages . Then again , not everyone agees that Facebook would be in the wrong to scan private messages . Security expert Graham Cluley wrote on his blog : `` if Facebook 's security team did n't have such systems in place I would believe them to be disturbingly lax in their duty of care for users . '' Security 's a bit of a hot topic this week , eh ?

A few days after shuttering its @ facebook email service , the social network has swung an axe at its Messenger app for Windows and Firefox . In-app notifications have started informing users that the Windows desktop service will shut down on March 3 . Firefox users are receiving the same end-of-support note . `` We 're sorry , but we can no longer support Facebook Messenger for Windows/Firefox , and it will stop working on March 3 , 2014 . We really appreciate you using Messenger to reach your friends , and we want to make sure you know that you can keep chatting and view all your messages on http : //www.facebook.com , '' the message reads . Meanwhile , the link to the Windows app has been taken down on Facebook , leaving only the Android and iOS versions . There 's no indication why Facebook has decided to phase out its chat client for desktop . However , users wo n't be left without a way of chatting as they will still be able to access their messages through Facebook 's website . It 's likely the company is making these moves to get more visitors on the full site , move them onto mobile and earn more ad eyeballs in the process . What 's more , it 's likely that the apps suffered the same fate as the @ facebook.com ; not enough people used them . Even as Facebook phases out apps on older messaging platforms , it 's diving head first into new ventures . The company recently made a $ 19 billion ( about £11b/AU/ $ 21b ) play to acquire WhatsApp . During MWC 2014 , Facebook confirmed that a standalone Messenger app will soon arrive for Windows Phone 8 devices .

Mark Zuckerberg has been rather busy of late , what with spending $ 19 billion on Whatsapp and trying to get the whole world online through the internet.org initiative . But this has n't stopped him from wielding the axe over Facebook email – something he claimed was the `` future of modern messaging '' when it was launched back in 2010 . Turns out it really , really was n't . Facebook told the Verge that the reason for the demise of the service is because it is `` most people have n't been using their Facebook email address . '' This does n't surprise us given that in 2012 Facebook forced its branded emails on to everyone that uses the social network . Forcing the general public to do anything usually ends up with tears and tantrums especially when something as precious as email addresses are at stake . Let 's just hope it does n't do the same thing with Whatsapp , or we will see another future of modern messaging given the axe . But it spent billions on that so it will never die , right ? Right ?
BlackBerry has confirmed its ever-popular BBM platform will spread its wings to a new platform later this year when it joins the Windows Phone fray . On day one of MWC 2014 , the company announced it will also support the new Nokia X Android/Windows Phone hybrid . BlackBerry said the Windows Phone expansion comes as a response to demand from users following the rollout on Android and iOS late last year . Currently , the company is hard at work on the new apps and said the Windows Phone version will arrive sometime this summer . The rollout comes just 24 hours after Microsoft announced Facebook Messenger would be arriving on Windows Phone in the near future . During that event Microsoft promised a host more high profile apps would arrive to plug the gaps . It seems like BBM and Facebook Messenger will be the first of many .

Microsoft is releasing an update to Windows Phone later this year , which should allow phone makers to create cheaper phones as it ups its fight against Android . Although Microsoft is being cagey about giving it an official name , we 're expecting the software to be known as Windows Phone 8.1 and it should be released at some point this spring . The company is lessening its vice-like control over Windows Phone hardware by allowing the use of lower-end Qualcomm processors , and letting manufacturers do away with physical buttons if they want to . Until now , Microsoft had demanded three standard keys on the front of the handset , plus a camera shutter button too . After the update , phones will also be able to store apps on the SD card for the first time , and manufacturers can make dual-SIM Windows Phones too . Microsoft is even letting phone makers reuse their Android designs for Windows Phone , which is a pretty big move for the control-freaks over in Redmond . There 'll also be some new faces in the Windows Phone game - Lenovo and Foxconn will be making devices , while LG is also returning to the WP fold . These updates add up to cheaper phones as Microsoft goes after emerging markets like India where many people are yet to buy their first smartphone . Finally , a treat for existing Windows Phone users : Facebook Messenger will be hitting the OS in a matter of weeks . The Windows Phone 8.1 update is 'technically ' compatible with existing Windows Phone 8 devices , but it sounds as though carriers will have the final say in whether you get it or not . Stay tuned .
We have n't seen so many billions of dollars in the news since the banking crisis . The revelation that Facebook paid $ 19bn to buy chat app WhatsApp was definitely Tech Shock of the Week , as Zuckerberg 's plan to build his own self-contained internet moved up a gear . There were two comments that appeared to be compulsory in every online response thread about the buy - people joking `` Ah , but I downloaded WhatsApp for free ! '' then pausing for the applause and upvotes that never came , plus commenters who instantly claimed they 'd be abandoning WhatsApp immediately because they 're so super-anti-corporate and edgy . It also brought out the financial analyst in everyone , as every bloke-with-a-phone did the maths and worked out how much Facebook paid to acquire each existing WhatsApp user , then offered a variety of reasons why it 's the stupidest business move since the last time anyone agreed to be bought out by Yahoo . One such maths-doer was CNBC commenter Marc Tinkleneberg , who calculated : `` ... it would probably cost less than 100m to reinvent it . 16bn to buy a 500m user base does not make sense either , as one can suspect that this user base already overlaps more than 80 % with FB 's existing user base . '' More interesting than the vague sums was his anecdote about what his teenage daughter is up to nowadays ( steady on ) , with Marc claiming : `` My 15-year-old daughter and her classmates already moved on , from WhatsApp to Viber . '' Hope you 're not reading her messages , Marc . Sounds like you might be sneaking glances at what she 's doing over her shoulder at least , which can only lead to misery . A little further down , reader Donna_Summer offered a cynical take on the purchase of a virtual asset being funded mainly by shares , saying : `` A website comprised of lines of computer code , which manufactures nothing , blows 16 billion dollars on another website comprised of more computer code , which also manufactures nothing . It 's like Farmville for the elites . '' For the opinion of the common man not overly familiar with complicated concepts like maths , we popped over to the Daily Mail . Reader Mutal was busy RAGING about the HIDDEN COST of using WhatsApp , moaning furiously : `` On principal , I will not use WhatsApp because they charge for their app in very fine small print when you download their app . The charges come at the end of a year use . And practically everyone I know who uses this app when asked if they know they will be charged for it , ALL have looked clueless or dumbfounded until I get them to check the terms and conditions FINE print . '' Dude , it 's only 59p/99c . 59p/99c a year . Exactly how hard did the recession hit you if that 's such an enormous deal breaker ? And who 's dumbfounded ? Give us their email addresses because we do n't believe you . The best story to come out of the acquisition was the fact that newly minted WhatsApp boss Brian Acton moaned on Twitter that be 'd been rejected by both Twitter and Facebook for something , presumably an early WhatsApp concept or just a job , way back in 2009 . The fact that Acton is a podgy gentleman in his 40s unlikely to fit in with the self-conscious Silicon Valley set was pulled out as one possible reason for his earlier rejection by some commenters , although being a `` normal '' man won him some respect over at the Guardian , where Losing_Haringey said : `` I 'd rather see relatively normal people get obscenely rich than the money-hungry corporate-minded drones that file over the Thames every morning . They 've made a program that millions of people use and get pleasure/convenience out of . They deserve the money . '' One of us got lucky . Now share the money around a bit , Brian . We did find one interesting comment that probed a bit deeper than feigned outrage and righteous claims of WhatsApp uninstallation . Over on TechCrunch , reader Daniel Roizman asked : `` Interesting to see software eating the world . How is it that the companies that build the phones , cell towers and fibre optic cables that are the infrastructure of the billion+ connected users are worth a fraction of the software layer on top of them ? Who 's investing in the hardware that will help WhatsApp reach the next billion ? '' Vad Dzhabaraov replied with : `` Because a bunch of lemming investors give it value by equating 'big with lots of users ' to 'has a valid business model and can make money . ' ''

UPDATE : According to WhatsApp , normal service has been resumed . The company tweeted : `` WhatsApp service has been restored . We are so sorry for the downtime ... '' Original report continues below ... US $ 19 billion can buy you a lot of things , but it ca n't buy you a messaging application that 's completely immune to ocassional server issues . Just days after being snapped up by Facebook , WhatsApp fell over on Saturday and , at the time of writing ( 10pm UK time , 5pm EST , 9am ACT ) has been out of commission for over two hours . The company took to Twitter to confirm the service-wide outage , which is its first major issue since December 2013 . It wrote : `` Sorry [ we 're ] currently experiencing server issues . We hope to be back up and recovered shortly . '' While it 's likely the service will be up and running again before too much longer , it 's probably not what Facebook envisioned when it announced one of the largest acquisitions in tech history on Wednesday . As a result of the WhatsApp outage , rival service Telegram Messenger is reporting record registrations and has been unable to cope with the demand . `` This is crazy . We 're getting 100 new registrations every second . Trying hard to prevent connection issues in Europe , '' the company tweeted .

Facebook is where many people document the minutiae of everyday life , but what happens to a person 's profile when he or she dies ? That 's a question that 's been asked many times before , but now it looks like Facebook may finally have a solution . Previously Facebook would lock the accounts of users who passed so that only people who were friends with that person could see their profiles , but now profiles will simply remain as they are , honoring the deceased person 's existing privacy settings . `` We are respecting the choices a person made in life while giving their extended community of family and friends ongoing visibility to the same content they could always see , '' Facebook 's Chris Price and Alex DiSclafani wrote in an announcement . In addition , Facebook will now allow family members to view lost loved ones ' `` Look Back '' videos -recently introduced custom montages that broadly document users ' lives since they began using the site . This move was spurred by the pleas of one grieving father , John Berlin , who created a video in early February asking Facebook to let him see his late son 's Look Back . More than a week after posting the video , Berlin commented on YouTube that Facebook had sent him the video . Upon learning today 's news , he wrote , `` Facebook did it . They made the change , thx to everyone for your support in making my request heard . '' You can contact Facebook directly to request a Look Back video for other memorialized accounts . `` Over the past several months , we 've been thinking about and working on better ways for people to remember loved ones , '' Price and DiSclafani wrote . `` As we continue to think through each aspect of memorialization , we ask ourselves questions that have no easy answers : How might people feel ? Are we honoring the wishes and legacy of the person who passed away ? Are we serving people who are grieving the loss of a loved one as best we can ? '' They continued , `` We will have more to share in the coming months as we continue to think through how best to help people decide how they want to be remembered and what they want to leave behind for loved ones . ''
What 's the emoji for 19 billion dollars ? Whatever it is , the founders of WhatsApp are no doubt using it again and again : this week it went from being a Facebook rival to being part of Facebook . Facebook is technically $ 19 billion poorer ( although the bulk of the deal is in Facebook stock ) , and in return it 's getting a service with 450 million users and explosive growth . What 's going on ? Matt Swider knows . It 's all about the developing world , where WhatsApp is huge . `` While the social network reaches 1.23 billion monthly active users , it 's approached saturation in the developed world , '' Swider says . `` Who do you know who does n't have Facebook ? '' Facebook is `` transforming its mobile presence with standalone apps and company takeovers , '' Swider says , and that 's fascinating : as Gary Marshall notes , while Facebook can not possibly be the best , most popular service in every sector , `` it can buy the best , most popular services in every sector… and if it 's smart , it wo n't try to assimilate them , integrate them or otherwise mess them up as the previous generation of tech giants - * cough * Yahoo ! * cough * - so loved to do . '' That makes Facebook almost `` unkillable '' , a strategy of `` if you ca n't beat 'em , buy 'em '' that means rivals `` do n't just have to invent a better product and attract millions of users . They also need to be unbuyable at any price . '' If you 're worried about WhatsApp 's new owners , there are plenty of apps that 'll happily sign you up . We 've collated the very best iPhone messaging apps here , and the best Android ones here . Facebook is n't the only firm people have mixed feelings about . Google Glass is n't universally admired either , and this week Google produced nine commandments to make everybody love its oft-hated headset . Kate Solomon is n't amused . `` Thanks for reminding us not to be creeps , Google ! '' she says , pointing out that `` the fact that Google thinks you need 'do n't be a creep ' spelled out to you is patronising '' - and of course , the people who actually are creeps wo n't be listening anyway . It 's nearly spring , and that means just one thing : new phones ! Pick of the bunch is likely to be the Samsung Galaxy S5 , whose imminent launch has created so many leaks we 're thinking of buying some sandbags . The latest reports suggest an interesting new camera with a 16MP sensor , the ability to shoot 4K video and a fancy new flash . Samsung may be hogging the headlines this week , but next week 's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona will feature a keynote by Mark Zuckerberg and more new phones than you can shake a stick at . Do we have the details ? You bet we have , and they 're all here . As with most trade shows , some firms are jumping the gun to announce products early . This year 's culprit is LG , whose G2 Mini is now official . The name 's a little misleading - the Mini has a 4.7-inch screen , which is n't exactly mini - and the specs are hardly spectacular , but it 's nice enough and runs Android 4.4 KitKat . Remember when Nike unveiled Back to the Future trainers back in 2011 ? If like us you were disappointed that they did n't have the self-tightening tech you saw in the movie , we have great news : it 's coming next year , or in about five minutes if you have a DeLorean . `` Are we going to see Power Laces in 2015 ? To that , I say yes ! '' Nike 's Tinker Hatfield says . Sadly there 's still no sign of a working hoverboard . Maybe Mark Zuckerberg could invest in that .

It 's 1999 and Mark Zuckerberg is CEO of Microsoft , despite only being fifteen . Microsoft 's board is rapt as they await his decision . `` Buy it , '' he says . `` Whatever it costs . Whatever they ask for . Buy it . '' He 's talking about Google , a small company that 's doing clever things with search . Like Hotmail , which Microsoft bought the previous year , it might be the shape of things to come - and if it is , it 's a business Microsoft wants to be in . The Google sale would n't be the last time Microsoft appeared to pay over the odds for technology firms . Zuckerberg would go on to arrange the purchase of Android Inc and Flickr in 2005 , YouTube in 2006 and Firefox - or at least most of its key engineers via financial offers they 'd be mad to refuse - in 2008 . It acquired Twitter in 2008 , Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 . The companies were very different , but the rationale for buying them was always the same . As Zuckerberg put it : `` If you ca n't beat 'em , buy 'em . '' It 's made Microsoft the most valuable company the world has ever seen . None of that happened , of course , but if it had then today 's technology industry would look very different - and that 's because Facebook is a very different company to the tech giants of the late 1990s and early 2000s . Facebook has both enormous scale and huge paranoia , and that means it does interesting things such as buying WhatsApp . Facebook may have overpaid - although at around $ 40 per user what it 's paying for WhatsApp is much the same as what Microsoft paid for Hotmail ; most of the deal is in stock , so if we are indeed in a bubble then Facebook wo n't be too out of pocket if the market crashes - but it makes complete sense if you 're absolutely loaded and worried about younger , smarter competitors eating your lunch . By buying WhatsApp Facebook is n't just making a fairly safe investment - WhatsApp 's fee of $ 1 per user per year is serious money if its current explosive growth continues , and the $ 4bn of actual cash Facebook is shelling out will be recouped in a couple of years even if it does n't - but neutralising and monetising a potential competitor . I 've written before that Facebook can not possibly be the best , most popular service in every sector . What it can do , though , is buy the best , most popular services in every sector : Instagram in photos , WhatsApp in messaging and so on . And if it 's smart , it wo n't try to assimilate them , integrate them or otherwise mess them up as the previous generation of tech giants - * cough * Yahoo ! * cough * - so loved to do . Mark Zuckerberg is trying very hard to make Facebook an unkillable business . It might not work - even Facebook ca n't buy everything , and it might not necessarily buy the right businesses ; some pundits are already suggesting that instead of WhatsApp , LINE might have been a better buy - but the beat 'em or buy 'em strategy makes it very tough to compete with . Rivals do n't just have to invent a better product and attract millions of users : they also need to be unbuyable at any price .
Facebook 's purchase of WhatsApp for $ 16 billion ( about £9.5b/AU $ 17.7b ) is n't supposed to change the popular instant messaging app , but it certainly changes the landscape of the real-time messaging services . That 's because the world 's No . 1 social network just bought its way into the hands WhatsApp 's engaged usersbase , which according to Mark Zuckerberg is on a path to one billion people . But more than the sheer number WhatsApp chatters , Facebook appears to be interested in the fact that many of the active users of this SMS-alternative are from developing countries . `` WhatsApp I think is the clear global leader , '' said Zuckerberg in a conference call following the WhatsApp acquisition announcement . `` There are countries [ like ] Korea or Japan where another messaging service is bigger , but if you look across the world , WhatsApp - across Europe , Latin America , India , a lot of places in Asia - is the clear leader . '' International growth , especially in the developing world , is something that Facebook has been stressing in its financial conference calls every quarter for the past year and a half . That 's likely because while the social network reaches 1.23 billion monthly active users , it 's approached saturation in the developed world . Who do you know who does n't have Facebook ? Facebook 's Internet.org campaign in partnership with Samsung , Nokia , Qualcomm and other tech companies is intended to bring affordable internet access for that very reason . It occupies more than one billion `` chairs , '' but what about the internet-deprived who ca n't afford or do n't have access to one ? They deserve a seat that the table , and besides Internet.org , the SMS-snubbing WhatsApp is one way to bring them into the Facebook ( and internet-at-large ) fold . `` About 11 days ago , '' recounted Zuckerberg , `` I proposed that if [ Facebook and WhatsApp ] joined , that would help connect the rest of the world and could help out with things like Internet.org by bringing these two very different communication tools together . '' At the same time WhatsApp is on an unchanged course toward one billion users , Facebook is transforming its mobile presence with standalone apps and company takeovers . Within Apple 's iOS App Store and the Google Play Store , you 'll find Facebook has developed its own Messenger , Flipboard-style Paper , Snapchat-clone Poke and Instagram-esque Camera apps . Prior to today , no app has been more important than Instagram , which Facebook bought last year for $ 1 billion ( about £599m , AU $ 1.1b ) in cash and stock , and has kept its promise of keeping intact . It has n't merged the popular photo- and video-sharing service with its long-forgotten Camera app . `` WhatsApp is going to operate independently , '' reiterated Zuckerberg during today 's call . `` We want to do this the same we did Instagram . This is obvious a bigger scale - a much bigger scale . `` I think [ Instagram Co-Founder ] Kevin [ Systrom ] would say that he 's gotten a huge amount of value out of being able to use Facebook infrastructure . That 's been very valuable to him in scaling . That 's going to be the model here too . '' Zuckerberg stated that Facebook 's `` explicit '' WhatsApp strategy is to focus on growing and connecting everyone in the world . But it also stands to be very profitable . `` Services in the world that have a billion people using them are all incredibly valuable , '' he said . This sort of mobile growth has been the steadfast goal of the social network for the last two years , and it has recently begun to see more profit from its mobile app initiatives than computers . That does n't mean you should expect WhatsApps ads anytime soon . The creators of this subscription-based messenger have long been against delivering ads , and Zuckerberg says he shares this stance , for messaging platforms at least . `` Once we get to being a service that has a billion , two billion , three billion people one day , there are many clear ways we can monetize , '' he said without giving further details . The vision of three billion people using WhatsApp seems like a far way off when it only has 450 million monthly active users , but it achieved that figure within just four years , more than 2.8 times faster than Facebook did . Facebook execs did n't have statistics about the potential overlap between WhatApps and Messenger users , but Zuckerberg thinks that the two can co-exist . `` They actually serve fairly different use cases . Messenger evolved from Facebook Chat , which was more of instant messaging , not SMS , and is widely used today are chatting with Facebook friends . And a lot of the messages are n't real-time , almost like a more informal email . `` WhatsApps evolved from evolved from really replacing SMS . It 's a service for very quick and reliable real-time communication with all of your contacts and small groups of people . `` The world needs both , '' he concluded , with an understood emphasis on `` the world .

Even if you 're not a huge fan of Zuckerberg and Co , Facebook has taken a giant step for social media and its users today . An announcement found on the Facebook Diversity page notes that the company wants its users to feel comfortable expressing themselves and that , `` An important part of this is the expression of gender , especially when it extends beyond the definitions of just 'male ' or 'female . ' '' People can now choose `` custom '' when editing their Timeline and even select a pronoun of their choice . Though Facebook is a very public space , users will be able to decide who they want to share the newfound customization with . Custom actually is n't all that customizable after all . There is a space to type in a gender of your choice , but it must be chosen from a predetermined list . It 's likely Facebook is moderating the terms so the public does n't go hog-wild , but some people still feel like their gender is n't represented , and that it 's too restrictive . Regardless , we 're sure options will expand in the future .

There 's been a lot written about how Facebook has continued to adopt Twitter-like features such as hashtags and trending topics , but now it appears the latter is taking a page from the former 's design playbook . Judging by an experimental version of its profile page , currently being tested on a small sample of users , Twitter seems to have taken a shine to the love-it-or-hate-it Facebook Timeline and wants it for its own . First noted by a Mashable staffer , the redesigned profile page appears to take on many aspects of Zuckerberg 's biggest revamp in recent times . From its non-linear layout and focus on content cards rather than a list of text-based tweets , to the positioning of the profile photo , background photo and toolbar , the similarities are quite startling . While it 's not certain whether Twitter ever plans to roll this version of the 'Me ' page to all users beyond this experimental stage , its appearance comes shortly after a tweaked page rollout out to all members . That particular update , which brought a cleaner , clearer and lighter look , was tested for months , so do n't expect Twitter to roll-out this Timeline-like update any time soon . So far the company has n't responded to requests for comment .

It 's been ten years . Ten years since some posh US school nerds developed an exclusive social network for themselves , probably to make the scoring out of ten of their female colleagues ' attractiveness a little bit easier . Then it went global and , because we all sit on computers all day and like looking at photos of other people and gossiping , it somehow became almost compulsory to have a Facebook profile - if only for reassuring people and distant family members you used to know that you 're still not dead . Facebook 's tenth anniversary celebrations saw the social network generating a weird `` Look Back '' greatest hits video compilation , which came across as part interactive funereal wake presentation and part letter from your most obsessed stalker . It was cute , but has Facebook really changed our lives to such an extent that we 'd miss it if it was gone ? It certainly spearheaded the self-obsessed , narcissistic , selfie generation we now see , encouraging the internet warriors of the mid-2000s to emerge from behind their anonymous avatars and start writing online under their actual names . But given how much people hate it - and how many people claim to never even use it - you 'd think Facebook was still used by a handful of kids , not the 1.2 billion people who regularly log in . The bitterness is everywhere . Beneath a workmanlike SEO list feature on the Daily Star , reader Jon Scott came up with an additional way in which Facebook has changed lives over the last decade , suggesting : `` Fact 11 : Facebook has split up more families and ruined more marriages than any other website . '' Only if you leave yourself signed in , Jon . Incognito mode , sign out , delete cache after every visit and it 's all fine . Guardian reader Odl2000 summarized most normal peoples ' feelings toward Facebook with his comment , suggesting that : `` Facebook has become a necessary evil in my life . If I leave I miss out on invites , photos and announcements that now happen only there . '' But he 's not happy about the situation , explaining : `` I stay and I 'm subjected to the gradual and complicit erosion of my privacy and the daily , eye-gougingly boring updates from people I wish you could unfriend , but ca n't because they would take it as an insult akin to me calling their dad a donkey-f * * * * * r . '' Listen up , Odl2000 . There are zones . If you bother working what all the menus and dropdowns do , you can put the boring people into a sort of purgatory feed where they do n't know you secretly hate them and their petty lives . Xarquid joined in with the battle to appear to be the most bored of it all , outlining his lack of affection for the site with : `` The newsfeed is the same old tedium : how many miles someone ran , someone having a go at a motorist who cut them up , moan , bleat , whine ... the new fad of posting links to all these list sites and daft videos with the captions 'brilliant ' or 'you 've got ta see this ' killed it off for me . '' Putting more of a downer on the birthday celebrations is the emerging trend of the `` neknomination , '' a staggeringly dumb new way the kids have found to get drunk , briefly internet famous and , in some extremely sad cases , dead . On the Independent , beneath a quote from Facebook saying that it would n't be banning neknominate pages even in the face of deaths linked to the bizarre boozing trend , there were the sorts of incredibly insensitive comments that show internet users in their worst light . A person shielded behind the anonymous user name of Cos Lettuce said the sad death of a young man is `` Darwinism in action . ''

It 's fair to say Facebook 's personalised 'Look Back ' videos , dished out to users to celebrate it 's tenth birthday , have been a massive hit . However , you ca n't please all of the people all of the time . If you 're one of those folks unhappy about the photos selected by the algorithm ( a friend of TechRadar had a Pepperami 5-pack photo down as a life highlight in his , for example ) , you can now choose your own . As promised upon the initial roll out on Tuesday , Facebook has made the videos editable at https : //www.facebook.com/lookback/edit . Here users can select from their first moments , most liked posts , uploaded photos and the 38 snaps they wish to sit within the photo grid that closes out the video . So , if amid that emotive soundtrack , a photo of your ex , or that good friend you fell-out with showed-up and left you in floods of tears , you can now erase them for happier social media memories . Perhaps then you 'll be able to join the rest of the 1.23 billion people on Facebook and share your new-and-improved Look Back video ? Were you happy with how yours turned out ? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below .

In the past few years Facebook has rapidly grown to attract 1.25 billion users worldwide , make annual profits of $ 1.5 billion and float on the NASDAQ for more than 100 billion dollars . It 's doing something right . The world 's biggest social network recently passed its 10th birthday , and questions are being asked about the outlook for its next 10 years . Whatever the future holds , Facebook has set a great example of how to build an excellent user interface , and that example is one that businesses would do well to take note of . One of the key reasons behind Facebook 's popularity with consumers is the high level of investment – and critical analysis – in its user interface , creating an engaging , positive journey for the user from start to finish and allowing navigation between activities to be simple , intuitive and enjoyable . Unfortunately , `` positive journey '' does not describe the user experience of many internal company systems which tend to be designed for usability and functionality but often fall flat on both counts . Simple tools like instant messenger , to supplement emails , or a central news feed that allows employees to flag relevant developments to their whole team at the click of a button , can go a long way towards improving functionality and user experience simultaneously . Internal business systems should be designed to increase employee engagement and productivity , but the biggest challenge facing new systems tends to be adoption – the very problem Facebook has been so adept at solving . The most common obstacle to adoption is marketing and awareness , however within a business the audience is , by default , captive , so surely it should be relatively easy to encourage internal adoption of new systems ? However , the big struggle that businesses face is to build a system which is functional , engaging and enjoyable to use . There are great rewards available to companies that follow the examples set by popular consumer websites – such as Facebook , Twitter and BuzzFeed - and use these to encourage adoption and integration of the systems that are central to their own business models . Whilst part of the appeal of these sites is the non-commercial content , the user interface should not be underestimated . Plenty of social media competitors attempted to steal the crown of those we all know and use today , but it was those which created and continually evolved the most intuitive and effective user interface which now lead the market . Facebook 's interface is the result of ten years of R & D by some of the best and most well funded minds that Silicon Valley has to offer . Companies wishing to develop their own systems will struggle to find a better source of inspiration . ''

The iPhone-exclusive , US-only Facebook Paper app may never come to other platforms , like Android and iPad - and if it does , it wo n't be any time soon , the social network has confirmed . `` We 're a small team and are excited to see how people use this and what their feedback is , '' a spokesperson told Pocket-lint . As the site points out , that makes it sound like a sort of testing ground for Facebook design , as in , if the feedback to Facebook Paper is positive , Facebook apps across all platforms could theoretically implement a similarly improved layout . Besides , the team working on Facebook Paper in Facebook 's experimental Creative Labs only has 15 members , and that feedback really will be key before they `` expand , '' the company said . Facebook Paper took everyone by surprise when it was announced at the end of January , mostly because it 's so much better than the Facebook news feed we 've come to know . But while fans have called for Facebook to port the app to Android and iPad - not to mention release it outside the US - those pleas are apparently falling on deaf ears . After how stale Facebook is beginning to look and how much ire the company drew in 2013 with moves like news feed ads and Facebook Home , you 'd think they 'd jump at the chance to provide users with something they actually want . It 's a bit ironic , is n't it ? Still , if Facebook Paper 's try-outs on US iPhones result in positive changes across every platform and region , then the wait just may be worth it .

More than 757 million people will pay Facebook a visit on its 10th birthday , which is more adulation than some deities receive . Whether you 're among those making a personal pilgrimage or not , Facebook is like Christmas and X Factor winners - it 's absolutely impossible to ignore . The social network , famously conceived exactly a decade ago in a Harvard University dorm room , has grown to permeate practically every other room in the western world . It has developed omnipresence and , in our sphere , only Google can really claim to have similar cultural sway in the 21st century . It is no exaggeration to say it has changed the way we communicate . But the journey to global dominance and 1.23 billion loyal disciples has n't exactly been smooth sailing for young Mark Zuckerberg and his band of social warriors . Since it arrived to unseat an asleep-at-the-wheel MySpace all those years ago . There have been endless lawsuits , innumerable privacy scandals , an initially disastrous stock market floatation , constant forecasts of its demise and near-riots from users whenever the firm makes the slightest unwelcome change . It ai n't easy being King , but it sure does pay well . Here 's a look back at some of the ups and downs of the last 10 years . We all know how the story behind company got its start , in 2004 , as an inter-university social tool called `` The Facebook . '' With its initial exclusivity to Ivy League college students , Facebook was able to build huge intrigue and demand , among those who were n't permitted access . When it arrived on other collages and high schools campuses around the world , people could n't wait to join this exclusive club and when it finally opened the floodgates to the public in September 2006 ? Forget about it . With the integrated option to post photos - something legend claims Zuckerberg was dead set against - users began gravitating over from MySpace , which had become a mismanaged , stale , spam-infested relic of bad web design . 2004-2005 Feb 2004 : Facebook is launched at Harvard Dec 2004 : Reaches 1 million members Oct 2005 : Launch of Facebook photos Whereas the once-kingly MySpace failed to adapt to user demands , Facebook allowed its company 's path to follow them . It rapidly added new features like private messaging , the almighty news feed , Pages , popular games like Farmville , video , Places and the Facebook Platform API that allowed third parties to build their own tools for the site . By the end of December 2007 it had reached 58 million people . While some say MySpace 's death warrant was signed when it handed over the reins to News Corp , Facebook just about avoided big corporate interference at a key time in its existence . In 2008 , Zuckerberg famously turned down an acquisition offer from Yahoo , while Facebook was still a loss-making company . So the story goes , the boss was into the idea until Yahoo whiffed on its offer and dropped it from $ 1 billion to $ 800m . Today Facebook company is worth 150 times that and spending billions on acquiring start ups itself . No company enjoys such exponential growth without enduring the occasional controversy . Facebook has had its fair share of both . In those early years , the discourse was dominated by one giant unfriending as the brothers Winklevoss dragged their assertion that Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook through the courts . The tenacious twins eventually got $ 65m in compensation for their troubles ( which they spent on Bitcoin ) , but Zuck has never quite manage to delete that asterisk against his , and Facebook 's reputation . It 's presence has perhaps been etched in permanent ink thanks to the myriad of privacy violations attached to Facebook . While the company practically encourages the over-sharing of our personal activity , it has n't been a paradigm of responsibility when it comes to safeguarding that data . 2006 April 2006 : Facebook for mobile launches Sept 2006 : Launch of News Feed Sept 2006 : Facebook is open to everyone In 2007 , the company launched Beacon , a means of connecting online purchases to Facebook accounts . That was all well and good until purchases of engagement rings and Christmas presents started showing up on users ' walls .
There 's a little more transparency in the US government 's cloaked internet affairs , as tech giants are now able to disclose more information regarding government data requests . For the first time , Google , Facebook , Microsoft , Yahoo and others able to reveal the volumes of both National Security Letters and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act they have received . The requests have forced these companies to turn over personal information of their online account holders . It 's not exactly what internet users signed up for , though the numbers do remain small . `` Only a fraction of a percent of our users are affected by these orders , '' surmised Brad Smith , Microsoft 's executive vice president of legal and corporate affairs . `` In short , this means that we have not received the type of bulk data requests that are commonly discussed publicly regarding telephone records '' These internet companies , many with upwards of a billion users each , have been lobbying the government to ease its gag order on the information they can reveal to the public . The new data discloses the number of requests and how many users or accounts were affected in total , but it 's on a six-month delay . This is just the tipping point for these companies . `` More transparency is needed so everyone can better understand how surveillance laws work and decide whether or not they serve the public interest , '' wrote Richard Salgado , Google legal director . Further details like specific types of requests received and number of users they affect are desired . As Microsoft pointed out , today 's numbers are sourced from government requests made through the proper channels . `` Nothing in today 's report minimizes the significance of efforts by governments to obtain customer information outside legal process , '' noted Smith . `` Purported hacking of cables running between data centers of some of our competitors [ has ] been and remains a major concern across the tech sector . '' To that point , last month , it was alleged that British spies have penetrated fiber optic cables to collect YouTube views and Facebook `` like '' data in order to prevent overseas protests . The British intelligence service GCHQ reportedly passed its methods along to its counterparts in the US , the Prism-linked NSA .

Facebook is testing out the Graph Search functionality for mobile devices , according to at least one user who is seeing the update land on their handset . The limited was first reported by a Mashable scribe this weekend and follows Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's recent vow to bring the contextual searches to mobile users sooner rather than later . During last week 's quarterly earnings call the CEO said : `` We 're really early in the game on this . You can see that because we have n't even really rolled out our mobile version of graph search yet and we 're a mobile company . `` Pretty soon , you should expect us to roll out the mobile version of this . I think that 's going to be an important step because most of the usage of Facebook overall is on mobile . '' The enhanced search took , which allows users to discover posts , photos , restaurant recommendations and more rolled out to all users in July last year . It 's a fairly decent tool for finding photos of you and your friends , your friends who live in particular cities , or even friends who 've been posting about certain subjects . As Zuckerberg said , the company is 'early in the game ' with Graph Search and it 'll only improve as time progresses . That improvement will continue with the wider roll out on mobile devices .

The `` good '' and `` evil '' sides of the tech world clashed this week , with the clean-shaven , youthful and extremely popular makers of the Oculus Rift VR headset agreeing to be purchased by the evil , goatee-bearded , dark forces of the hated Facebook mega-empire . Many toys were thrown out of prams and as we see every week , there 's always one joke everyone furiously types out and thinks they 're the first with . This week , it was something along the lines of `` FarmVille in 3D ! LOL ! '' that everyone raced to wryly observe first . Plus the fact that legendary PC coder and unmitigated brainbox John Carmack is now a humble Facebook employee caused many simple people some low levels of mirth . These jokes were even funnier when they were repeated the next day , becoming funnier still by the third day . But mostly there was anger . Anger about Kickstarter being used to kickstart a $ 2bn business , anger at Facebook chucking its money around again and anger that the promising VR tech may eventually be used as little more than a new way to get your mum to click on adverts for discounted last-minute cruises around the Norwegian fjords . Those writing beneath a Valleywag piece suggested Facebook was the `` worst possible partner '' for the VR firm , fury was vented by those who saw Oculus using Kickstarter as a method of not only building a project , but building a company worth $ 2bn in a couple of years . This was accurately nutshelled by commenter I 'm Here Mostly for the Chicks , who said : `` At this point it 's safe to assume Kickstarter in its entirety is for suckers . Maybe the first few months it was a good outlet for homebrew ideas , but all you 're doing now is subsidising corporations so they do n't have to take risks . '' Reader Greensky was a little more generous about his criticism of the deal , suggesting : `` Kickstarter has led people to believe that they 're investing in an independent company . That their contributions are vital in allowing them to get off the ground and to forge their own way . Oculus proves that there can also be Kickstarters whose sole goal is to become popular enough to sell . Which is n't wrong per se , but it 's also not the nice heart-warming underdog story that most Kickstarters use to get more backers . '' On a more aggressively negative vibe was Economist reader Guest Sensation , who said : `` The very last thing humanity needs is a life sucking screen strapped to its face . What a shame people are embracing this technological 'advancement ' . Bye bye family time , hello 3D porn , virtual worlds to waste your life in , and mass media control . Disgusting . '' There 's 3D porn ? * Writes cheque for $ 2.5bn , phones bank to arrange overdraft facility * This is all a sign that Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has gone bonkers and is currently on a cash-fuelled spree he 'll eventually come to regret , according to Pondbridge72 , who raged : `` Paying twice the market price for Instagram and then WhatsApp was one thing . But this latest digression into geek hardware while alienating the very gamers necessary for Oculus to succeed is ham-fisted at best . Florid 5 and 10 year visions disguise an I-know-better-than-the-market intellectual arrogance and inability/unwillingness to take counsel from others . '' Just looked up what `` florid '' means . It 's a real word . It means `` excessively intricate or elaborate . '' Nice one , Pondbridge , teaching people about online fury and English at the same time . STR agreed and was baffled by the decision , eventually concluding : `` This is a case study in why no investor should trust their money with a company who has a 29 year old with sole majority control . '' But not everyone 's entirely negative about the sale . $ 2bn is a lot of money , and Register reader Stu is fantasising about how it might be spent by the newly loaded Oculus team , dreaming : `` Well I 've pre-ordered DK2 , and am thinking of cancelling , but I 'm coming to realise that Facebook have injected a serious cash flow into Oculus , hence would have a lot more clout in the HW market to demand the screens and other tech they want - specifically it would benefit from curved OLED , ultra resolution , very low latency , and very low persistence . '' Stu then suggests creating a throwaway Facebook profile to use solely for Oculus ( and perhaps Tinder at the weekends ) , although he adds : `` Adverts , well if that happens then I 'm out ! '' Beneath a Guardian piece entirely structured around how bad an idea it all seems , comment turned to whether or not Kickstarter backers ought to get a cut of the $ 2bn , seeing as they are , in some small way , the original venture capitalists that set Oculus on its way to financial stardom . Reader Unpleasantmilk contributed the observation that : `` People put money into it , to help the company build . Now that company has been sold for billions , why should n't those who helped make it so , profit ? This leaves a bad taste , but that is no surprise if * uckerburg is involved . '' And ChrisKS was n't happy with Oculus either , raging : `` Oculus did exactly the opposite of what Kickstarter is used for , and did n't actually do what their stated aims were . Look at their Kickstarter campaign and you 'll see that the support was generated by promises of open-sourcing and prototypes being built to facilitate/accelerate games development . '' `` It was NOT supposed to be their engine for personal enrichment , but that 's what they used all that money for , '' he finished with , probably hitting the keyboard really hard and with a satisfied flourish on that final full stop . Finally , Facebook 's flaw of letting the most thumbed-up comments float up to the top of response threads meant Zuckerberg 's own announcement of the Oculus deal was instantly hammered by negativity , with Dave Woodruff rising to internet fame with his 1,000+ liked satirical comment : `` I 'm excited to announce we ca n't innovate but we can buy other companies .

In every game generation , there 's one title that is destined to define it . One game that will go down in the books of gaming history and shape what 's yet to come . A game that promises to have huge ( wait for it ) ram-ifications . We do n't want to speak too soon but we 're pretty sure that game is Goat Simulator . And this week the hype train shifted up a gear as we were treated to this brand new trailer - a big wink to the famed Dead Island teaser . The game will be available for Windows on April 1 via Steam , and right now it has all the promises of a cult classic . In case you 're not already familiar with the concept , the aim of the game is to destroy things by head-butting them , thus earning yourself points . But a finely-tuned , narrative-driven game this is not . Goat Simulator is broken , silly , and very , very strange . Headbutt-a-gas-station-to-get-a-Michael-Bay-achievement strange . Almighty goat of all that is goaty , we surrender ourselves to your sacred bovid-ness . Goats not your thing ? ( weirdo ) Then have we got the alternative animal simulator for you . A slightly less goaty , but equally important event also took place this week . You might have heard about it : it involved a kickstart project , a social network , and the collective sound of every gamer 's dreams shattering in unison . That might be a tad dramatic but it was still a pretty big deal nonetheless . Yes , we 're talking about the news that Facebook will acquire Oculus Rift in one of the most unexpected tech land grabs that we can recall . The startup tipped to be the saviour of VR has just been swallowed by a global conglomerate - it was never going to go down well with the gamers . And sure enough , the internet responded with vitriol , with a number of people going so far as to demand their money back . You can understand why people are questioning this move : Facebook is n't a gaming company , so does it really care about immersive gaming technology ? It 's certainly made no secret of the fact it plans to extend VR well beyond that remit and into 'social VR ' . But the move will obviously be beneficial to Oculus ; it now has more resources to pump into its project and should be able to get it out of the door faster than originally anticipated . That is , if Facebook does n't choose to meddle too much . Oculus has done this deal before we 've even seen a market product so the widespread concern is understandable . We just have to cross our fingers that work on the Oculus project continues to push ahead mostly independently , and that Palmer Luckey and his team have n't forgotten that while VR will undoubtedly bring awesomeness to so many other remits , gaming needs to stay the priority . As both Zack Snyder 's Batman vs Superman movie and Warner Bros ' Gotham TV series begin to come together , we 're preparing ourselves for a post-Nolan Batverse . And what better way to ease us in than Rocksteady Studios ' next ( and final ) Batman outing ? Batman : Arkham Knight arrives later this year , and we got to chat to Rocksteady about bringing the Arkham series to a thrilling conclusion . Of course , it 's the drivable Batmobile that we wanted to know most about . Rocksteady 's Gaz Deaves summed it up nicely : `` We wanted to build this big , open Gotham… and smash it up '' . That was all we needed to hear - we might as well have handed over our wallets right then and left the room - but we stuck around to talk a bit more about how the next-gen Batman is shaping up .

We 're very glad HTC is better at making phones than it is at coming up with product names . The HTC One , of which there are many , has a brand new version that might just be the best phone you can buy . The HTC One M8 is going head to head with the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Sony Xperia Z2 , and it 's the best thing HTC has ever done . If you asked smartphone superhero Gareth Beavis to review the HTC One M8 in a single word , that word would be `` stunning '' . Give him more words and he 'll add that it `` takes the superb DNA of last year 's device , improves it in nearly every area and then packs it full of all the latest technology ... and still finds space to pack in a microSD card slot . '' The M8 `` can compete with Samsung on the technological front yet still stand toe-to-toe with Apple , arguably the producer of some of the best-looking devices of all time . '' There 's a big problem with the M8 , though , and it 's the same problem that 's plagued HTC 's previous flagships : while HTC is rather good at making smartphones , it 's bloody awful at selling them . According to Gareth Beavis the campaign for the HTC One was `` the equivalent of Mercedes launching a new high end saloon by filling it with clowns and having all the wheels fall off . '' That 's a worry , because `` HTC needs to do more than make a phone that can go toe-to-toe with Apple and Samsung – and win . It has to show the world , convincingly , that it can do so , and it needs to somehow work out a way to do it with a fraction of the marketing budget of its rivals . '' HTC 's troubles wo n't be solved by a fairly popular phone : it needs a genuine global hit . We hope the marketing is as good as the M8 . What 's worse than being boiled alive or eaten by sharks ? Judging by the reaction to Oculus 's big bombshell this week , being bought by Facebook is worse than both of those things put together . In classic `` I liked the product so much I bought the company '' style , Zuckerberg 's outfit has bought what might just be the googly-eyed future of everything . As you might expect , many of the Oculus Rift 's Kickstarter backers were n't happy . The waaaaambulances were quickly despatched to aid people apparently unaware that Kickstarter offers all the expense of venture funding , without any of the rewards or guarantees . The first lawsuit is probably being filed as you read this . So what does the acquisition actually mean for the VR hero ? As Hugh Langley reports , it 's not suddenly going to become FaceFace . But the sale and its backlash is a massive PR boost for Sony , whose own VR headset will go on sale this year . Even your gran will be excited by the coming wave of VR , predicts Phil Iwaniuk : `` the really exciting thing about video games is the possibility of exploring an imaginary place , and VR 's killer feature – as Sony states – is the chance to be present in it as never before . '' Fancy using VR to drive really futuristic cars ? We 've got a better idea : why not drive really futuristic cars in the real world , on real roads ? That 's what Audi 's offering in the form of the new TT , and Jeremy Laird has the low-down on the `` all round techno-mastery '' the coupe offers . Fasten your seatbelt , because it 's a big list : `` High-res LCD panels , twin quad-core CPUs , 4G data , touch control , natural-language voice recognition , iOS-aping search functionality , intelligent auto-dimming headlights , hybrid aluminium and steel construction , computer-controlled four-wheel drive . '' Yours for an unspecified ( but presumably very large ) sum of money later this year .

While everyone 's distracted by looking through virtual reality goggles like Oculus Rift , Facebook is preparing to fly drones overhead to beam the internet to new places . This airborne Internet.org mission is being carried out by the Facebook Connectivity Lab , which has been tasked with building drones , satellites and lasers . Its goal is to deliver `` affordable access to basic internet services available to every person in the world , '' wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a status update . There 's certainly a need . Less than three billion people are able to access the internet among a population of 7.1 billion . Penetration is low in developing countries without infrastructure and government censorship often stymies free and open access . Turkey is just the latest case this month . Facebook and Internet.org have been able to connect more than three million new people to the internet in the past year through conventional methods . Countries like the Philippines and Paraguay have seen double the number of mobile data users thanks to the Internet.org 's partnerships with operators , reported Zuckerberg . That 's a start , but beaming the internet to the entire world requires inventing new technology and experts . That 's why Facebook is bringing experts from NASA 's Jet Propulsion Lab and Ames Research Center onboard as well as key members of the UK-based Ascenta to its Connectivity Lab . Ascenta is known for being involved in its early stages Zephyr , a UAV technology that went on to become the world 's longest flying solar-powered unmanned aircraft . This fits right into the scope of Internet.org 's plains , which call for internet delivery at 60,000 feet in the air with planes that are powered by the sun .
At the end of Animal Farm - spoiler alert if you 've been asleep since the 1940s - the creatures looked from pig to man , and from man to pig , and from pig to man again , but already it was impossible to say which was which . Anyone else imagining Twitter and Facebook ? No ? Bear with me on this one . In its ongoing quest to be a lot less Twitter and a lot more Facebook , a plan that will probably end up with Twitter calling itself BookFace and upsetting the internet by ruining a VR firm , Twitter is considering renaming retweets as Shares . Apparently the problem is that the concept of retweets is too difficult for some people to get their heads around - and what Twitter really needs right now is more of those people , the kind of folk who still point at planes . You can see where this is heading . Twitter now has photo tagging and multiple photo uploads , and it 's considering dumping the @ symbol in replies . Twitter has also been testing what looks awfully like a Facebook interface , so it 's just a matter of time before your Twitter feed fills with baby photos and racism . The inspiration runs both ways , of course . Facebook has yet to meet a good idea it did n't want to buy or copy . Soon we 'll look from Facebook to Twitter , and from Twitter to Facebook , and it 'll be impossible to say which is which . Does this high-tech homogeneity matter ? I think it does , to Twitter 's detriment . As social networks go , Twitter 's learning curve is steeper than most : I 'm sure many people checked it out , could n't make head nor tail of the @ this and the RT-that , and wandered off again . But what Twitter 's up to here is n't just about addressing the learning curve , it 's about monetisation . Twitter wants to get more users of the ad-clicky variety and it wants them to do more on the service so it can have more money . The problem with that kind of strategy is that it dilutes the service 's special sauce . For me , the big appeal of Twitter is its speed and simplicity , the lack of cruft and clutter , the sheer unFacebookness of it . The more Facebook-y it becomes , the less special it is . This is n't new , of course , and it is n't just a tech thing . It 's your favourite underground act moving up to stadiums , sacrificing the quirks and nuances and sharp edges that made you fall in love with them in the first place . It 's your favourite down-to-earth actor moving to LA and becoming just another botoxed automaton . It 's your favourite TV show jumping the shark . It 's what happens when you get big money and the big expectations that go with it . It 's understandable - investors do n't just want success , they demand growth - but it 's dangerous too . If you sacrifice your core audience and go chasing the mass market , then if that market moves elsewhere you have nothing to fall back on - and if all you have to offer the mass market is a me-too version of a bigger , more paranoid and richer rival , then you could all too easily find yourself outgunned , outspent and outnumbered . Twitter is a wonderful thing . It 'd be a shame to see it end up scrabbling for Facebook 's table scraps .

AI firm , Vicarious FPC , has received substantial backing from Mark Zuckerberg , Elon Musk and Ashton Kutcher , who have come together to invest $ 40 million ( £24 million , AU $ 43 million ) in the AI company . The company hopes to replicate the section of the brain which controls the senses of the body , known as the neo-cortex in code , and understands language and mathematics . If successful , it will be the nearest yet humans will have come to replicate a human brain in silicon . The interest from big firms is understandable , and though computers with human brain compute capacity may be decades away , Facebook certainly has a more present goal in mind . Zuckerberg , according to a report from the Wall Street Journal , wants to turn Facebook into a database where questions can be instantaneously answered . Vicarious is , however , a long way from accomplishing even its initial goals , let alone its loftier ambitions of using AI to cure disease and create renewable energy . Co-founder Scott Phoenix has said that Vicarious wo n't even be close to making a profit for many years . The firm has also said little and less about its tech and any details of its work , and even refuses to disclose its HQ 's address for fear of espionage . Other backers of the AI company include Paypal founder Peter Thei and Dustin Moskovitz . Both Elon Musk and Ashton Kutcher have refused comment .
Update : Facebook has issued a denial that it plans to put its logo and interface on Oculus Rift , rebuffing The New York Times ' anonymous source 's claim . A Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch that the claim is `` not true and not in the spirit of our relationship [ with Oculus ] . '' Facebook is expected to endow the Oculus team with plenty of resources to help bring its product ( and more services ) to fruition , but it 's maintained Oculus will continue to operate independently . We 'll keep an eye on any further developments . As it stands , plenty of people are unhappy with Facebook 's takeover of the VR company . Original article below ... Gamers are going to be left feeling blue in more ways than one if claims of an Oculus Rift redesign are to be believed . The New York Times cites an anonymous source in the know who claims that Facebook plans to eventually redesign the Rift 's hardware – and rebrand it with the Facebook logo . On top of that , the headset will also get a `` Facebook interface '' , the tipster claims . Could that be an operating system of sorts ? It 's a little unclear . The $ 2 billion acquisition has already caused a severe amount of backlash from the gaming community . And the latest news , if true , is n't going to do either Oculus or Facebook any more favours - especially as Oculus said it would continue to act largely independent going forward . Still , the source is anonymous and apparently `` not authorised '' by either company to speak publicly , so wait for something more official before you start sharpening those pitchforks .
I expect my reaction to Facebook 's Oculus VR acquisition was just as dumbfounded as yours . But more than anything , it annoyed me . It annoyed me because , as an early advocate of Oculus Rift , I 've watched a Kickstarter success evolve into a thriving passion project that has the potential to change the way we game . And it just handed itself over to a data-chomping , Farmville-loving conglomerate before even getting off the ground . But this is n't just about Facebook and Oculus . It feels like it 's becoming rarer to see promising smaller players evolve into something much bigger without being snapped up by a Goliath first . Nest and Google . Instagram and Facebook . Nokia and Microsoft . Oh yeah , and Facebook and Whatsapp . Nothing is sacred . Everything is an asset waiting to be scooped up and it 's going to get more aggressive as we phase out of a recession . I do n't want to live in a world where Google , Apple and Facebook need to own everything . Nest had the potential to be huge as an independent entity , as did Oculus . Imagine how many more $ each could have had to their name in a few years time had they gone it alone . They 'd also be very different companies . But it 's also bad news for the competition . Facebook has just made a reasonably level playing field pretty uneven , meaning it may now be a lot more difficult for other VR companies to jump in ( Sony 's Project Morpheus possibly less so , given that it 's built solely for the PS4 ) . Just look at Spotify 's purchase of The Echo Nest and the ramifications that 's already having for Rdio and other music services . And the more it happens , the more people get paranoid about these big companies eating , processing and spitting out their data to third parties . People have become skeptical of Facebook 's respect for privacy and now Oculus stands in that shadow . It 's a shame . Is Oculus still the virtual reality saviour for the gamers ? Oculus says the day-to-day activities wo n't change ; I ca n't help but question its independence in the long run but I hope I 'm wrong . In the conference call yesterday , Zuckerberg described Whatsapp and Oculus as `` rare '' entities . He 's right , and that only makes watching these acquisitions all the more disheartening . I want to see these rarities grow into their own . Otherwise everything becomes so much less exciting .
An Oculus Rift version of Minecraft was in the works ... until Facebook bought up Oculus VR for US $ 2 billion . Posting on Twitter , Minecraft creator Markus Persson wrote , `` We were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus . I just cancelled that deal . '' Why ? `` Facebook creeps me out , '' Persson added in the tweet . He explained his decision further via blog post , stating that he did n't trust the social media platform . `` Their motives are too unclear and shifting , and they have n't historically been a stable platform . There 's nothing about their history that makes me trust them , and that makes them seem creepy to me , '' he said in his blog post . According to Persson , talks about producing a slimmed-down , free version of Minecraft for Oculus began just two weeks ago . Persson 's decision to can the project goes beyond his distrust of Facebook . He went on to say that he thinks VR is perfect for a social platform , but explained that he does n't want to work with social . `` I want to work with games , '' he wrote . `` I definitely want to be a part of VR , but I will not work with Facebook . '' All may not be lost , however . With Sony revealing their own VR headset , Project Morpheus , and Microsoft hinting that it has its sights on VR for Xbox as well , Persson does have other avenues for a VR version of Minecraft - avenues that are definitely game-centric . Via : The Verge
It still has n't completely sunk in that Facebook bought Oculus , maker of the Oculus Rift VR headset . A social media marriage with virtual reality ? It 's a head-scratcher that 's sure to make the masses furious , confused and compelled to take up arms - meaning we 'll probably see a barrage of snarky internet memes for awhile . The deal struck between the two companies is worth approximately $ 2 billion , ( about £1.2b , AU $ 2.1b ) , and an additional $ 300 million ( about £181m , AU $ 327m ) in earn-out cash and stock will be paid if Oculus hits `` certain milestones . '' With such large sums of dough being doled out , my immediate thought about Facebook buying Oculus is simply that it 's an astoundingly bad idea . It reeks of dump trucks full of easy money for a burgeoning start-up , which admittedly makes sense with the big dogs like Sony 's Project Morpheus in the picture and Microsoft 's wishy-washy VR dabbling . But in all honesty , virtual reality needs as much time in the limelight as it can get if it wants to stay relevant and not fade away like Nintendo 's Virtual Boy , and with the power of Facebook behind it , Oculus is bound to get plenty of air-time . However , relevance does n't necessarily mean opting for a social media company acquisition is the right answer . Public opinion of Oculus is generally high thanks to its modest Kickstarter beginnings . We also ca n't forget Palmer Luckey 's early days participating in MTBS forums ( Meant to Be Seen ) and John Carmack of Doom fame joining the team , furthering the VR startup 's popularity . It 's a textbook tech fairy tale story about the underdog slowly rising to fame . The same can be said for Facebook 's own humble Harvard inception . Both companies have the entrepreneurial spirit that drives the tech industry - but why do we all roll our eyes at the thought of Facebook likes , posts and its numerous layout changes ? There 's no doubt that Facebook 's numbers are big and that its user base is massive - heck everyone and their grandma is on `` the Facebook . '' Yet the mention of the `` F '' word leaves a dirty taste in the mouth . We all use it but we all abuse it , too . The prevalence of social media has become a permanent fixture in our lives , and arguably has been more negative than positive . After all , where else did the selfie generation develop ? And the need to post every mundane aspect of a morning routine ? Or more seriously , the addictive , alienating effects of being on the site all the time ? This makes Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's determination to bring Oculus on board as a means to further the social connection , or in his own words during an analyst call , `` connect the world ... in entirely new ways '' less exciting than a site redesign . No one wants to feel that familiar Facebook animosity for a future-forward device that has such promising capabilities . Or , more frankly , we do n't want to see Facebook screw up a good thing . To be fair , Zuckerberg did say that Oculus will remain an individual operation and will stay in its Irvine , Calif. headquarters to continue tinkering away on the head mounted display . But it 's clear that Zuck and Co. have big plans for the device as well since the CEO stated VR has `` the potential to be the most social platform ever . '' He mentioned sports , education , doctors visits and shopping as just a few of the virtual experiences that are a goggle away with an Oculus at home . This does match up with Oculus Rift 's own goals - to bring immersive VR to every household - but vision is one thing and execution is another . We see what Facebook wants , but from how the social media platform has evolved , it just does n't look very promising . Regardless , if there 's one good thing that must be said , virtual reality is an exciting space that deserves more attention . Meaning if Facebook has to buy Oculus Rift for VR for people to start noticing , so be it . As long as it opens doors for other companies to join the fold and make it big .
Not only is Facebook forking over around $ 2 billion ( about £1.2b , AU $ 2.1b ) for the company that makes Oculus Rift , it 's also stepping out with some pretty heady numbers for its longer-standing properties . First up , Facebook 's first true love : mobile . Zuckerberg revealed Facebook now has 1 billion active users on its mobile apps . The company repeated its December 2013 figure of 945 million monthly users just last week , but clearly it was time for an update . Furthermore , Zuckerberg said that looking at all mobile phone usage , more than 20 % of peoples ' time is spent on Facebook . The company has made much of its `` mobile first '' approach , and it appears to be paying off . As for Instagram , Facebook 's first big payout , the photo sharing service revealed today that it has over 200 million users , with over 50 million of those joining in the last six months . Users sat at 100 million when Facebook purchased the then-tiny team in 2012 . During a call with analysts to discuss the Oculus purchase , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Instagram is `` already ahead of where we want it to be . '' He assured Facebook wo n't make multi-billion dollar purchases every few months a regular thing , but with Instagram growing , WhatsApp expected to reach 1 billion people and Oculus Rift 's potential as the future of computing , there 's certainly some things Zuck is wiling to spend his bucks on .

Facebook is purchasing Oculus VR , maker of the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset . The deal is worth approximately $ 2 billion ( about £1.2b , AU $ 2.1b ) , and an additional $ 300 million ( about £181m , AU $ 327m ) in earn-out cash and stock will be paid for hitting `` certain milestones . '' In a press release , Facebook highlighted Oculus ' leadership in the virtual reality , but noted it plans to help take VR beyond gaming and into spaces like communications , media and entertainment , education and more . During a call with analysts , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Oculus `` has potential to be the most social platform ever . '' The company has historically focused on pushing into mobile , and Zuckerberg said more than 20 % of peoples ' time spent on their phones is spent on Facebook . Now , the social network wants `` to start working on the next major computing platform . '' `` Mobile is the platform of today , and now we 're starting to get ready for the platforms of tomorrow , '' he said . Oculus VR will stay in its Irvine , Calif. headquarters and will continue making the Oculus Rift . During last week 's GDC , the company unveiled its latest version of the headset , Development Kit 2 ( DK2 ) . According to Zuckerberg , Oculus ' has `` big plans '' on the immersive gaming front that are n't going away . In fact , Facebook hopes to accelerate them . The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2014 . The announcement comes a little over a month after Facebook revealed it was purchasing WhatsApp for a cool $ 19 billion ( about £11.4b , AU $ 20.7b ) . During the investor call , Zuckerberg called the Oculus acquisition `` a long-term bet on the future of computing . '' He said the most exciting future platform development is happening around vision , and referred to Oculus VR as the clear leader in VR . Facebook seems unphased by the fact that Oculus has yet to ship a commercial Rift headset , or that others , like Sony , are making forays into the VR space . Zuckerberg said that not only is Oculus `` far ahead '' of other purveyors of VR , he 's ready and willing to see the tech mature over the next 5-10 years . As for a concern many are likely feeling , Zuckerberg admitted advertising could be a way to monetize Oculus headsets , but is something `` we need to figure out down the line . '' The ability to purchase virtual goods using Rift may also be a money-making option . Facebook wo n't try to make a profit off of Oculus Rift `` long term , '' and Zuckerberg described the purchase as really more of `` a software and services thing . '' In the near term , Zuckerberg said , `` the main goal that we have is building out the product , using the different levers that Facebook has to make the product affordable to people , make it ubiquitous and use the different technologies that Facebook has to bring it to market as soon as possible . '' In a Timeline post , Zuckerberg highlighted Oculus Rift 's ability to transport wearers to a new space , one where they feel `` actually present '' with other people . Building immersive gaming experiences is n't going by the wayside , and Zuckerberg reiterated that his company will help Oculus `` build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games . '' But games are only the start ; Facebook will help turn Oculus into a platform for innumerable other experiences . `` This is really a new communication platform , '' Zuckerberg wrote . `` By feeling truly present , you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life . Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online , but entire experiences and adventures . '' Becoming Facebook 's new pet project may not have been conceivable 18 months ago , when Oculus was using foam prototypes to demonstrate its idea . Now it counts more than 75,000 dev kits ordered , and the world 's largest social network has its back . In a blog post , the Oculus team wrote , `` Facebook understands the potential for VR , '' and shares the company 's vision for VR to `` transform the way we learn , share , play and communicate . '' Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe said on the call that the new partnership is `` one of the most important moments for virtual reality , '' one that `` gives us the best shot at truly changing the world . ''
Facebook-owned photo sharing service Instagram is testing a new version of its app , which sees the social network 's Places platform replace Foursquare as the location provider . As of this week , some of app users will notice the `` name this location '' tool sees Foursquare replaced by the in-house Facebook Places option . In a statement , Instagram said users will continue to be able to access Foursquare check-ins , but it 's significant that the Facebook is now in the loop . It would make sense for Facebook to use its own ( not quite as ) effective platform rather than pass the task and the data onto a company is sees as a competitor in the important check in space . Instagram said : `` Foursquare is a great partner , and people will continue to be able to share their check-ins to Foursquare from Instagram . `` We are constantly testing experiences throughout the app to provide the best possible user experience as part of future planning . '' As well as offering its own app and check-in services , Foursquare also passes its location expertise to services like Vine , Instagram , Pinterest and Path . A Foursquare spokesperson said : `` We 've worked with Facebook and Instagram for a while , and they 're great partners . `` Like any company , they 're testing new ways to provide a good user experience , however all users can still share check-ins via Instagram . '' Instagram says otherwise , but are these tests the beginning of the end for Foursquare location tagging for our filtered snaps ? After snapping up the photo-sharing start-up in 2012 , Facebook has slowly made its presence felt , adding advertisements and photo-tagging . Via CNET

Facebook is serious about social . And since , according to Facebook , gaming is social , Zuck 's crew is serious about it , too . The message came through clearer than a Bejeweled gem at this week 's GDC , and the company has made several plays to woo the game-maker crowd here . `` It 's a great time to be working on games at Facebook , '' said Dan Morris , head of North American & Mobile Games Partnerships at Facebook during a media roundtable Wednesday . `` We are increasingly understanding thanks to user data coming back to us that games are a fundamental human interest . '' One could argue Facebook has become a fundamental human interest as well . By the numbers , Facebook has 1.2 billion monthly users . But you already knew that . What you may not have known is that the service also counts 945 million monthly mobile users , and an average of 375 million people play Facebook-connected games a month . A final number : Facebook figures its website and mobile apps send 735 million referrals to games every day . In the words of Morris , Facebook acts as a `` portal into games . '' Facebook has spent the week working to convince developers to go cross-platform , or put their games on mobile and the `` Facebook Canvas , '' a.k.a . the desktop browser . As we reported Monday , Facebook 's own studies have found that cross-platform gamers generate 3.3 times the revenue as those who stick to desktop . Engagement is also higher for those who game on both mobile and desktop as opposed to one or the other . Aaron Brady , games engineering manager at Facebook , said during the roundtable that gaming partners first approached the company about wanting cross-platform play , prompting the internal studies . What did the findings reveal ? `` Yeah , this is big , '' said Brady . The players may be there and they may be paying and engaging on the run and at their desks , but as Morris acknowledged , there is a `` discovery problem looming large over gaming . '' However , while the majority of games may be buried in other app stores , Facebook presents a `` unique opportunity '' for developers to connect with an audience because of its mobile and desktop audiences , Morris reasoned . `` [ We want to ] allow a game developer to deploy a game on to the widest possible audience on the day they launch and find as many people on as many screes as they can , '' Morris said . One way the company is helping users discover games is through improved game requests , announced during GDC . Instead of opaque alerts that do n't tell you anything about what a friend has sent , requests will now contain specific information . `` Tommy sent you a request '' will be replaced with `` Tommy asked you for a life , '' or whatever . This way , gamers can better decide if they want to act upon the request and game developers can see which requests perform and which fall flat . Morris , Brady and Vishu Gupta , head of games engineering at Facebook , each talked about how Facebook helps push games to users , but we wondered about the flip side . Could n't users feel spammed by game recommendations and other forms of game marketing when they just want to check their news feed ? `` We try to think about what 's the right game for this user , '' Gupta offered . `` We invest a lot in figuring out what 's the best game for a user to play . It 's more of a quality question than a quantity question . '' He said the `` number of signals is pretty huge '' when it comes to figuring out what games to recommend to which users . Past playing history and responses to game ads and requests are among the signals Facebook looks at before sending recommendations , Gupta revealed . Facebook seems committed to getting games on both mobile and desktop , not preferring one to the other . Brady noted the company aims for parity between the services and tools it provides game developers for both platforms . The company did n't provide a figure on how many games are available through Facebook at the moment , but Morris noted the company 's game front is `` seeing more success in more genres than before . '' Many of the top titles are mid- to hardcore games , and `` hardcore strategy games '' amount to some of the game network 's most successful . Facebook may have the users and the tools to help developers reach a broad audience , but Morris said the company has one more trick up its sleeve . `` What 's cool about Facebook as a game matching network is it 's friends , '' he said . `` It 's games layered onto of the social graph . It 's what 's exciting about our product . ''

Show most any adult human two different photographs of another person and they 'll be able to match them with nearly 100 % accuracy . These are the kind of results Facebook 's latest research is also zeroing in on . Technology Review reported this week that Facebook has developed new facial verification software capable of matching the same person correctly nearly every time , regardless of whether the subject is actually facing the camera . Using new artificial intelligence technology known as `` deep learning , '' researchers working for the social network have managed to reach a 97.25 % accuracy , even with images where the lightning is different . Those results compare favorably to human beings , who are said to match two different images of the same person with a typical 97.53 % degree of accuracy . `` You normally do n't see that sort of improvement . We closely approach human performance , '' explains Facebook AI team member Yaniv Taigman , noting the latest software has eliminated nearly one quarter of facial matching errors found in earlier versions . DeepFace uses `` facial verification '' software to match two different images where the same face appears , rather than focus on the relatively easier task of only recognizing a person based on their facial characteristics . The new software accomplishes this task in two steps : First by correcting the angle to make the subject face forward , then by applying deep learning from a `` simulated neural network '' to a 3D model until the software is satisfied both images are from the same face . Facebook launched its research group late last year to help increase the accuracy of faces tagged on the social network . One day , we could see this face-spotting tech show up in features such as automatically suggesting tags whenever users upload new photos . Via TechCrunch

`` Cross-platform '' typically carries connotations of jumping from iOS to Android to Windows Phone , but for Facebook 's gaming arm , it has a slightly different meaning . Aaron Brady , an engineering manager at the social network , made the case for game developers to produce titles for both mobile and `` the Facebook Canvas , '' more commonly known as the desktop browser . `` Games are social , and Facebook is social , '' Brady told a room of developers at GDC , adding that the company wants to help devs engage more richly with the people playing their titles . What 's more , just as Facebook is pervasive in 1.2 billion people 's lives , so too can games be anywhere and everywhere while driving revenue for the people who create them . To make his case , Brady cited two studies conducted by Facebook that show cross-platform players `` play more and pay more . '' Certainly music to monetization-minded devs . Chief among the studies ' findings was that revenue from cross-platform players was 3.3 times that of revenue for desktop-only users . Engagement also sees a 40 % increase when mobile is played in tandem with Canvas . Engagement takes an 8 % dip `` with people who stuck to mobile only . '' Facebook told TechRadar that its push for cross-platform game development is based at least in part on the company 's findings that this kind of gaming monetizes well . A spokesperson declined to give specifics on cross-platform usage numbers . We also asked for the most up-to-date figures for mobile game usage , but were told more stats and details are due during a Facebook talk Wednesday . Tune back to TechRadar for all the latest from Facebook and others during the rest of this gaming-filled week !

The US National Security Agency ( NSA ) has denied it operated a botnet of hijacked computers in order to spy on people . `` Recent media reports that allege NSA has infected millions of computers around the world with malware , and that NSA is impersonating U.S. social media or other websites , are inaccurate , '' the NSA said in a statement . `` NSA uses its technical capabilities only to support lawful and appropriate foreign intelligence operations , all of which must be carried out in strict accordance with its authorities . Technical capability must be understood within the legal , policy , and operational context within which the capability must be employed . '' The denial follows leaks made by whistleblower Edward Snowden , which suggest the NSA operated a system called QUANTUMBOT , which searched for compromised networks and took over their command and control centres . These would then allegedly be used to install malware . The agency was also accused of operating a fake Facebook server to install malware and steal documents from users ' computers . NSA news outlet The Intercept cited leaked documents from Snowden for these allegations . The NSA reiterated that it `` does not use its technical capabilities to impersonate U.S. company websites '' or `` target any user of global Internet services without appropriate legal authority . '' It labelled the allegations as `` simply false . '' Via ZDNet

Update : The National Security Agency denied that it impersonated any US company website , which would include Facebook , in order to collect data and spy on targets . Calling such allegations `` inaccurate , '' the intel organization said in a statement March 13 that its technical capabilities are only used for `` lawful and appropriate foreign intelligence operations . '' The memorandum does n't specifically mention Facebook or the Edward Snowden-leaked document . It more generally called it a `` Statement in Response to Press Allegations . '' Original story ... Simply logging into Facebook , or what you thought was Facebook , could have been enough to open your computer up to the National Security Agency 's eavesdropping schemes . The US intelligence organization reportedly masqueraded as a fake Facebook server to infect computers and extract files from a target 's hard drive . The NSA sent malicious data packets to these targets to trick their computers into thinking it was the real Facebook , according to The Intercept citing top secret government documents . These malware `` implants '' are said to have been deployed on anywhere between 85,000 and 100,000 computers and networks , with the intention of infecting millions around the world . While the NSA spearheaded the operating , British counterpart GCHQ reportedly played an integral role in developing these tactics . The idea was reportedly shared with the UK , Canada , New Zealand and Australia . Facebook denied knowledge of this NSA `` man in the middle '' spy program and told The Intercept that this sort of malware attack method is no longer viable . That 's because the social network implemented HTTPS encryption for all users last year after first making it available in 2011 . But when one back door closes , the government looks for another opening . Before Facebook , the same NSA documents reveal that the agency used spam emails that tricked targets with similar results . Clicking on malicious links infected their computers within eight seconds . The only problem was that these unsolicited email methods became less successful . Hence the move to Facebook . It 's clear the NSA sees these programs as invaluable tools that can siphon hard drive data and , in some cases , even record audio from a computer 's microphone or take photos via a webcam . The agency is likely to continue to hack computers and corrupt targeted computers through the next vulnerability it finds .
Facebook has announced it has started rolling out video ads into everyone 's news feed following several months of testing . In a blog post , the social network said 15-second video ads will begin appearing in feeds over the coming months . Luckily , the video advertisements wo n't be a blaring , unavoidable experience . Facebook detailed that the ads will play automatically as they appear on the screen , but they will be without sound and stop once people scroll past . Interested social media browsers can click on the window to expand the video into full screen , sound and all . The ads may be an unwelcome intrusion to some , but Facebook is trying to make them as innocuous as possible . The sponsored vids will run for only a short time and for targeted audiences . Facebook also plans to distance itself from how the ads will be priced . Instead of pricing them directly , an independent third party will set the rates for sponsored slots . The company said it will work with Ace Metrix , a television and video analytics firm , to assess the `` creative quality '' of the ads . Together , they will judge `` creativity '' based on `` watchability , meaningfulness and emotional resonance '' of each promotional clip . Facebook might be slightly off its rocker thinking advertisements can be as good as a Scorsese film , but hopefully this means we will never see a simple infomercial pop up right next to our cat photos .

Facebook has announced plans to resurrect its once-annual F8 conference with a developer-focused event scheduled for April 30 in San Francisco . The company will use the event , the first of its kind since 2011 , to entice mobile software makers to create better mobile apps for the social network . `` This year , we 're going back to our roots and having a pure developer conference , '' Ilya Sukar , the CEO of Facebook-owned Parse , which handles the backend for mobile apps on the platform . `` F8 will open with a morning keynote , followed by four tracks that will cover getting-started guides , technical best practices , infrastructure strategies , engineering deep dives , and advertising tips for making your app or game highly successful . '' Because of the developer-focused nature of the event , it 's unlikely there 's unlikely to be any major announcements concerning Facebook users . The last time the event took place three years ago , Mark Zuckerberg announced the new Timeline user profiles and the ticker . Zuckerberg may or may not appear at the keynote address next month .

Facebook is rolling out redesigned news feed with a very familiar visual refresh . The social network 's updated look for the news feed makes the desktop and mobile versions look the same . As such , all news items are now separated into their own individual boxes with larger images . The redesigned news feed returns the boxed-out look Facebook tried with the complete overhaul from just two days shy of a year ago . Users hated it , almost universally in fact , and now it 's back again . Unlike Facebook 's last go however , the company decided not to rearrange the layout and navigation . So everyone who disliked the way the company moved the chat list to the left-hand side should be glad to hear it 's returned in its proper right-side place . In the same blog post Facebook quantified that the changes are simply visual , writing that it `` do [ es ] not affect how we surface content to people , nor do they change how stories are ranked in news feed . '' `` Though in the new design all images are larger , both organic stories and ads will be the same size - similar to the way images appear on mobile , '' the company continued . The changes are a bit underwhelming , but things have to move slowly when you have more than 1.19 billion users . Meanwhile , Facebook has side loaded its bolder moves to the Creative Labs division , which recently released its first product , Paper . Facebook said it 's rolling out the new news feed design to a majority of members this month .

If you 've been signing in to Flickr with your Facebook or Google account , prepare for all that to change as Yahoo is stripping external log-ins from its services . Starting with Fantasy Sports , the change to the sign-in process will be rolled out gradually across all of Yahoo 's services . This means you 'll have to sign up for a Yahoo account , just as it was back in 2010 when ex-CEO Carol Bartz introduced the competitors ' accounts as a way to get more people using Yahoo 's services . It makes sense for Yahoo to want to 'own ' your account so it can mine your user data to serve ads or , what it calls , `` the best personalised experience . '' Via Reuters

Facebook is said to be in talks to snap up drone manufacturer Titan Aerospace , its first significant play in the Internet.org initiative . Titan Aerospace creates unmanned solar-powered drones capable of flying at 65,000 feet for five years without needing to land , which would offer a cheaper alternative to orbital satellites . Facebook is rumoured to be in negotiations with Titan right now in the hope of using its drones to beam internet connectivity to areas of the world that currently lack access . According to TechCrunch , which learned of the deal , Facebook 's first step will be to have 11,000 drones built with Africa the first country on the list of targets . According to an anonymous source , the deal is going down for $ 60 million although nothing has been verified as of yet . Internet.org is a coalition movement including Facebook , Qualcomm , Samsung , Nokia and others , which plans to bring internet to the 5 billion people of the world who still do n't have means of access . Google , meanwhile , has a similar initiative of its own called Project Loon , which uses balloons instead of satellites or drones . Titan is not currently responding to requests for clarification , but we 'll let you know as soon as we get any sort of official confirmation .

During Facebook 's F8 developer conference , Deb Liu , product marketer for Facebook announced that the new mobile ad network , called the `` Audience Network , '' will be rolling out in the coming months . The Audience Network is a tool for devs that allows Facebook to help with selling and targeting ads , payment and measuring engagement . So far , 60 % of the company 's revenue comes from mobile ads and $ 3 billion ( about £1.7b , AU $ 3.2b ) of Facebook 's transactions come from ads alone . The social network has dabbled with various ad platforms before and tested a newer version of the ad network earlier this year , but it looks like the Audience Network is the final step and is ready for developers , meaning Facebook users will start seeing more ads in their mobile feeds soon . Liu noted that the best way to engage Facebook users involves `` ads that are integrated , not disruptive . '' With Facebook 's `` world class targeting system '' also in play , it 's likely you wo n't see ads that are n't relevant to you . Similar to how Instagram 's photo ads work , Facebook 's system may actually not be too intrusive despite being displayed front and center in the news feed . You can also look forward to the three different types of ad formats showing up on Facebook mobile : banner , interstitial and native . If more ads will just make you angry , at least Facebook is coming out with a new way to login and new mobile functions like the ability to ( finally ) like something on a mobile device .
Facebook had more than a few surprises for the web and mobile during today 's F8 conference held in San Francisco . Three in particular are going to add recognizable Facebook-friendly functionality to many of your favorite apps . The first , called `` send to mobile , '' will allow developers to connect users who frequent the web version of their app to the reciprocal mobile app . That sounds tricky , but hear us out . Say someone goes to Pandora.com to listen to the latest tunes . Once there , they 'll be notified about the availability of Pandora 's mobile app that they may or may not have heard about before . Click the button and a notification will pop up on their phone with a link to the app 's page on the iTunes or Google Play storefront . Viola ! No more scouring the app store for your favorite desktop app on your smartphone 's tiny screen . `` Mobile Like '' is a bit easier to comprehend . In addition to sharing content like you 've done in the past , you 'll now be able to like app content to quickly and easily share your day-to-day activity . Using Flipboard and read something cool ? All you need to do is click the Like button and all your friends will know how passionate you are about whatever it is you 're reading . Unfortunately this technology 's still in beta , but according to Ime Archibong , director of product partnerships at Facebook , you should start seeing mobile-like functionality popping up in your apps over the coming weeks . There 's always been a problem with Facebook 's share function . Sometimes you just do n't want every one of your high school classmates to see how much you dig TaySwift 's new single . But maybe you know another member of the guilty pleasure club and you think they 'd like to give it a listen . All you need to do is click Facebook 's new built-in Messenger tool and you 'll be able to send mobile content directly to your country-loving buddy . It 's interesting technology and should help extend Facebook 's reach in the mobile app sector ... not that they needed it .
At Facebook 's F8 developer conference , the social network has revamped the way users log in to apps with more privacy controls on both the web and mobile devices . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg demoed a completely new anonymous login on stage . Zuckerberg explained this is the login for users who want to try an app and are n't ready to sign in with their real names or share personal information . Whether users are trying to keep their Miley Cyrus fan club rank a secret or feel unsafe about sharing their information with a new app , logging in anonymously lets them try out the app without sharing any personal info . As such , the app wo n't be able to pull data like their birthday or show up as part of their regular Facebook activity . At the same time , anonymous users will be able to use apps as their same incognito selves across devices , including tablets and web browsers . `` This is going to allow you to try apps without fear , '' Zuckerberg said at the F8 keynote . If users so choose to associate themselves with the app afterwards , they can log in with their real identity to further personalize their experience . Alongside the new anonymous login , Zuckerberg also revealed Facebook is improving privacy with the regular account app login . Whereas the login box thus far has only given options to deny or allow an app to post as the user , the new system expands privacy controls into a line-by-line option menu . From this list , users will be able to decide if they want to share their public profile information including likes , friend lists , their email address and birthdays . `` This is going to make people more comfortable signing in to their apps and engaging with them , '' Zuckerberg said . `` This new login is all about giving you more control . '' Beyond giving more control to one user at a time , every user can now limit the way an app pulls data from things shared by people they know , such as photos and friend lists . `` Everyone has to choose to share their own data with an app themselves , '' Zuckerberg explained . All in all these are the privacy controls that users have been clamoring for , which Facebook says will roll out in the coming months . As for all of your older app permissions , Facebook is also tweaking its app control panel to make it easier for users to manage specific permissions or remove apps entirely . This new dashboard will arrive in the coming weeks , according to the social network .

This week 's been all about the numbers : Apple 's sales figures , Facebook 's user numbers and Lytro 's new camera which delivers 1080 x 1080 pixels of light ray goodness . That 's not all : Sony 's released a superb smartphone , Nike 's nixed the Fuelband and details of Windows 9 are beginning to emerge . Here 's what matters this week . It 's time for Apple 's latest results , and while it remains a mind-bogglingly profitable company the news was n't all good : iPad sales have slowed , and we 're still waiting for the exciting new products Tim Cook has been banging on about for ages . More big numbers , this time from Facebook : the social network now has 1.01 billion monthly users on mobile , a 15 % increase over last year , and almost as many people as use Facebook the old-fashioned way . To celebrate , it 's going to stuff your news feed with even more auto-playing video ads . Thanks , Facebook . Thanks a bunch . Here 's a phone with a unique selling point : the OnePlus One phone is the first smartphone to officially run CyanogenMod , the alternative and highly customisable version of Android . It 's `` the most surprising smartphone of the year , '' says John McCann , noting the `` impressive specs , '' `` fluid Android interface '' and `` a price tag which quite simply blows the competition out of the water . '' It 's the end of the road for Nike 's Fuelband , but while the fitness firm is pulling the plug on its fitness band its wearable adventures will continue . With Tim Cook on the board and an Apple wearable imminent , it 's pretty clear what 's going on : as Chris Smith says , Nike would n't leave the fast-growing fitness hardware market `` unless it has bigger plans afoot . '' Plans like leaving the hardware `` to a specialist and a friend like , say , Apple . '' The Sony Xperia Z2 smartphone is here and it 's a beauty : while it does n't boast much in the way of gimmicky features or bold design choices , it 's packed with features , boasts a great screen and has a fantastic camera . We reckon it 's the second-best smartphone money can buy . With just over a month to go , excitement is building over Ubisoft 's next-gen game Watch Dogs - and Lily Prasuethsut reckons it 's entirely justified . Hugh Langley agrees : it 's `` a fascinating look at the terrifying potential of technology '' and more real than you might think . Although Windows 8.1 has addressed some of the criticisms of Microsoft 's OS , Microsoft `` still has a long way to go to produce a unified OS , '' Joe Osborne says . Windows 9 might be what the world is waiting for : with an expected release in 2015 it promises an improved UI , more apps and maybe even gesture control . We 're fascinated by Lytro 's light field technology , which enables you to refocus images after you 've taken the photo , but it 's currently a curiosity rather than a mainstream product . That might change with the Illum , or at least it might when the price comes down : the 40-megaray camera goes on sale in July with a price tag of US $ 1,599 ( about £950 Au $ 1,708 ) .

Virtual reality was n't enough to satisfy Facebook 's ambitions - the social network has just announced that it 's bought fitness-tracking app Moves . Moves logs your daily activites using your smartphone , handily keeping track of when you 've stopped for lunch , work etc . Facebook clearly sees that fitness is the area to get in on right now , and the crew behind Moves are now joining Zuckerberg in the big blue . Update : A Facebook spokesperson has sent TechRadar the following statement about the Moves move : `` As part of Facebook 's multi-app strategy , we 're excited to announce that the popular Moves app will be joining Facebook 's suite of applications . Key members of Moves will be joining Facebook at our headquarters in Menlo Park , Calif . The Moves app will continue to run as a separate , stand-alone application . The Moves team has built an incredible tool for the millions of people who want to better understand their daily fitness activity , and we 're looking forward to the app continuing to gain momentum . '' In a statement , Moves said that it 's moving to Facebook `` to work on building and improving '' products and services `` with a shared mission of supporting simple , efficient tools for more than a billion people . '' We 're told that Moves will contine to operate as a standalone app . As for privacy champions , do n't fear - Moves says that it wo n't `` commingle '' data with Facebook . So that 's Whatsapp , Instagram , Oculus and now Moves . Who 's next ?
Virtual reality is destined to go well beyond gaming , and movies seem the obvious next conquest . According to Cory Ondrejka , Facebook 's VP of mobile engineering , Facebook sees it too . The announcement that Facebook was buying Oculus Rift was a sign that it had wider plans for VR and , speaking during a keynote presentation at this week 's Hollywood IT Summit , Ondrejka said that he sees Oculus Rift expanding into movies . `` I am completely excited about the intersection of Hollywood and virtual reality , '' he said . `` I think what we 're going to see over the next coming year is going to be truly spectacular . '' According to Ondrejka , Imax and CGI-heavy films are ripe for virtual reality . `` The assets that were already produced to make the movie can be re-rendered and can be reused to create new experiences , '' he said . `` I would expect that Imax is going to be one of the killer experiences . '' We 've also learned that Zuckerberg took Sony 's Project Morpheus for a spin a week before purchasing Oculus Rift . PlayStation marketing executive Guy Longworth said during a session at this year 's Games Marketing Summit that he remembers Zuckerberg asking `` Can I have a tech demo ? '' Seems Zuck was sneakily weighing up the competition .

Facebook is plummeting further and further down the ad-driven rabbit hole , and in its most recent earnings call the social network said it wants auto-play video ads to be a common sight in your news feed . Facebook launched video ads in March this year . Some of those video ads - as well as some videos posted by your Facebook friends - play automatically , though the ads are currently muted by default . `` Those are going really well and I think explain some of the growth we 're seeing in our ads business , '' Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said during the company 's first quarter 2014 earnings call . `` We also have been in early conversations with some clients about what would be a CPM [ cost per impression ] auto-play video ad . `` And in terms of the expectations for that , we really want to see auto-play video ads be something that 's pretty common in the news feed experience , based on consumer usage , before we push very hard in the ads business . '' Facebook 's current forays into advertising , like the mobile ad network the company is testing , are admittedly somewhat exploratory . But there can be no doubt that Facebook will `` push very hard '' into advertising soon , and that apparently means users will see even more auto-play ads . `` Video represents a really big opportunity , really driven by consumer behavior . Smartphones are getting better and faster , and more people have phones that can provide a great video experience , '' Sandberg said . She continued , `` There 's also a lot more video going through the feed that consumers are putting in , and that creates an opportunity for us both on the consumer side and on the ad side . '' In a post-call email blast , Facebook referred to its forays into `` premium video ads '' as an area of `` long-term investments and thoughtful roll outs , as we 're focused on the user experience first and foremost . '' It included Instagram ads and the mobile ad network in the same category . Overall Facebook 's revenue from ads grew 82 % year-over-year in the first quarter of 2014 , with a 72 % increase in revenue overall . It was the company 's strongest year-to-year ads growth rate in almost three years . In addition , Facebook reported that 59 % of its ad revenue now comes from mobile users . `` Our goal is to make news feed as engaging as possible , '' Sandberg said on the call . `` I 'm sure your friends love seeing your kids play basketball [ in videos on their news feeds ] . I think they 'd probably like to see more of those . `` And when and if we deliver a really great ad experience , an ad that you love , something you 're interested in , I think they 're going to like that just as much . ''
We knew a lot of people were accessing Facebook through a mobile device , but now the social network has a fresh figure feather to stick in its cap . Slipped in its Q1 2014 quarterly earnings , Facebook revealed the not-so-humble number of 1.01 billion monthly active users as of March 31 , a 34 % increase from this time last year . The figure is ( relatively ) just shy of the 1.28 billion monthly active users hopping on Facebook the old fashioned way . That figure , by the way , is a 15 % increase year-over-year . Facebook as made a huge push to become a mobile first company , and its efforts are clearly paying off . The company is expected to reveal a new mobile ad network during its F8 developer conference next week , and it 's there we 'll likely hear much more about Facebook 's plans for phones and tablets . Do n't expect Facebook to let up on the sector anytime soon ; 59 % of Facebook 's ad revenue comes from mobile , an increase of 29 % from the first quarter last year . Speaking of ads , Facebook saw an 82 % jump in revenue on that front , so ads wo n't diminish either .
Facebook 's takeover of virtual reality firm Oculus appears to have won approval from anti-trust regulators in the United States , or at the very least successfully avoided opposition . The US . Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission had been given 30 days to request more information about the deal , which puts the Oculus Rift in Facebook 's hands , or register disapproval . Facebook had asked the FTC for early clearance , which was granted , meaning there likely wo n't be any more hurdles barring the imminent $ 2 billion ( around £1.19bn , AU $ 2.1bn ) takeover . For consumers , the news effectively kills any lingering hope of a Facebook-free Oculus Rift experience , whether they like it or not . The buyout has so far proved unpopular among the army of Kickstarter backers who kicked in $ 2.4 million ( around £1.43m , AU $ 2.6m ) to to help Oculus reach its funding goal . Some of them demanded their money back . The purchase received a mixed reaction from the gaming community . The creator of Minecraft has nixed a version of the game for the Rift , claiming he finds Facebook `` creepy . '' On the flip side , since the buyout , developers are flocking to pick up the second development kit , perhaps under the impression that Facebook 's vast resources give Oculus a better shot at making the grade . Regardless of all that , there seems to be little to stop Facebook slapping its vision for the future of virtual reality all over Oculus and its promising headset .

Facebook 's long been brewing its very own mobile ad network , and word is the company is about to finally spill the contents of its cauldron . The social network 's plans for mobile ads will be fully revealed at its F8 developer conference in San Francisco at the end of April , according to Re/code , which reportedly spoke with `` multiple sources familiar with the matter . '' Like Google does with its ad network , Facebook will allow developers to use the site 's vast stores of user data to more effectively target users . The Facebook ad network will extend beyond Facebook 's own apps , potentially making other developers happy and Mark Zuckerberg even happier . The social network began testing its mobile ad network in January , when it said it would `` [ work ] directly with a small number of advertisers and publishers , rather than an outside ad-serving platform . '' Facebook struggled with monetizing its own mobile ads initially , but as of the second quarter of 2013 had grown mobile ads to 41 % of all its advertising revenue . During the final quarter of the year Facebook 's mobile ads generated $ 1.24 billion ( about £7.38b , AU $ 1.32b ) . Facebook has been experimenting with its ads more than ever recently , including a partnership with Google , and sponsored Instagram photos , and much-loathed Facebook News Feed video ads .

Facebook has confirmed the data mined through the new Nearby Friends feature may one day be used for advertising and marketing purporses The new tool , which is rolling out to iOS and Android apps in the coming weeks , allows users to share their location with select friends enabling pals to detect when they 're in the locale and arrange meet ups offline . At the time of the announcement on Thursday , Facebook made no mention of sharing the data with advertisers , which would have no doubt coloured the reaction to the feature . Belatedly , a Facebook spokesperson has confirmed to TechCrunch : `` At this time it 's not being used for advertising or marketing , but in the future it will be . '' Facebook is pitching the tool as a valuable new feature for users . It sends occasional notifications informing them how often friends , who 've also agreed to be seen , are in the locale . It will also follow users on their travels , allowing friends to pitch in with suggestions or recommendations wherever they roam around the world .

Those using Facebook Paper on their iPhones are getting a drastically different Facebook experience from everyone else . Today , that experience just got better . Facebook Paper update 1.1 recently hit the App Store , bringing about what Facebook called in a Paper blog post are its most requested features . The update adds birthday and events notifications to Paper , and users with the latest version can scroll past their notifications to see this info . In addition , Facebook Paper users can now leave their own photos as comments on friends ' posts . Facebook Paper 's support for Facebook groups has improved as well , with unread counts so users can see which of their groups have new posts . The update also includes improvements to accessibility support , new indications for unread stories , and reliability and speed improvements overall . Finally , Facebook commissioned designer Sharon Hwang to design new covers for articles from Bloomberg News , Mashable , FT , kottke , Fox News , Popular Science , The Hollywood Reporter , Vanity Fair and Hacker News . Ten weeks after Facebook Paper 's launch , the social network says users read an average of 80 stories every day across five or six different sections , the most popular being Facebook , Headlines , Tech , Ideas , LOL and Pop Life . Facebook says more niche sections like Pride are popular as well . `` Ten weeks have passed since we launched Paper and we want to thank you for being part of our community , '' the Facebook Paper team wrote . `` Our vision is to make Paper the best way to experience stories from friends and the world on Facebook . `` We know we have work ahead of us - and that 's why we appreciate your feedback and support .

Facebook has risked opening up another can of wriggly privacy worms by introducing a new feature which allows users to see which of their pals are nearby . The strictly opt-in Friends Nearby feature will begin rolling out to the firm 's iOS and Android apps in the coming weeks , sending users occasional notifications informing them who is close by or on the move . Facebook says the feature may come in handy for those wishing to meet up with pals when they spot them in the area and help them coordinate for concerts , movies and the like . Those opting in will be able to choose which of their pre-selected friendship groups are able to see their location and will be able to switch Nearby Friends off at any time . The feature , which is similar to the Find My Friends tool in iOS , also works the other way , allowing people to track when their friends are out of town , including which city or neighbourhood they are currently in . Facebook says this could be used to send friends recommendations for restaurants and attractions , and also allow users to arrange a meet up with a friend who 's currently hanging out where they 're heading . Although this feature sure to raise privacy concerns ; in order to see each other 's movements , both friends must have opted in to Nearby Friends and agree to allow the other to see them . In a blog post product manager Andrea Vaccani wrote : `` Sharing your location with Nearby Friends goes two ways - you and your friends both have to turn on Nearby Friends and choose to share with each other to see when you 're nearby . Your friends will only be able to see that you 're nearby if you share this info with them and vice versa . '' Will you be opting into Nearby Friends , or are you a little freaked out ? Let us know your thoughts below .

Facebook Messenger being cleaved off from the full Facebook experience and turned into its own app was only the beginning , according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg . Zucky told The New York Times that his company 's Creative Labs is hard at work `` unbundling the big blue app . '' That means building up standalone apps like WhatsApp and Instagram , but also spinning certain aspects of Facebook out into their own services , just as it 's done with Facebook Messenger . Recall that Creative Labs is the division within Facebook that recently released Facebook Paper , a very different way to view the social network , and is working on other undisclosed experiments . Zuckerberg said people want separate experiences on mobile , as opposed to the single , all-inclusive desktop site and mobile app that Facebook has started out with . For users , a big part of the strategy involves controlling exactly what notifications they receive , Zuckerberg continued . `` I think you 'll see a combination of us making some of these things that have been products for a while into first-class experiences , '' he said . `` And you 'll see us exploring new areas that we felt we did n't have the room to do before . '' Zuckerberg added that `` most '' of the new things Facebook is doing wo n't `` move any needles '' for a long time in terms of Facebook 's overall business . But that does n't mean those things - like Paper , or Facebook Home - will never be successful . They just might take three or five years before they reach Instagram levels of success , he noted .

The sales of Oculus Rift development kits have soared since the firm 's controversial acquisition by Facebook last month . Developers have snapped up 25,000 'DK2 ' units since the second iteration went up for pre-order on March 19 , less than a week before the Facebook buyout was announced . Sales of the DK2 unit have outpaced the original ( which sold 60,000 ) , suggesting that games developers are enthused rather than perturbed by the presence of the new owners . That may be down to the impression that Facebook 's vast resources make Oculus and the Rift 's chances of making it big have greatly improved . The reaction of some potential developers who perhaps see Rift has a more worthwhile platform to build for since Facebook 's intervention is a far cry from the backlash felt in other quarters . Many of the Kickstarter backers who forked over $ 2.4 million ( about £1.4m , AU $ 2.5m ) to help fund the company 's goals demanded their money back following the takeover . Not all developers are ecstatic over Facebook 's presence though . Minecraft creator Markus Persson has given up on plans to bring a VR version of the game to the Rift , claiming Facebook `` creeps me out . '' Via SlashGear
Google has acquired Titan Aerospace , maker of high-altitude , solar-powered drones , for an undisclosed figure . The deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and later confirmed to TechRadar by a Google spokesperson . According to the Journal , Google plans to use Titan 's drones to gather images and connect more of the world 's population to the web . Titan will continue to operate out of its New Mexico base , and Google said the company will work in concert with Project Loon . Google 's Project Loon is working to build massive , high-altitude balloons that beam internet signals to parts of the world still untethered to the net . There 's a chance Titan could also work with Makani , another Google project that 's tinkering with an energy-efficient airborne wind turbine . For its part , Titan has said its drones , which are designed to fly for up to five years , can gather real-time , high-res images of the earth , tow atmospheric sensors and bolster voice and data services . Titan claims its Solara drones can shoot internet signals at speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second . It 's currently developing two drones of different sizes powered by solar-charging batteries . The smaller model has a wingspan a scosche larger than that of a Boeing 767 . `` Initial commercial operations '' of Titan 's drones are expected to take off next year . In a statement , the Google spokesperson told us : `` Titan Aerospace and Google share a profound optimism about the potential for technology to improve the world . It 's still early days , but atmospheric satellites could help bring internet access to millions of people , and help solve other problems , including disaster relief and environmental damage like deforestation . It 's why we 're so excited to welcome Titan Aerospace to the Google family . '' If the mission sounds familiar , one need look no further than Facebook , Internet.org and its own drone ambitions . Facebook was reportedly in talk to buy Titan earlier this year , but opted instead to `` acqhire '' UK-based aerospace firm Ascenta . The Facebook Connectivity Lab is working on an airborne Internet.org initiative , developing drones , satellites and lasers to deliver `` affordable access to basic internet services available to every person in the world . '' Both companies ' goals are altruistic enough , but there 's definitely a race to be the first internet delivery boy for billions of people going on between them . Android has taken the mobile world by storm and is found in innumerable feature phones , but Facebook has countered with its own communications maneuvers , including its recent purchase of WhatsApp . The battle for communications supremacy has clearly gone airborne , and we can just picture Amazon plotting its next drone move as well .
Facebook could be badgering you to send your friends money in the next few weeks as rumour has it that the social network is planning to launch a Paypal-like service . The Financial Times reports that the company is `` weeks '' away from getting the go-ahead from the authorities in Ireland to allow it to hold money and send it between Facebookers . The paper also says that three British firms that run money transfer apps have been in talks with the 'Book , suggesting it 's going after mobile payments too . All of this points to a possible European money transfer service , but whether it will extend to the US and beyond is another story . Would you trust Facebook with your money ? Let us know in the comments below .
In a few short years the face of television has changed . No longer are broadcasters in charge of what and where you watch : now you are . The meteoric rise of on demand and watch anywhere programming took much of the television industry by surprise ; it meant its usual glacial pace was thwarted and big changes had to be made . Some broadcasters moved faster than others . The BBC showed that with iPlayer , there was still a reason for its being in a world that was no longer shackled by schedules . But when it was released in 2007 , it was a service that was used mainly by the computer literate and not the average BBC user who tunes into EastEnders . When Anthony Rose joined the BBC he decided to turn this around by making the software available to all . And seven years later he is making the same move again , but with his current company Zeebox . This week , Rose announced that Zeebox is changing its name to Beamly . This brand revamp is the culmination of months of work , with Zeebox changing from a utility app - where the idea of its users was modelled more on him and his band of devs - into what Rose wants to be `` the social network for TV '' . `` Zeebox was all about the television and now Beamly is about the TV show . '' `` What we have seen over the last six months is that once upon a time , Zeebox was all about the television and now it is about the TV show , '' said Rose to TechRadar . `` It used to be about the utility of controlling your television , your tags and syncing with shows . But now more and more people are watching on-demand , with shows like House of Cards . `` We love people that like the utility [ side of the app ] but the problem is they do n't tell their friends . But people who chat in TV rooms speak to their friends and that 's when you get a social network . '' As with his transformation of the iPlayer , making changes to appeal to the masses is nothing new to Rose . Taking that technology , simplifying it and putting the shows on that the general TV population was watching was key to the massive success of the platform , as much as , say , iPlayer 's arrival on mobile devices . With Zeebox , Rose and his team looked at the how and when people were using the app - they could clearly see that when changes that showed off the social side were made , use of the app exploded . `` When we started the company , we were super served internally with male geeky guys , essentially people like myself . And this meant we automatically leaned to engineering the utility side of Zeebox , '' said Rose . But there was a problem : it turns out those `` geeky guys '' that were originally targeted do n't actually watch television that much . `` So we started advertising for colleagues that love shows such as Made in Chelsea and EastEnders . They came into the office and told how they watch these shows and it became clear that the biggest group of 'social watchers ' were the ones that watched the X Factors and the Big Brothers of the world . `` For them , the remote aspect of the app was n't what they wanted , but more a fix of updates about their favourite shows that they could read over lunch . '' Once Rose and his team began tweaking the app towards that , they saw things take off in a big way - it turns out that those who use the social side of the app were staying on Zeebox for 10 times longer than those who just used the tech tools that it is also known for , such as tagging , show syncing and remote functionality . Unsurprisingly , the tonal shift of the app meant that the audience was changing too . `` 65 % of Zeebox users are now female , since this shift six months ago - particularly in the US . We are resonating with the same sort of audience that Pinterest has , where it is women at home , extremely social that want to talk about shows twenty four seven , '' said Rose . The fruits of this change can now be seen in Zeebox 's rebranding to Beamly . A softer coral colour scheme - and , dare we say it , a more iPlayer-like look - has been used and the social aspects of Zeebox that were out of sight before are now front and centre . The geekiness of Zeebox that was at odds with the social side of the app has seemingly vanished . `` The homepage has become your feed home , which houses not just what you are posting but what your friends are too . We are hoping that this homepage becomes the social network for TV , '' explains Rose . `` The design looks very clean . It was bit like renovating a home . Zeebox had become a mismatch of styles and we wanted to give everything a new style . '' Interestingly the utility side of the app is still there but Rose has pitch shifted this to the sidelines to make way for what he hopes will be another social network that the world flocks to . `` With Facebook , people do n't want to talk about TV with their friends , they want to talk about it with fans of the show . '' Beamly comes at an interesting time for TV and social networks . Both Facebook and Twitter are looking into utilising television but neither have yet succeeded . This is n't for want of trying as these social giants are gearing up for a data turf war with each other , giving television broadcasters information about how who comments on their shows . Facebook is doing this in partnership with SecondSync , offering anonymised data of its 1.23 billion users ' TV habits - while Twitter has a deal with Nielsen in place . Data mining only works if you have the right information , though , and Rose believes you can only get this somewhere like Beamly . `` What is interesting is that Facebook and Twitter have very different follow models : Facebook is traditionally people you went to school with and Twitter is the broadcast model , '' notes Rose . `` With Facebook , people do n't want to talk about TV with their friends , they want to talk about it with fans of the show - because your friends have completely different viewing tastes . `` With Twitter , most do n't want to mix your professional life with talking trash around something like Hollyoaks . So , how do you keep that separate ? '' Rose believes the solution is an updated , better-looking forum scenario that can be found in Beamly . `` Our TV rooms are resonating because of this . They are vibrant , especially with the new style and brand . `` As for analytics , for major broadcasters we provide publishing tools that will help change television in the future . This is boring for the consumer but will be essential for broadcasters and advertisers . '' Changing television in the future is something that is key to Rose . Having already been part of the success of iPlayer , as well as an integral part of YouView , there is no better person placed to understand the machinations of the broadcast industry : the reasons there are struggles to innovate when it seems so obvious to us consumers that television should be delivered to us how we want it , when we want it . This is something Rose wants to see too and firmly believes that Beamly has been created to be part of the TV model that we will all eventually use . `` Second screen apps are slightly ahead of the curve and television has n't changed as fast as app manufacturers innovated , '' he said . `` I see this in ourselves where we have dialled down some of the app . We always wanted to be the social network for TV but when we got started we were faced with broadcast television , not TV anywhere . `` There is no doubt in anyone 's mind that we will be watching television in a vastly different way in five-to-10 years . TV watching will be where and when we want on any device and we will be speaking to our friends and interact with the shows we watch . `` Beamly has to resonate with that and offer what people want .

Facebook is on the hunt for spam and has introduced three measures to combat the irrelevant content that clogs many users ' news feeds . The first targets what Facebook calls `` like-baiting , '' or posts that straight-up ask news feed browsers to like , comment or share a post in order to circulate it more widely than it would normally reach . Call-to-actions typically work , thus thrusting like-baiting posts to the top of the news feed spotlight . However , that does n't change their spam status , and users reportedly find these types of stories 15 % less relevant than other posts with a similar number of likes , comments and shares . Facebook 's like-baiting solution will supposedly better detect these stories and keep them from appearing in prominent places on the news feed . Pages `` genuinely trying to encourage discussion among their fans '' wo n't be affected , and the initial implementation will focus on Pages that frequently ask for likes , comments and shares . The second area Facebook is looking to improve is frequently circulated content , or photos and videos that are posted ad naseum . Repetition does n't always equate to relevancy , so in that vein Facebook is moving to de-emphasize the Pages that frequently post the same photos and videos . Finally , Facebook has set its sights on spammy links in misleading posts , such as those that claim to contain a photo album but really take clickers to a website full of ads . Facebook 's method to address the problem is pretty nuanced ; it 's figured out how to detect spammy links by measuring how frequently people visiting a link choose to like the original post or share it . This is n't the first time Facebook has tinkered with its news feed algorithm , and it certainly wo n't be the last . Hopefully with today 's changes , we see more like/comment/share-worthy posts and less spam stream through our feeds .

Facebook has begun alerting some users that it will soon force them to use the company 's standalone Messenger app if they want to chat on mobile . The move is n't an isolated trial run . `` Today we are starting to notify people that messages are moving out of the Facebook app and over to the Messenger app , '' a Facebook spokesperson wrote in an email to TechRadar . `` To continue sending messages on mobile , people will need to install the Messenger app . '' Referred to as an `` update , '' the change will affect those with an iOS or Android device . Currently , users in a handful of European countries are being notified of the switch , and Facebook declined to offer details on a further roll out . However , according to TechCrunch , all Facebook mobile users will eventually be forced to move to Messenger . European users receiving notifications reportedly have about two weeks before they can no longer chat within mobile Facebook 's apps . Facebook 's mobile offerings have , for as long as we can remember , included a integrated tab to chit-chat with friends . However , Facebook recently made it so those who had the Messenger app installed were shuttled there when they hit the inner-app messaging tab . Even so , users did n't have to download Messenger if they wanted to . That choice is now being taken out of their hands , though with Facebook 's vagueness we do n't know when it will reach all users ( if at all ) . Although the move is sure to anger some , it should n't come as a surprise . CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in November 2013 Facebook was planning to take messaging out of the main Facebook app . Zuckerberg went on to lay out the central reason given today by Facebook 's spokespeople ; the company can now focus on making Messenger as good a service as possible without having to deal with two separate messaging experiences . Users will receive multiple notices before the changes go into effect , Facebook informed us .
Like most Facebook users you 've probably learned to ignore whatever is in the site 's right-hand column . You know , the space with usually creepy ads targeted at random snippets from your profile or Google searches . But Facebook is hoping users will start paying attention again when it revamps those ads to be bigger . Facebook says the new ads will be more in line with the ads that now appear in users ' news feeds , with larger images . At least there will be fewer of them now , the site said . `` For advertisers , this offers a simpler way to create ads and an enhanced creative canvas on the right-hand column of Facebook , '' the social network wrote in a blog post . It continues , `` Because the updated ads mirror the overall shape of desktop News Feed ads , marketers will no longer have to choose separate images for News Feed and right-hand column placements . '' Facebook also says the new ads will provide `` a better experience for people . '' Apparently early tests have shown up to three times as much engagement with the larger ads , though whether that 's really better for people - or just for advertisers - is a subjective matter . The new Facebook ads will roll out to users `` in the coming months . '' Some advertisers will get the option in April , while others will need to wait until later in 2014 .

Facebook is once again seeking to cleanse its mucky reputation when it comes to privacy , this time by furnishing the world with new information regarding how it looks after user content and data . In a briefing with reporters , the social network said it runs a rather sizeable 80 trillion checks every day to ensure any data is n't being wrongly exposed to the world . The firm also said it conducts 4,000 surveys a day ( in 27 languages , no less ) directly relating to privacy . Among other things , those results prompted it to start showing on-screen explanations for privacy controls . Facebook now plans on introducing a host of more explanations , which it hopes will lessen the confusion and misconceptions experienced by users when the company changes tact , as it often has in recent times . Users will be informed they can change the visibility of old cover photos and it will also offer clarification that when a friend shares content it will only be visible to the person 's mutual friends . The company also plans to introduce an in-line box to explain the differences between public status updates and those meant only for friends . As well as word of the privacy checks and surveys , Facebook also revealed the logistics behind its privacy efforts . Responsibilities are split into two teams : the Privacy Product Engineering squad , which builds the consumer-facing settings ; and the Privacy Infrastructure Engineering team which works to ensure any unassigned data is locked down . So , according to Facebook , it does work really , really hard when it comes to protecting its members from the accidental over-sharing of content , despite their desire to have users share with 'everybody .

A new report by Greenpeace USA has found that Apple , Facebook and Google are among the greenest technology companies and are driving a major shift towards the use of renewable energy within the industry . The report suggests that Amazon could be doing much more to source clean energy . Clicking Clean : How Companies are Creating the Green Internet considers the power that tech companies have in driving the uptake of renewable energies . It looks at the energy choices that have been made by 19 major Internet companies and examines their electricity supply chains of more than 300 data centers . Among the best performers , the report notes that Apple uses 100 % renewable energy to power its iCloud service and also operates the largest privately owned solar installation in the US . Apple has previously been praised by Greenpeace for improving its clean energy efforts . The report also notes that Apple , Facebook and Google have all influenced energy providers to produce more clean energy and have clear green electricity policies in place . The report states , meanwhile , that only 15 % of electricity used by Amazon Web Services is sourced from clean means and that the services growth is , `` fueling the increased use and construction of coal and gas-burning power plants . '' Amazon Web Services is flagged up in particular due to it being used to power a large number of sites across the web , including Pinterest , Netflix , Spotify , Tumblr , AirBnB , Yelp and Vine . Twitter is also cited as lacking transparency about its energy footprint and failing to source clean electricity . `` Apple , Facebook and Google are powering our online lives with clean energy , and building a greener offline world for everyone in the process , '' said Gary Cook , a senior IT analyst at Greenpeace . `` These companies have proven over the past 24 months that wind and solar energy are ready and waiting to power the internet , and the rest of our economy , with clean electricity . '' The report calls on major Web companies to commit to using become 100 % renewably-sourced powered , provide transparency about their energy footprints and develop strategies for increasing their supply of renewable energy .

Facebook is changing everyone 's News Feed to feature fewer auto-shared posts , including what Spotify songs their friends are listening to and images they like on Instagram . In a move to reduce auto-shared spam , the social network promises users ' third party apps will post fewer stories on their behalf . Additionally , apps that auto-share your activity , such as Socialcam and Viddy , will need to prompt users with an option to opt out before apps can post the video to their timelines . However , Facebook is n't doing away with sharing from third-party apps completely . In a developer update , the social network wrote it 's prioritizing explicitly shared stories over automated posts . By doing so , Facebook users should feel less confused by activity that shows up seemingly on its own . Meanwhile , everyone can breathe a sigh of relief knowing their News Feeds wo n't be flooded with `` implicitly '' shared posts all the time . Automated sharing helped build Facebook into an aggregator that allowed users to post practically everything they saw and did online . However , in the last year the company has been trying to reinvent itself as a more mature and conscientious social network with revised privacy controls . By combing down the News Feed to promote explicitly shared content , Facebook wants to pull only the most interesting and personal stories from the web . `` In general , we 've found that people engage more with stories that are shared explicitly rather than implicitly , and often feel surprised or confused by stories that are shared implicitly or automatically , '' Facebook 's Peter Yang said in a blog post . While auto-sharing helped Facebook grow as the internet 's boombox , it 's actually hurt the thumbs-up firm ; Yang wrote that the number of implicitly shared stories has declined as people have come to associate these posts with spam .

Did you know that everything you 've ever posted to Facebook with the default sharing options has been public for the whole internet to see ? It 's also been just as easy to change your broadcasting choice to `` friends only '' with a few clicks , but now Facebook is changing the default share settings to friends only for new users . In a blog post , the social network wrote the change is being implemented for all new users going forward . Additionally , Facebook will prompt first-time posters with a message to make sure they know who their activity is being shared with . Even if users somehow accidentally make their posts public repeatedly , Facebook will send a reminder to confirm they are sharing their activity with the audience they want . Older users are n't being left out of Facebook 's new privacy-conscientious measures . For people already on Facebook , the firm will roll out a new and expanded privacy check-up tool over the next few weeks . Like the prompt new users receive , the feature will take users through a review process of their privacy settings . This includes how private user updates are , which apps they use , and who can see their profile information . Over on mobile devices , status updates will be clearly marked with audience selectors above where users type to make sure they know who will see their posts . After a long sting of questionable user privacy practices it seems Facebook is trying to turn a new leaf in the privacy realm . Facebook 's developer conference last month , the company introduced anonymous app login along with a redesigned app control panel to easily tweak privacy permissions .

Since its inception , Facebook has slowly been putting together a digital identity from everything you like and do , down to your real-life movements . Now the social network has launched a new service that listens , too . Facebook updated its iOS and Android apps with a new tool that can identify songs and television shows . Similar to Shazam , this new audio recognition feature will identify almost anything your listening to , making it easy to post in a status update . Friends seeing any posted songs will be able click on your shared activity for a quick 30-second preview of the tune . The feature also works with TV shows , including live TV and sporting events . Unlike songs , there wo n't be any embedded media in the News Feed , but you can discuss Game of Thrones spoilers with your friends . The update is gradually coming to mobile apps over the coming weeks to app users in the US . Facebook has yet to release a timetable for when the update will arrive for all . The new listening feature is off by default so the Facebook app wo n't ever listen in without the user knowing . Once users manually turn it on , the feature is one tap away with the smiley face icon on the status update window . As a new part of Facebook 's `` Feelings '' options , the feature is just another way for users to skip typing and make the News Feed a media rich experience . Facebook has a crummy privacy track record and history may be repeating itself again here . Mashable alleged that the Facebook app listens in whenever users goes to the compose page , identifying songs or shows . Supposedly even if the user choses not to publish the information , it 's still logged into Facebook 's database . Then there 's the question of what else Facebook might be listening in on . To help dissuade spying fears , the Facebook app prompts users with a message before turning on the listening tool that reads , `` We ca n't identify background noise and conversation . Sounds are only used to find a match and are never stored . ''

Facebook has responded to its failed attempt to buy picture messaging service Snapchat by creating its own rival named 'Slingshot ' , it 's been reported . According to the Financial Times , Facebook began building Slingshot immediately after Snapchat rejected Zuckerberg 's $ 3 billion acquisition offer , and the app could be released as soon as this month . Sources told the FT that the new app will have a simple UI and restrict interaction down to a minimum to make creation and delivery of videos as simple as possible . Facebook has been losing ground to Snapchat in the last two years as teens flock in their droves to the self-destructing picture messaging service . Since its inception , Snapchat has sent over 400 million messages . Slingshot is n't Facebook 's first try at a Snapchat-like service . In late 2012 it released 'Poke ' , which allowed users to take and send short video and picture messages . Its unpopularity saw it removed from the iOS App Store in May this year . Facebook 's need to stay relevant in the face of stiff competition has seen it purchase Instagram , WhatsApp and attempt to buy Snapchat . In all cases , eye watering amounts of money have been thrown around . Facebook declined to comment on this story .

Updated : Users of the Moves app were concerned when the privacy policy was updated to add that it would , after all , share information with Facebook . But it was n't very specific about what data would be passed over to the social network . However , Facebook has confirmed that the sharing wo n't be as sinister as some of you may have assumed . Your data will merely be sent to Facebook staffers so they can `` actually work on building the app '' . But that 's where it 'll end . Facebook said it has no plans to carry over any of your Moves data to your Facebook account - so nothing will be used for adverstising purposes . Original story below ... When Facebook announced that it was buying Moves earlier this year , privacy pundits we aghast at the idea of the social network devouring all your biometric fitness data gathered by the tracker . But the two companies promised not to `` commingle '' data and that Moves would continue to operate as a stand-alone app . Now , however , Moves ' user agreement has been updated and speaks of sharing information `` including personally identifying information '' with its affiliated companies - `` including but not limited to Facebook . '' The company says that sharing your data will `` help provide , understand and improve our services '' but it makes no mention of what 's in it for Facebook or what it could be getting up to with the knowledge of when you 're running , walking , biking , driving or sitting still . It seems likely that Facebook would use knowledge of your motions to provide more targeted advertising in your news feed . And if you do n't like it , you 'll have to stop using Moves . Via Engadget

A large group of internet companies , led by some of the biggest names in the business , have taken a stand against new net neutrality rules put forth by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler . Amazon , Google , Facebook , Microsoft , Netflix , Twitter and Yahoo are just some of the cosigners on a short yet sharp letter ( PDF ) to the FCC . `` According to recent news reports , '' the letter states , `` the Commission intends to propose rules that would enable phone and cable internet service providers to discriminate both technically and financially against internet companies and to impose new tolls on them . If these reports are correct , this represents a grave threat to the internet . '' The companies note that instead of `` permitting bargaining and discrimination , '' the FCC 's edicts `` should protect users and internet companies ... against blocking , discrimination and paid prioritization , and should make the market for internet services more transparent . '' The internet companies ' furor comes amidst public outcry against proposed rules that would open internet `` fast lanes '' for firms willing to pay . Those who are n't would invariably be stuck in internet slow lanes . While FCC Chairman Wheeler has maintained he 's on the side of an equal and open internet , even fellow Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said there are `` real concerns '' with his net neutrality proposals and wants to delay the commission 's `` consideration '' of them by at least a month . The rules are set for a vote May 15 , and a Sunshine Period by which the FCC can accept public comment ends tomorrow . Due to the `` torrent of public response '' the proposed rules have elicited , Rosenworcel states more time is needed to collect and consider public input . As of this writing , the FCC 's vote is still scheduled for May 15 . Via Engadget

Fancy playing a massively multiplayer online game with a billion other people ? That could be what we ultimately see as a result of Facebook 's $ 2 billion purchase of Oculus VR . While Facebook and Oculus VR have kept quiet about their goals following the acquisition , Oculus VR CEO Brendan Iribe has revealed the potential for an ambitious project while talking to an audience at TechCrunch Disrupt , saying : `` This is going to be an MMO where we want to put a billion people in VR . '' It would certainly be an interesting way to engage Facebook 's enormous user base , with the social network acting as a meta-verse joining disparate virtual worlds . Sadly we wo n't be seeing it any time soon , with Iribe admitting the project will `` take a bigger network than exists in the world today . '' There is still plenty for Oculus VR to do before that network does arrive , with Iribe revealing the company is aiming to convince players that they are having a `` real conversation '' with another person . While it 's difficult to generate believable , photorealistic human faces in video games , Iribe believes this obstacle can be overcome if players are willing to `` let go . '' Iribe 's comments reveal some of the thinking behind the sale of Oculus VR to Facebook , rather than one of the big gaming companies . While a gaming giant may have seemed a more obvious choice , Iribe asked his audience , `` Do you want to build a platform that has a billion users on it , or only 10 , 20 , or 50 million ? ''

Facebook has moved to deny reports it has all-but-abandoned the much-lauded Facebook Home suite for Android smartphones . A New York Times report said the social network had 'disbanded ' the team of engineers responsible for building the custom skin , which allows users easier access to status updates , photos , messages and more . The software , which effectively turns Android devices into a 'Facebook phone , ' has experienced little success among users and virtually no critical acclaim since its high profile launch event back in April 2013 . The NYT said members of the team have now been moved to other projects like the new , Snapchat-a-like Facebook Slingshot app , while Facebook Home features like Chat Heads have gravitated to the main app . However , following the report , Facebook told The Verge claiming that work on Home , remains ongoing , despite the absence of any sort of update since January . All-in-all though , Facebook seems much more focused on pushing its standalone applications and services , rather than turning handsets into Facebook-only phones . Instagram is now firmly in the Facebook camp , WhatsApp is now under its wing , Facebook Messenger is being pushed heavily , while Slingshot also recently joined the fray . With regards to Facebook Home . Well , if a tree falls in the woods and no-one is around to hear it , does it really make a sound ?

A Facebook News Feed packed with negative status updates from peers is more likely to spur individual users to follow suit , a new study carried out by the social network has shown . The company 's experiment artificially tweaked the feeds of 689,003 users to show more downcast or more positive updates from their friends over the course of one week . The results , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science showed a direct correlation between the emotions conveyed in the users ' own posts over that period of time . While it 's unsurprising that something sad or happy happening to a large number of close friends and acquaintances can affect our emotions , the study does offer a modicum of proof social media is affecting the mood of users , for better our worse . The authors wrote : `` In an experiment with people who use Facebook , we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed . When positive expressions were reduced , people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts ; when negative expressions were reduced , the opposite pattern occurred . '' While the study yields perhaps unsurprising results , it 's somewhat unsettling that Facebook is turning users into guinea pigs for psychological experiments without proper consent . Naturally , as Gizmodo points out , the machine-based testing is all covered under Facebook 's privacy policy . `` We show , via a massive ( N = 689,003 ) experiment on Facebook , that emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion , leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness , '' the study claimed . Lovely .

Search engines , social media and text messages are history . The major 'walled gardens ' of the the internet are developing fast , but all of the big four are betting on various visions of the future . Will the next big things be home automation , virtual reality social networking … or something else entirely ? With two-thirds of the world 's population not yet online , what happens next to the internet is truly up for grabs . `` Google is thinking of mobile in a much broader manner , '' says Aaron Goldman , CMO of Kenshoo , and author of Everything I Know About Marketing I Learned From Google . `` It 's not just about phones and tablets . It 's about devices in your home , such as Nest , in your car – such as Waze and Android OS in navigational systems – as well as on your face with Google Glass . '' Last year everyone was obsessed with Google Glass before a collective fear of a loss of privacy took hold . The smart glass now seems destined for a life as a speciality product used as a rather boring work tool , though that has n't stopped a Google Glass 2 going into development . Will it run on Android Wear ? Although Google will release its own smart watch , the master plan behind Android Wear is creating this new operating system , complete with built-in access to Google Now contextual features and voice commands , Google search , and probably Gmail , too . With products due from HTC , Samsung , Asus , Motorola and LG , Android Wear could be a way-in to the future of how we all interact with gadgets . You should also expect a layer of cloud-powered sporty goodness called Google Fit , an app that will provide those all-important stats on steps , heart rate and calories that we all simply must have access to . Or not . Yes , the internet of things is here and Google wants to be part of it . Whether your home and your car run on Android , iOS or something else is a decision that looms in all of our futures . Google 's acquisition of Nest and its smart thermostat and smoke alarm products is more a signal of intent that a concept in its own right . Its Android @ Home initiative is likely to expand into Google Home , or something similar , that creates a smart dashboard for homes . As an app , obviously . Google is covering all of the bases here ; it 's also interested in robotics and artificial intelligence . Google has big money and big plans , and some of them are probably nonsense . There 's a reason Google X , is called the 'moonshot factory ' . On the sensible side comes a Google Maps upgrade : just this month it acquired Skybox Imaging , the company responsible for Google Maps ' images , and Google have also opened talks with Virgin Galactic about getting mapping satellites into orbit . As well as improving Google Maps – something its acquisition of social mapping app Waze is now doing – it could also become part of Google 's drive to increase internet access in rural and remote areas of the globe . So far those ambitions come under Project Loon , a bizarre concept to put a network of Wi-Fi balloons at the edge of space to help fill coverage gaps , and bring people back online after disasters . However , with its purchase of solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace it could possibly get off the ground . Other projects to come out of Google X include Calico which focuses on tackling ageing and illness with technology , and a patent application for smart contact lenses with camera sensors embedded inside . It may have tried and failed with its Facebook Home OS layer for Android phones , but there are precious few products and service that Facebook does n't want to offer its 1.28 billion monthly users . By adding voice WhatsApp could be huge across the globe . `` It will disrupt mobile telephony like Skype did . By integrating a platform like WhatsApp into Facebook , the new owners have a real deep-reach into the day-to-day communications of users , '' says entrepreneur and strategist Vikas Shah , President , TiE Manchester . `` WhatsApp was one of the few 'off platform ' ways people did this , and that 's important . '' Facebook is also creating its own version of SnapChat called Slingshot , which could become a valuable mobile business tool . Facebook is also thinking about the next major computing platform . Why else would it have bought virtual reality headset maker Oculus Rift ? `` Unlike mobile , which was not seen as core to the Facebook story , virtual reality is set to be central to its ambitions , '' says Dave Wallace , CEO of digital agency Heath Wallace . `` Imagine being able to step inside a social space , with a virtual representation of yourself , and going to meet others – it certainly has appeal , '' he says . Banking is also in Facebook 's future , with the money transfer market rumoured to be on the company 's to-do list . `` Going after the money transfer market could help Facebook gain access to payment information on a huge number of users while also extending the network 's presence in emerging markets , '' says Patrick Salyer , CEO of social media infrastructure company Gigya . However , he points out that to succeed Facebook will need to find a unique model that differentiates from money transfer providers like PayPal or Western Union . Money transfers are a way of getting people locked-in to Facebook on smartphones , but what if there 's no phone signal ? Cue the Connectivity Lab . `` In most countries Facebook is the internet , '' says Lorry Destainville , Head of Product Development at Glow . `` If users are far from phone relays , Facebook may deploy internet network via drones , so that these users want to start accessing the web . '' File next to Google 's Project Loon . Amazon is no longer just a place to buy books . Its brazen attempt to get people to pay a monthly Amazon Prime fee to use its services seems to have worked ( thanks in part to Amazon Prime Instant Video ) , and we 're on the cusp of Amazon being integral to some people 's daily lives and habits . It cleared-up in the e-books market with its Kindle , but there 's much more emphasis on the Amazon ecosystem in its follow-up Kindle Fire tablets . It 's no surprise that Amazon is putting more of its hardware into the market ; for now we 've got Amazon Fire TV , Amazon Prime Instant Video and – soon – Amazon Prime Music , but what comes next ? Here comes Amazon 's 'missing link ' , the 4.7-inch Fire Phone that 's all about tying-in owners to Amazon services . The Amazon Appstore now hosts 240,000 apps and games available in almost 200 countries , and its first handset will boast a glasses-free 3D screen . That novelty might wake-up the dozing smartphone market , but this is about Amazon popularising its locked-in platform while also breaking free from its website-only retail model . The Fire Phone is a gateway to Amazon 's digital content library , with the likes of the Kindle Store , Audible , Kindle Newsstand and its newly acquired Comixology service embedded . It 's all about popularising Prime ; members will get unlimited streaming access to music , movies and TV . Having taken a chunk of business from high street shops , Amazon now wants to put the postman out of work , too . An air delivery system that would deliver orders in just 30 minutes , Prime Air is a fleet of autonomous octocopters that can deliver 86 per cent of Amazon deliveries – as long as there 's a warehouse 10 miles away . Amazon 's Jeff Bezos has plans to go even higher ; his Blue Origins private spaceflight company has its own hydrogen-fuelled rockets and has ambitions to lower the cost of spaceflight . It could begin to make suborbital flights in 2018 , both for space tourists and astronauts visiting the International Space Station . It 's hard to know exactly what Apple thinks will be the next big thing since it is so massively secretive . But with its trend-setter position gone , Apple is quickly becoming a follower , with its iPhone 5S & 5C split and Apple 's acquisition of Beats the evidence . Apple 's OS X 10.10 Yosemite announcement is small-fry in the world of the Big Four , but the updates to iOS8 and especially iCloud Drive should allow Apple to catch-up with rivals Dropbox and Google Drive . As well as allowing 5GB email attachments called MailDrop , the storage available will be much larger than the current tiny limits . November saw Apple acquire PrimeSense , an Israeli company whose motion tech was used in the first version of Microsoft 's Xbox Kinect . Is this for Apple iTV , the iWatch or a future iteration of the iPhone ?

Facebook is massive and it 's growing fast . The social network has seen a steady rise in mobile use , with active users doubling from roughly 500 million in early 2012 to nearly a billion this year . Key to the social network 's growth is its piggy backing on the spike in mobile web access - as the world moves away from computers to phones , Facebook is taking advantage with the hope that it can emulate Google 's success in mobile form . This begs the question : can anyone - including Google - stop the Facebook juggernaut from taking over the internet ? `` The internet is very clearly going to become mobile-first , and Facebook is well placed to be a big part of this phase of the internet , '' says Mark Holden , Head of Futures at Arena . `` Facebook estimates that 20 % of user time spent on mobile is on Facebook - and once you factor in their ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp , which are mobile-first platforms , it will clearly be a dominant force in our daily lives across social networking , imaging , messaging and eventually VOIP too . '' Currently , Facebook is in an aggressive acquisition stage as it seeks to build a constellation of must-have apps . It 's clear that buying up popular apps such as WhatsApp is a key part in Facebook 's plan to take control of the mobile web . Jason Mander , GlobalWebIndex 's Head of Trends explained to TechRadar : `` Looking at WhatsApp 's user base shows why the acquisition was such a smart move . Fast-growth nations dominate the list of countries with the highest usage levels , with the figure hitting 50 % + of the online populations in Hong Kong , South Africa , Malaysia and Singapore . '' The acquisition of WhatsApp has given Facebook two major advantages , believes Brian Taylor , Digital MD at Jaywing . `` It 's removed a serious competitor threat , '' he explained . `` Where Facebook owns 'capturing our moments ' , WhatsApp dominates one-on-one communication , particularly in emerging markets across Asia . '' It 's also about access to real-time data . `` WhatsApp allows Facebook to see huge amounts of demographic and behavioural data as it happens , '' says Taylor . `` While monetisation is not stated as a priority at present , the move will undoubtedly unlock huge amounts of insight Facebook can offer to advertisers at a later stage . '' Facebook has a natural advantage over Google since it 's based on real people , not the anonymous cookies Google relies on . `` Most advertising networks know very little about their users , making it very difficult for them to place effective ad units , '' notes Lorry Destainville , Head of Product Development at Glow Digital Media ( Glow ) and a global provider of Facebook technology solutions . `` This is where Facebook excels - by using its knowledge of user identity , it has fundamentally redefined ad targeting , enabling relevant ads to be delivered to users as they scroll uninterrupted through their newsfeed . '' Another thing that has to be factored in is that if you deal with Facebook , you deal with huge numbers . `` Facebook 's a platform with over 1.28 billion highly engaged monthly users . This is too good an opportunity for retailers to miss out on , '' says Declan Kennedy , CEO of StitcherAds , whose SaaS platform allow retailers to target specific adverts at specific Facebook users at specific times , and even on particular devices . However , the latest data from eMarketer shows that Google gets 47 % of global mobile ad budgets , while Facebook has just 22 % . `` Google has a much more diversified base of mobile revenue , '' says Aaron Goldman , CMO of Kenshoo , and author of Everything I Know About Marketing I Learned From Google . `` It makes money from mobile search ads , display ads , video ads , and in-app ads . It also owns Android and makes money through the Google Play store when people download apps . `` Google is far more dominant on mobile than Facebook . Comscore reports that across mobile web and apps , Google properties ( 27.7m ) reach a third more monthly unique mobile users than Facebook do ( 18.3m ) . Facebook is rated third behind Yahoo – and is about equal to BBC sites and apps . Probably not . `` In the specific space Facebook occupies , there are few that can compete , '' says Vikas Shah , President , TiE Manchester and Visiting Professor of Entrepreneurship at MIT Sloan . `` Users have a huge amount of familiarity and emotional equity in the platform , and to break this you can not just create something which is a little bit better , such Google+ . It has to be something which is a significant leap ahead – and at this stage in the game , something which is perhaps beyond current platform comprehension . '' That 's bad news for Google , whose position as the arbiter of the internet is coming under increasing pressure . `` Google has more than just a 'challenger ' brand struggle on its hands – it also has a cultural and attitudinal shift to make to get the next wave of consumers to adopt and then maintain its platforms , '' says Taylor . `` Google continues to force the issue by baking in '+1 ' and social proof into its search results and YouTube-owned platform , which will gradually force brands into adopting and utilising its network as consumers follow . '' Despite being banned by the 'great firewall ' , Facebook can – and is – breaking China . `` Each month , 16 % of China 's adult internet population say they use Facebook , with millions of Chinese networkers turning to Virtual Private Networks and Proxy Servers in order to bypass the government 's restrictions , '' says Mander . China will be a key market to watch : services like Tencent 's WeChat already have huge followings in China and are now looking to expand elsewhere . Facebook 's presence in this market will become crucial to it maintaining a global dominance – and its weapon is WhatsApp . `` Instagram and WhatsApp may act as trojan horses to help Facebook develop a bigger footprint in Asian territories that may be dominated by other social networking or mobile platforms , '' says Holden . `` In fact , the potential to build a user base in China , even if a minority one , may be one of the most strategically valuable parts of the WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions . '' It 's easy to get carried away with Facebook 's rapid growth , but there are big differences with Google . `` They are being driven from two entirely different places at the moment , '' says Will McInnes , the CMO at social media analytics company Brandwatch . `` Google is primarily driven by data . It 's like an incredibly intelligent piece of string that both guides and follows you throughout your day . Facebook is primarily driven by engagement , by providing spaces where we can spend time engaging with other people and content . Its places are much more defined – its website , its mobile app , Instagram . '' What about Android ? For all of Facebook 's growth in mobile , Google is hardly a bystander . `` Facebook does n't own the operating system layer of our smartphone experiences – Google , Apple and Microsoft play a far bigger role here , '' says Holden . `` The launch of Facebook Home , which intended to change this , has n't been widely adopted and many Home users did n't react well to Facebook 'invading ' the OS experience on their phone . '' Now in over 50 % of phones in the UK , Android is all about built-in Google services . `` Google services are right at the very heart of how we use our mobiles , through search , Google Now , the app marketplace , native applications , mapping and , naturally , the requirement to link every Android device to a Google user ID , '' says Holden . How often do you go online on a smartphone or tablet without using Google search , Youtube , Gmail or Google Maps ? Facebook 's success could be its downfall . Over 11 million users have deserted Facebook , according to Marco Nardone , CEO of Unii.com , a new social networking platform for students launched in May last year . `` I see social media running the risk of becoming too diluted , '' he says . `` Despite Facebook 's strong following , it is an impossible task to try and satisfy everyone 's needs . There 's a real thirst for something that promises to be much more targeted , much more niche and most importantly , more private . `` Features on Unii.com – which has attracted 165,000 active users , or 10 % of students – include society management , opinion polling and photo and content sharing on a private platform , are n't on Facebook and never can be – they 're just too specific to a core target market . `` Facebook is certainly seeing increased mobile adoption and they have a robust understanding of people 's interests , likes , and connections , so in theory , Facebook search has the potential to surface more relevant results than Google , '' says Anders Rosenquist , director of emerging media at creative agency Possible . However , it 's not about beating Google – and those that buy ads on both platforms would prefer that no-one 'wins ' . `` It 's easy to view Facebook and Google solely as competitors , but they can complement each other – for example , search campaigns tend to perform better when run in conjunction with Facebook campaigns , '' says Rosenquist . What Facebook 's aggressive focus on mobile is really about is 'the next billion ' – people in developing countries and fast-growing economies that are connecting to the internet for the first time . Crucially , they 're doing that from a smartphone , not a PC . '' The next billion want what we want now , '' says McInnes . `` The difference is they see the world more clearly and more practically – connectivity changes their lives more profoundly . And they live with more constraints , so they favour simplicity and in particular mobility . `` Google and Facebook have different strategies . Facebook prefers to partner with existing mobile networks and either buy-up or mimic the push-to-talk messaging that could dominate – especially in Asia . `` Google remains well placed to dominate mobile again in Africa , because Android as a free , open source OS is likely to be the default for many new smartphone users in Africa , who make their first Internet connections via a smartphones , not desktops , '' says Holden . With Facebook betting on virtual reality with Oculus Rift and Google dead-set on the internet of things through Waze and Nest , it 's what comes after the smartphone that could decide this battle .

It looks like it 's all-systems-go for Facebook 's free image sharing app , Slingshot , which should launch today on the App Store and Google Play in the US if a blog post on Facebook 's media page is to be believed . In case you missed our earlier coverage , Slingshot aims to shoot Snapchat out of the sky by leveraging its insanely popular social network and provide users a way to visually communicate . What separates the two services ? Well , it 's a bit gimmicky , but in order to see the last image a friend has sent in Slingshot , you 'll need to pony up a pic yourself . This could potentially form a positive feedback loop encouraging more pictures and more conversations between friends . That 's not all that separates these two `` s '' named services though , so read on for a full message-a-message smack down . Theoretically , Slingshot has the edge here . Facebook integration is something natural and intuitive , plus everyone you know most likely already has an account . Snapchat requires your friends to download the app , create an account and then add you . In practice this only takes a few seconds , but if Facebook Messenger is any indication , people like quick and easy integration in an app that all of their friends already own . Slingshot 's other ace-up-its-sleeve is the ability to send a shot to all , yes all , of your friends at once . This sounds wonderful for life-changing events : the birth of a child , buying a new home , getting engaged . But imagine getting updates from that guy you met once at a bar that shows him going to McDonald 's . This could potentially open the door for too many updates and too many uninteresting chats . Oh , and remember , in order to see said McDonald 's chat , you 'll need to send something yourself . Joy . Snapchat has come across the bridge already and included the `` stories '' feature - a way to essentially notify all of your friends at once - and has come out better for it . Still , add in some way to limit the groups ( a feature already built into Facebook ) that an image goes to and Slingshot looks like it could be king of the fading picture castle . Slingshot 1 - Snapchat 0 Realistically this is n't much of a competition . No one is expecting Instagram-level filters on pictures that you can only look at for 10 seconds . As long as there 's a bit of text modification and the ability to haphazardly draw doodles on the screen , this one 's going to end in a draw . Slingshot 2 - Snapchat 1 Features are all well and good , but it 's the meat and potatoes of the product that really matter ; Snapchat may be going out of style like 2013 , but its core tenets make a lot of sense . Where Slingshot requires you to actually respond without seeing an incoming message , Snapchat allows for more natural reactions . Predictive chatting does n't sound all that exciting , and even though it may inspire more back-and-forth verbal repartee . A conversation between two people does n't work by the second person 's response coming before the first has asked a question . Point Snapchat . Slingshot 2 - Snapchat 2 Slingshot is off to a decent start , but it has a lot of ground to cover to catch up to Snapchat 's early launch lead . New features are constantly rolling out to Snapchat 's app - today , for example , the company unveiled `` event sharing '' that allows users to send pictures to an account that will bundle them all together and display a constantly updating feed - while Slingshot has barely put boots to the ground . Whether Slingshot can overcome Snapchat will largely depend on how well it 's adopted by consumers and if the `` you show me yours and I 'll show you mine '' core concept strikes a chord with its users . Both Snapchat and Slingshot are available for free on Android and iOS .
Update : Well , that did n't take very long . Facebook has officially unveiled Slingshot , and it 's setting its sights squarely at Snapchat . `` Photos and videos that do n't stick around forever allow for sharing that 's more expressive , raw and spontaneous , '' the Sling team wrote in an announcement post , noting the new messaging platform is aimed at group sharing - snap a photo or shoot a video , then `` sling it to a bunch of friends . '' The rub is they wo n't see what you 've sent until they sling something back to the sender . If they do n't like what they see - that beach selfie made them just too jealous - they can swipe your shot away . Or , they can reply with a reaction , like , `` OMG watch out for that wave ! '' Or whatnot . The makers of Slingshot even gave a nod to the service 's obvious competitor . `` We 've enjoyed using Snapchat to send each other ephemeral messages and expect there to be a variety of apps that explore this new way of sharing , '' the post continued . `` With Slingshot , we saw an opportunity to create something new and different : a space where you can share everyday moments with lots of people at once . '' Slingshot is available starting today in the US on iPhones with iOS 7 and Android devices running Jelly Bean or KitKat . Original article below ... Call it a clever bit of hype-building , call it a screw up , but Facebook 's Snapchat competitor , Slingshot , made an early appearance on some App Stores last week before vanishing . But it might be time for Slingshot to make its proper and official debut , with one source telling 9to5mac that today is the day we 'll see Facebook roll its app out at some point today . Remember Poke , Facebook 's first attempt at doing the Snapchat thing ? Think that but much better . The service will let users send photos and videos - a la Snapchat - to other users , with the option to deface said media with text and drawing . Perhaps the only real difference is that Slingshot also includes a `` react '' button that allows users to return an instant snapshot reaction to the latest picture of your friend 's lunch . The app will be completely free when it arrives . The source does say , however , that Facebook may hold back the rollout if it comes up against any last-minute snags . We dropped Facebook a line but it refused to comment on the story .

Facebook has released a new version of its iPad app , introducing a new sidebar that encourages users to check out popular games and trending news topics . The latest update , available to download now , adds a column on the right side of the screen similar to the one which on the Facebook.com website . As well as games and news , users will also see calendar events and the weather within the sidebar . Facebook said the update is being made to provide content relevant to how people use tablets today . According to the social network , 70 % of all iPad owners used their tablet to play a game on Facebook over the past three months . Those stats are surprising if true , and it makes sense that Facebook would hope to capitalise on this activity by pushing titles from its developers rather than users going elsewhere to download games from the App Store . The update appears to be US-only right now . Let us know if it 's appearing at your end .

Prefer to be in control of your own destiny ? Facebook will soon hand some of the advertising reins over to users , even though advertisers will be watching what you 're in to from afar . Facebook announced upcoming changes in how it determines what type of advertising it shows users . Users , meanwhile , will finally have a little more say it what ads are presented to them . Instead of mining activity only from Facebook , advertisers will soon be able to tap into other websites and apps frequently used by members to provide `` interest-based advertising '' similar to what Google already does . The new initiative will roll out to Facebook users in the United States over the next few weeks , and will then expand across the globe in the months to come . Even as Facebook expands its advertising reach , the social network has devised a peace offering for members in the form of ad preferences , which enable users more control over what type of ads they see . Facebook offered the example of a consumer researching the purchase of a new television , which would then trigger interest-based advertising in the future for other electronics that could potentially complement such an acquisition . Assuming the TV shopping was a one-time event , Facebook users could then remove electronics from their ad preferences , effectively turning off a potential faucet of similar product offerings to come . Facebook members will also be able to opt out of the new ad targeting on the web using a Digital Advertising Alliance opt out , or the new controls being baked into the iOS and Android mobile apps .

Update : The Slingshot app has now been removed from the App Store with Facebook claiming it was released accidentally . However , the company pledged the official release is coming soon . A Facebook spokesperson told The Verge : `` Earlier today , we accidentally released a version of Slingshot , a new app we 're working on . With Slingshot , you 'll be able to share everyday moments with lots of people at once . It 'll be ready soon and we 're excited for you to try it out . '' Whoops . Original story below ... Facebook has started to roll out a new photo and video messaging app it hopes will combat the very real threat of rival service Snapchat , which it tried and failed to purchase last year . The new Slingshot application , first rumoured in reports last month , has arrived in some markets , although its yet to hit Europe and North America . On the iTunes page , Facebook explains how users can 'sling ' photos and videos to their friends , who will not be able to see what they 've received until they send something back . Users will the be able to annotate and add captions to photos and , like Snapchat , the message will only be viewable for a limited amount of time . Once you `` swipe them away '' they 're gone for good . If users are busy they will have the opportunity to view shots later . The premise differs slightly from Snapchat in that it forces users to exchange media before they have the chance to look at it , which is strange considering the sender wo n't have a clue what they 're responding to . At the time of writing we 're still unable to download the app , so it appears Facebook is going for a staged roll out in different marches . The launch comes after Facebook was rebuffed with a $ 3 billion ( around £1.8bn , AU $ 3.2bn ) offer for Snapchat in November 2013 . According to the reports last month , Facebook began working on its own version in the immediate aftermath and the result is Slingshot . Have you been able to download the app yet ? Let us know if so and what you think below .

Flickr is the latest one of Yahoo 's services to remove third-party logins , as it confirmed today that you wo n't be able to access the service with your Facebook or Google accounts from June 30 . Yahoo made the announcement earlier this year , but now we have an actual date – and even more reason to be annoyed . This means you 'll have to create a Yahoo account if you want to keep using the service . But do n't worry about losing any of your precious pics : your new Yahoo login will be linked to your existing account . Yahoo told TechRadar in a statement : `` Yahoo is continually working on improving the user experience , which includes our sign-in process for Flickr . This process , which asks users to sign in with a Yahoo username , will allow us to offer the best personalized experience to everyone . ''

As you may have heard , Facebook is making a significant change to the way messaging works on its mobile app . Specifically the company is removing the messaging functions from the primary Facebook Mobile app and has begun shunting its users into the separate Facebook Messenger app for chat . And this is the crazy part : it requires an entirely separate download . We all know how onerous it is to download apps these days . It can take tens of seconds for a new app to install , just so you can hate-play Kim Kardashian : Hollywood . The Internet 's response was , of course , measured and nuanced . Ah ha ha ha . Sorry , that one gets me every time . The Internet 's response was the exact opposite of measured and nuanced . In fact , to look at its reaction , you 'd think the company had mounted an armed invasion of Kansas while simultaneously running over everyone 's grandmother and strangling a paralyzed puppy . Now , I 'm always glad to see people getting energized over something truly important ( after we tackle this problem we 're going to get right on climate change and world hunger , right ? ) . But I 'd also like to offer a few words as counterpoint to the prevailing view . Those few words are these : I freaking love Facebook Messenger . Why do I love an app that most people seem so deeply persecuted by ? Because it allows me to use Facebook 's messaging system the way I 'd most like to . Which is to say , without using Facebook . Now let 's get one thing straight up front . I am a happy and willing participant in Facebook and its trademark shallow , scattershot virtual interactions that have permanently devalued both liking something and being someone 's friend . Though we may not actually talk to one another any more , over the past few years my `` friends '' have become extremely good at crafting droll commentary about what they 're doing , how they feel about current events and which puppy videos are the very , very best puppy videos . And I find all of this very entertaining . So I do n't hate Facebook . But I do know I ca n't be trusted with it . Facebook is the most scientifically advanced form of distraction mankind has yet created . Its intoxicating stew of self-absorption/congratulation/loathing results in an endless series of click-holes , available any hour of the night or day , with a reliable percentage of new things I can watch , read , shake a fist at , or comment on . It is the endless regress , the garden of earthly delights , the ultimate entertainment , the abyss from which no man returns ( at least not without an inspiring story about an Ivory Coast cacao farmer that puts EVERYTHING into perspective ) . Thus , much like drinking , catfishing and trolling the comments sections on Diary of a Quilter , Facebook is strictly an after-hours activity for me . As someone who works at a computer all day , if I start allowing Facebook into my daytime routine , I 'm toast . Still , though , I need to communicate with people . And for better or worse , a lot of those people are on Facebook . Facebook remains one of the most reliable ways to get in touch with anyone you 've ever friended , despite any changes to that person 's job/phone number/last name/country of residence/stated racial affiliation . In addition to being a global timesuck and a cause of depression , Facebook is also a messaging service that almost everyone I know is signed up with , most of whom still use it at least occasionally .

If , like us , you were a little peeved that Facebook had broken off the messaging section of its app into a separate application , there 's a good chance you 've stubbornly resisted moving over . But unfortunately Facebook is now forcing people to make the switch . Facebook confirmed to TechRadar that the Messaging section of the conventional iOS and Android apps is soon to be removed . `` In the next few days , we 're continuing to notify more people that if they want to send and receive Facebook messages , they 'll need to download the Messenger app , '' said a spokesperson . `` As we 've said , our goal is to focus development efforts on making Messenger the best mobile messaging experience possible and avoid the confusion of having separate Facebook mobile messaging experiences . Messenger is used by more than 200 million people every month , and we 'll keep working to make it an even more engaging way to connect with people . '' As Facebook reminds us , there have been plenty of pre-warnings ; resisting users of the conventional app will be familiar with Facebook 's constant nagging to switch over to the new Messenger system . But breaking Messenger off into its own entity makes perfect sense for a company that , earlier this year , told us its focus will be on standalone experience . Facebook recently bought Whatsapp for a cool $ 19 billion , so between that and Messenger , Facebook 's plan for mobile messaging domination is shaping up nicely .

The House of Zuckerberg put on the quarterly dog and pony show for investors today , and while there 's plenty of cash to go around , the real story is how many of Facebook 's users are ditching the desktop for greener pastures on mobile . Facebook announced earnings for the second quarter of 2014 , and one thing is clear : The social network is fast becoming a mobile-centric company , with a full 62 % of advertising revenue now generated from smartphones and tablets . Founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg 's former Harvard University project is now home to 1.32 billion users , with people flocking to the social network at a rate of 14 % year over year . The thing to pay attention is just how many of those users are exclusively logging in from mobile devices : 399 million , or about 30 % of the site 's total user base , with plenty more apparently on the way as mobile growth increased 31 % in the last year . All of the above translated to bigger quarterly profits for Facebook , with a 61 % increase to $ 2.91 billion ( about £1.71b , AU $ 3.08b ) in revenue , handily beating Wall Street analyst expectations with earnings of 42 cents per share for the second quarter , which ended June 30 . Facebook also somehow managed to spend less over the last three months , more than doubling quarterly profits to $ 791 million ( about £464m , AU $ 838m ) , a 138 % increase over the same period last year , which eked out a mere $ 333 million profit ( about £196m , AU $ 353m ) . Not surprisingly , the majority of Facebook 's quarterly revenue ( $ 2.68 billion , about £1.57b , AU $ 2.84b ) came from advertising , a 67 % increase over last year 's June quarter , with a whopping 62 % of ad revenue generated from mobile devices . Facebook executives plan to leverage video-based advertising to help grow future revenue , and expects to keep operating in an aggressive `` investment mode '' through 2015 on the heels of the recent Oculus Rift and WhatsApp acquisitions .
Facebook 's new Mentions app is exclusively for celebrities with verified accounts , meaning that until the TechRadar band finally takes off , we 're unable to test it for ourselves . That means we 'll have to rely on the stars themselves to scrutinise the new app , and there 's really only one person for the job : William Shatner . Unfortunately his verdict is one big thumbs down , but the guy certainly gives the app a thorough working over on Shatner Speaks , leading to a riveting conclusion : `` I 'm not quite sure why Facebook released this app for `` celebrities '' . It seems to be ill conceived . I will probably use it to post to my Facebook when I 'm on my phone but it does n't allow for mail or groups . I will continue to use my regular Facebook app as well as the Pages app . '' Thanks Bill , we salute you . If you fancy reviewing some phones , you know where to find us . Shatner : not a proven fan of blips . Yet .

It 's official : Facebook is now the proud owner of virtual reality 's biggest champion , Oculus VR . It was announced back in March that the social network would be snapping up the creator of the Oculus Rift headset . `` We 're looking forward to an exciting future together , building the next computing platform and reimagining the way people communicate , '' read a joint statement confirming that all paperwork had been signed and all hands shaken , which was spotted by CVG . Understandably , the internet has n't respond too positively to the acquisition , but Imre Jele , co-founder of Bossa Studios ( creator of VR title Surgeon Simulator ) and BAFTA games committee member , told TechRadar that Oculus has promised him things will not change under the new regime . `` I 'm not going to name the person , but I got an email from one of my mates at Oculus [ on the night of the announcement ] , '' he told us . `` It basically just said in the subject 'Please do n't worry , nothing will change . Let 's talk later . ' It 's funny because they knew it was going to be perceived badly . '' Imre also said he believes Facebook could turn out to be `` the best thing to ever happen to VR '' , but that the money will not be made from the headset itself . 'The long term game is not hardware , '' he said . `` I 'm speculating here , but I think they want to control the access to content . Selling the hardware is great , but how often can you sell a new headset ? `` But they have the financial and cultural reach that 's needed . And it 's not just games . I know there are some studios already experimenting with films and other forms of entertainment… if anyone has the power to make something mass market , it 's Facebook '' Jele also speculated that the price of the Rift will be `` somewhere between two hundred and three hundred and fifty dollars '' when we 're finally able to escape into the Oculus metaverse , which will hopefully be before 2015 is through .

Facebook has introduced a new 'save it for later ' feature that allows users to store interesting web links , pages , movies , TV shows and music for a more convenient time . The new 'Save ' tool , which is rolling out to the web , iOS and Android apps , makes it easier to keep track of interesting News Feed content without it getting lost in the scroll-through shuffle . The Saved content , be it a checked-in restaurant the user may wish to try or a shared album they want to hear , will be accessible via the 'More ' tab on mobile and within the sidebar on the web . The feature apes the functionality offered by apps like Pocket and the Reading List feature in Apple 's Safari web browser but with a Facebook funk . The social network is taking it upon itself to remind users about their Saved content if they do n't check it after a period of time . Such is the exponential growth of sharing web content on Facebook , the feature comes at a time when many users are struggling to keep up with everything posted by their friends . While checking out interesting links over the lunch break can offer a welcome distraction from the grind , an all-day presence on social media can be a productivity catastrophe . The Save option will let users get work done while promising the treat of Facebook-saved content for the commute home , all without the risk of being infiltrated by a trillion Buzzfeed posts .

Facebook is testing a new feature that lets you buy items directly from businesses without ever leaving the social network 's web . The test gets off the ground today , letting people purchase goods through a `` Buy '' button on News Feed ads and Page posts . As shown in a mock-up , suggested or sponsored posts look exactly the same save for the attention-grabbing Buy button located under the item 's image . Users will find the option to buy available on both desktop and mobile versions of Facebook . Those concerned about privacy need not worry , Facebook said , as it 's `` taken steps to help make the payment experience safe and secure . '' No credit or debit card info shared with Facebook will leave hands to other advertisers and users will have the choice of whether to save payment details for future purchases or not . The test is small - it 's limited to a few small and medium-sized businesses in the US , though more information , presumably on a greater rollout , is due once Facebook gathers feedback . Facebook has a historical problem making money for others , so the hope behind the new feature is to help businesses drive sales . If it works , this will presumably lead to more businesses using Facebook for more than just status updates , thus creating a circle of mutual benefit and happiness all around . Of course , much depends on users and if they feel the Buy button is an advertiser intrusion or a useful purchasing tool , and only time can tell if either is the case .
It 's lifestyles of the rich and famous for the digital age . Facebook 's new Mentions app for iOS is only on offer for celebrities and brands with verified accounts , giving them a slimmed down and trussed up version of the social network to see what 's being said about them and other high rollers . Actors , athletes , musicians and other influencers are the intended Mentions user base , and the app not only lets them peek social network chatter but also provides a more manageable means to interact with the masses . Mentions also acts as a sort of living timeline for jet setters , letting them upload pics , videos and hold live Q & As . Finally , Mentions provides a stream of trending topics so Justin Timberlake and other busy famous types can see what 's hot and decide whether they deign it worth a comment or not . It 's really a way for public figures to manage their interactions , a Facebook product manager told Variety , but also clearly a move to help Facebook court celebrities who prefer Twitter 's more direct and easier to manage set-up . Facebook figures show celebrities who tested Mentions posted twice as much content per day as they did before using the app , as well as interacted with other famous people twice as much as they did previously . However , the increase in activity could be a result of the app 's bright-and-shininess and not necessarily because of usefulness , so we 'll have to wait and see whether Mentions has more lasting power than Rebecca Black .

Two internet titans are joining forces to bring renewed life to those crusty old JPEG files by cutting them down to size . Mozilla announced that the decades-old JPEG file format is about to get a little more efficient when it comes to bandwidth consumption , thanks to the combined resources of the creators of Firefox and social networking giant Facebook . The new partnership builds upon the second generation of Mozilla 's mozjpeg encoder , a home-brewed solution capable of shaving an average of 5 % off the size of JPEG files without a noticeable loss in quality . In many cases , Mozilla claims , mozjpeg 2.0 can reduce file sizes even further . This is all done without having to throw the baby out with the bath water by adopting an entirely new image format specifically designed for the web . Facebook has good reason to embrace such technology ; the social network processes millions of photos each and every day , and even a seemingly modest 5 % could reap big rewards when it comes to bandwidth . `` We look forward to seeing the potential benefits mozjpeg 2.0 might bring in optimizing images and creating an improved experience for people to share and connect on Facebook , '' said Stacy Kerkela , the social network 's software engineering manager . The alliance with Facebook is likely to be viewed as another setback for Microsoft 's JPEG XR and WebP , a Google-backed image format supported by Opera . Mozilla criticized them last year for failing to offer any significant improvements over JPEG , a standard that dates back to 1986 . Mozilla is actively recruiting other as-yet unnamed websites to adopt mozjpeg 2.0 , while simultaneously donating a $ 60,000 ( about £34,998 , AU $ 64,050 ) contribution to further develop the technology , with an eye toward mozjpeg 3.0 .

Ah , Friday . The sun is shining , the weekend is nigh and Hugh Langley is back in the office , regaling us with tales of his heart-stopping trek through the countryside . Apparently , he saw a bird at one point . And possibly a sheep . Of course , being stuck in the middle of nowhere for the past week means we 've had to bring our young survivalist up to speed with what 's been happening back in the civilised world . First up : news that Microsoft could be bringing a smartwatch or smartband of its own to the already-crowded wearables table . We have n't seen much other than a couple of leaked patents for now , but with a sea of Android-based smartwatches already on the market and Android Wear about to go big , Microsoft needs a serious USP if it hopes to be anything more than another face in the crowd . Facebook has also been causing widespread outrage yet again , this time after revealing it 's been actively manipulating our news feeds in an emotion-altering experiment reminiscent of something from a George Orwell novel . You can hear this and loads more tech-themed goodness in this week 's TechRadar Show . Tune in below , and be sure to leave us your thoughts afterwards .
If this week had a sound that sound would be `` wheeeeee ! '' or maybe `` gnnnnnh ! '' - that 's our impression of BMW 's tech-filled and faintly frightening M3 sports car , which can put a smile on even the most sombre face . But BMW 's not the only firm that can change people 's moods : Facebook 's been at it too , and the internet has a frowny face as a result . It 's Week in Tech ! The internet is ANGRY , and this time it might have a point : Facebook has been manipulating users ' News Feeds to try and change people 's moods . It 's probably legal , but seems rather unethical : `` Nobody was asked whether they wanted to participate in what is effectively a psychological study , '' we report , and it 's `` arguably irresponsible too : how many of the people whose news feeds were made more negative were people with vulnerable emotional states or mental illnesses such as depression ? '' Samsung has hammered another nail into the coffin of plasma TV : it 's going to build its last plasma set in November of this year , and then it 's going to switch focus to 4K and curved TVs instead . Panasonic 's already out of the plasma business , and reports suggest that it wo n't be long before LG stops too . So what kind of TV should you buy if plasma 's on the way out ? Allow us to help with our in-depth guide to the best TVs of 2014 . Got a Nexus 4 , 5 , 7 or 10 ? We 've got good news : you 'll be able to get Google 's super soaraway Android L operating system . The code has already been made available to developers , but we mere mortals will probably have to wait for the official release in September or October . Does Microsoft want you to wear Windows ? It certainly sounds like it : it 's working on a Samsung Gear Fit-style fitness device that 'll go on sale later this year . It 's a fitness tracker rather than a smartwatch , and because this is the New Microsoft it wo n't just be for Windows Phone users : it 'll work on Android and iOS too . We 've looked at two very different Galaxies this week : Samsung 's giant Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and the teeny-tiny Galaxy S5 Mini . Thanks to a ( now-removed ) typo in our review we can exclusively reveal that the former is a `` power horse '' , but like many pretend horses it 's `` let down by the rear… which feels less than premium . '' Meanwhile the S5 Mini is n't actually that mini : with a 4.5-inch display it 's bigger than previous Minis and only a little bit smaller than the full-sized S5 . BMW 's M3 is `` a game changer '' , says Jeremy Laird , pulling doughnuts in the car park : it 's `` stupendously , staggeringly , sickeningly quick '' and packed with more tech than a terminator . It 's the most configurable M3 ever and `` an exceptional achievement . '' Imagine a world without the WalkMan . There 'd be no iPod , no Wired for Sound by Cliff Richard and no `` home taping is killing music '' campaign . Sony 's smash hit is a terrifying 35 years old , and while the name lives on the iconic tape-based player is long gone . `` There are lessons here for Apple , '' Ian Morris writes : the WalkMan put Sony at the top of the consumer tech tree , but by the time it made its last tape-based WalkMan in 2009 it was losing money hand over fist . Making music hardware is just like making music : you 're only as good as your last hit .

If you 're wondering what it would have been like for those 689,000 guinea pigs who had their emotions manipulated by that controversial Facebook News Feed experiment ? Well now you can . Sort of . With more than a hint of sarcasm , one developer has built a FB Mood Manipulator plug-in for the Google Chrome web browser , allowing users to select which emotions they see reflected within status updates . Using a progressive slider , users choose to see more or less Positive , Emotional , Aggressive and Open posts , with the News Feed automatically updating to account for words that fit the parameters . Those four emotions were used by Facebook in its emotional contagion study , which found users posted more positively or negatively when exposed to similar emotions within their News Feeds . `` Why should Zuckerberg get to decide how you feel ? Take back control . Leverage Facebook 's own research to manipulate your emotions on your terms , '' writes New York-based developer Lauren McCarthy . Of course , we took the Mood Manipulator for a quick spin . Requesting more positive emotions summoned happy posts containing words like ; outstanding , phenomenal , rock , rule , proud , fun , sun , lovely , great and love . Now we feel all warm inside , although that could be the faulty air conditioning inside this Starbucks . Regardless , the Mood Manipulator seems like a viable way of getting rid of those Negative Nancys clogging up the News Feed on those days you need a little more sunshine in your life . Give it a spin and let us know your thoughts below .
No more having to reach into your pocket to message someone back via Facebook while browsing on the iPad , thanks to the universal build now available . Facebook today updated the standalone Facebook Messenger app for iOS to version 7.0 , and iPad owners finally have something to cheer about now that the app works natively on their favorite smartphone as well as tablet . If that was n't enough for iOS users to get excited about , the update also allows videos shot inside of the Messenger app to be saved to the device Camera Roll , where they can be shared to other apps as well . Facebook is also making it easier than ever to invite friends already using the social network to join the ranks of Messenger users , and promises the app will also be `` more reliable '' thanks to other , unspecified fixes . Now a universal build offering a native experience across iPhone , iPod touch or iPad from a single app , Facebook Messenger 7.0 appears to be making the most of the larger tablet display . On the iPad , the Recent , Groups , People and Settings tab now appear on the left edge of the screen in both portrait and landscape views , while your ongoing conversions have plenty of room to breathe on the righthand side . The iPad is also a great place to send friends some of those decorative Facebook stickers , which are now displayed across the bottom of the screen , where they presumably look pretty awesome on a Retina Display . Otherwise , Facebook Messenger 7.0 for iOS offers the usual complement of free text and call options ( including internationally ) , private photo sharing , the ability to record voice messages and one-tap access to jump between Messenger and Facebook apps .
Facebook has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons : last week it emerged that nearly a quarter of a million users ' news feeds were deliberately manipulated to see if such manipulation could change their moods . Critics say that 's unethical at best and downright evil at worst , and the UK Information Commissioner 's Office has announced that it will investigate whether Facebook has breached data protection legislation . Facebook in privacy shocker . Hold the front page ! This is a bit bigger than the usual `` let 's move all the privacy settings and make your pics public again '' changes Facebook likes to make . Is it ? What actually happened ? For a week in 2012 , Facebook data scientists meddled with the news feeds of over 689,000 users as part of a study with Cornell University and the University of California . Some users were shown more negative content ; others , more positive . Facebook then analysed those users ' own posts to see if the content they were shown had made them more positive or more negative . Surely sites and social networks analyse user data all the time ? They do , and it 's called A/B testing : you give two groups of users different versions of your content and see which is more successful . This goes beyond that , though : Facebook was n't just observing users , but actively trying to change their emotions . And that 's bad because ... ? It 's bad because nobody was asked whether they wanted to participate in what is effectively a psychological study . Facebook does mention that it 'll use your data for research in its terms and conditions , but that bit of the T & Cs was n't added until after this experiment had already taken place . It 's arguably irresponsible too : how many of the people whose news feeds were made more negative were people with vulnerable emotional states or mental illnesses such as depression ? What did the study find ? The cheerier your feed , the cheerier your posts are likely to be , and vice versa . The more emotional the language used , the more you 're likely to post ; if your feed is full of fairly flat and unexciting language , you 'll be less inclined to join in . How have people reacted to the news of the study ? The reaction of Erin Kissane ( Director of Content at OpenNews ) on Twitter was typical : `` Get off Facebook . Get your family off Facebook . If you work there , quit . They 're f -- -ing awful . '' What does Facebook say about it ? `` Mumble mumble mumble . Look ! A duck ! '' Really ? No . In a statement Facebook said : `` This research was conducted for a single week in 2012 and none of the data used was associated with a specific person 's Facebook account . We do research to improve our services and to make the content people see on Facebook as relevant and engaging as possible . '' In a public Facebook post , study co-author Adam Kramer wrote : `` Our goal was never to upset anyone ... in hindsight , the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety . '' So they 've apologised ? Kinda . Sorta . Not really . Chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg made one of those non-apology apologies so beloved of celebrities and politicians : the study was `` poorly communicated , and for that communication we apologise . We never meant to upset you . '' Translation : we 're not sorry we did it , but we 're sorry that you 're annoyed about it .

No one likes advertising intruding on their online experience , but Facebook is looking for ways to deliver more relevant ads to users of its social network by acquiring one of the companies responsible for feeding such content to big media brands . Facebook today announced an agreement to acquire LiveRail , an advertising technology company best known for wedging themselves between content providers and users with online video ads . Founded in 2007 , LiveRail currently powers the advertising pushed to websites and apps owned by Major League Baseball , ABC , A & E Networks , Gannett and Dailymotion , specializing in the delivery of only the most relevant ad content . With hundreds of millions of digital video viewers watching LiveRail-powered advertising each and every month , Facebook aims to satisfy publishers and marketers alike with more `` interesting and engaging '' online ads . Facebook Vice President of Ads Product Marketing and Atlas Brian Boland describes LiveRail as `` a complete advertising solution for video publishers , '' although the announcement Wednesday does n't offer details on how the acquisition might improve the experience for social network users already fatigued by online ads . At least for now , Facebook plans to keep LiveRail and its staff of 170 people operating independently of the House That Zuckerberg Built , although Boland hopes to use the combined expertise to `` make video advertising much better for everyone . '' Although Facebook has primarily focused advertising on the web thus far , the clock is ticking on that front after announcing a mobile ad network initiative called Facebook Audience Network at the F8 conference back in May . The acquisition of LiveRail is likely to dovetail nicely with Facebook 's own burgeoning advertising network , which the social network hopes to expand beyond the walls of its own branded mobile apps .
After getting caught red-handed experimenting with news feeds in order to affect users ' emotions , Facebook has come out with an official apology . During a visit to New Delhi , India , Facebook 's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg apologized , saying that the company had communicated poorly on the experiment , the USA Today reports . This latest statement from Sandberg is a reaction to the recent news uncovering a Facebook experiment from 2012 , which artificially tweaked the news feeds of 689,003 users . The social network ran an experiment for one week to see how showing more depressing or more positive stories would affect the user 's own status updates as well as posts . `` This was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products , and that was what it was ; it was poorly communicated , '' said Sandberg . Facebook is n't just feeling the backlash from its community of users . Authorities from around the world – including the British data protection authorities , Ireland , and France - are currently investigating the legality of the experiment . In response to the investigation , Times of India reports Sandberg also explained Facebook is working closely with regulators around the world . `` [ W ] e are fully in compliance [ with regulations ] , '' the Facebook COO expounded . `` We know this because we have these dialogues and we have felt very confident there . '' `` We take privacy very seriously . It is the hallmark of our service , it is the underpinning of our service , '' she added . Sure it is .

It 's been a week to get the emotions running . Amazon kicked things off by announcing it will be acquiring Twitch , causing a lot of gamers to uncharacteristically take to the internet to express their disapproval . And just as we were reaching breaking point with the ridiculous number of spam videos appearing on our Facebook feeds , Zuck has stepped in to announce he 's going to fix it . And with IFA 2014 just hours away , we discuss the biggest things we hope to see at the big bad Berlin show . Oh , and at one point Marc gets distracted by a fly . This is what happens when he skips breakfast . Facebook spam : where it 's from and how to stop it

Tired of seeing posts on Facebook telling you to `` click to see more '' ? Well so is Facebook as the social network is attempting to minimize how often spammy click-bait headlines show up in everyone 's News Feeds . The social network announced it 's updating the News Feed to minimize click-baiting , or headlines that suggest users `` CLICK to find out '' and tease `` You 'll NEVER believe what happened next . '' From now on pages that get a lot of clicks wo n't simply rise to the top . Rather posts that users spend an appreciable amount of time spend reading away from Facebook will be given greater presence . In turn the social network hopes these richer stories will encourage more engagement and conversations . On the flip-side if users click though to a story and flip right back to their News Feed , Facebook will deem these posts as click-bait and reduce their visibility on the website . Facebook noted it 's making this change in an effort to please its user base . Supposedly the results of a Facebook survey discovered 80 % of users wanted headlines that would help inform them about the story before actually clicking through to it . Facebook also announced a second News Feed update focused on making sure posts with an included link in the text are promoted over links buried in photo captions . Facebook claims that embedded links are simply easier for mobile devices users to tap on . Both these changes will be ultra important to social media managers , forcing them to change up their sharing strategies . As for the rest of us , we can all rejoice that now we 'll see far fewer posts that read `` You 'll NEVER guess what happened next '' and more that actually inform us about what 's going on in the world .

If your Facebook news feed seems awfully full of ads lately , you 're not alone : many of us are logging on to something that looks rather like the famous Monty Python `` spam '' sketch where everything on the menu involves spam . Some of the things you 're seeing are organic , so for example if you click like on a page or app the recommendations that pop up are n't paid-for , but instead Facebook 's best guesses about what else you might be interested in . But many ads are paid-for , and that 's largely because it 's getting harder and harder for brands to reach people . Facebook tells businesses that on average their pages only reach 16 % of their fans , and one of its solutions is the sponsored post . The business chooses the location , interests , age and gender of the people it wants to target and how much it wants to spend , and Facebook inserts the posts into the appropriate users ' news feeds . The bad news is such ads are here to stay , because they are a key part of Facebook 's revenue strategy . But the good news is that you can limit what you see . The more Facebook knows about you , the more it can target you with ads - so if you 've diligently filled in lots of information about your interests , likes and dislikes then you 're making the advertisers ' job easier . Be wary about the information you give to apps , too : does an app that displays a picture of a kitten really need to know every single thing about you ? Facebook can customise adverts based on your activity on other sites , and while there 's an opt-out it 's hardly well-advertised : click on settings > adverts and scroll down to the second to last paragraph , where there 's an opt out text link that takes you to the opt out page . This wo n't stop ads from appearing , for that you 'll need an ad blocker such as AdBlock Plus . But it will stop sites you 've visited outside Facebook chasing you around on Facebook . The opt-out is per-browser and per-device , so if you use multiple browsers you 'll need to opt out in each one ( and opt out again any time you clear your cookies ) . The equivalent mobile setting is limit ad tracking . You can reject specific ads in your news feed too . Click on the arrow at the top right hand corner of an unwanted ad and choose `` I do n't want to see this '' and you 'll be given the option to hide all ads from that particular organisation . One source of Facebook spam might be you - or rather , your use of the like button . It 's easy to end up liking lots of stuff . Annoyingly , competitions often make it a condition of entry , and sometimes clicking like on a friends ' post is a good way of indicating approval without getting into a conversation about it . Unfortunately those likes make a huge difference to what you see on Facebook . When Wired 's Mat Honan decided to hit like on every single thing posted to his Facebook news feed , his friends ' posts quickly disappeared under an avalanche of advertising and political extremism . Not only that , but his endless liking polluted his friends ' feeds too . Writing on Medium , Elan Morgan tried the opposite approach : instead of using the like button , she left nice comments on things instead . `` I feel as though reason has been restored , '' she writes . `` I can comment on a cute cat photo without being inundated with all the animal videos 800 people shared this week , and I can comment on a post about race relations without then having Facebook trot out an endless showcase of vitriol . '' It does seem as if on Facebook , the less you like the more you 'll like it . Some of the more irritating kinds of Facebook spam are the mass invitation , where someone installs an app and it automatically contacts everybody in their network , and the unwanted update , where an app tells someone 's entire network what they 're doing . The first kind of spam is also used to promulgate scams , and you can avoid them by taking the same approach you would to email : be suspicious of links from people who do n't usually post links , do n't authorise anything you 're not 100 % sure of and assume that if something looks too good to be true , it probably is . If you do get suckered you can zap the app from settings > apps . It 's quite common to be spammed from an account you do n't want to unfollow . For example you might get invitations to play games you 're not interested in , or automated messages telling you that somebody 's done something in a particular app . The good news is that you can shoot the messages without also shooting the messenger , so if you do n't care what somebody 's reading on Goodreads you can click on the arrow in the top right hand corner of the post and select `` hide all from Goodreads '' . If you suspect your apps are boring everybody else , you can limit their posts in settings > apps . Being able to block individual apps is great , but sometimes the problem is n't the apps but a single person who installs lots and lots of the damned things and invites you to try every single one . Once again you can solve that without unfollowing them : go into settings > blocking and block app invites . The section below enables you to block specific users ' event invitations . If you 're receiving unwanted Facebook messages you can use the report a message link , you can set stricter filtering so that any messages that are n't from close friends end up in the other folder , or you can block the sender altogether . It 's worth noting that while filtering can be effective , it does n't get rid of everything : messages can still appear if you 're included in a group message , if someone who is n't on Facebook contacts you using the Messenger app or , annoyingly , because `` someone you 're not connected to on Facebook may pay to ensure their message is routed to your inbox instead of your other folder . '' Thanks , Facebook , thanks a bunch ! If you 'd rather not be notified about every single thing that happens on Facebook , you can cut down the babble in settings > notifications . For example you might limit email notifications to security concerns only , or group notifications so that you 're notified of friends ' posts but not other peoples ' .

Updated : A Facebook spokesperson told TechRadar that the social network has already prepared an update to address the issue described below , in which clicking a web link from native iPhone apps can force your phone to automatically make a call , potentially to expensive or harmful numbers . Facebook 's iOS app fix should go out any time now , but that still leaves many other apps vulnerable . Original story follows… Ideally tapping on a phone number on your iPhone will prompt a pop-up asking whether you want to place a call , but one developer says he found a dangerous vulnerability in apps that do n't ask first . This security hole could let attackers force your phone to make a call when you click on a website link , potentially connecting your phone to expensive numbers without warning . Developer Andrei Neculaesei of Copenhagen company Airtame described the issue on his blog , demonstrating how he created a web page with a link that opens a phone call automatically when accessed from certain native iOS apps . It reportedly works because these apps , including Facebook Messenger , Apple 's Facetime , Google+ , Gmail , and others , do n't issue a pop-up when users tap a phone number within them . Neculaesei says he used `` some sneaky-beaky-like JavaScript '' to make links embedded in websites click themselves . When those sites are accessed through apps other than Safari , the links automatically activate and the calls are placed . He imagines even more severe dangers than being charged for expensive calls , like users accessing a link through Facetime and automatically transmitting a live video feed to attackers - a tactic he 's named `` Hello Pretty ! '' `` Facetime calls are instant , '' he writes . `` Imagine you clicking a link , your phone calls my ( attacker ) account , I instantly pick it up and ( yes ) save all the frames . Now I know how your face looks like and maybe where you are . Hello pretty ! '' He also warns that although this applies to far more apps than the four he mentions , it 's not only Apple 's fault , since third-party app developers can configure their software to prompt users when a phone number is tapped . Many , including big names like Google and Facebook , simply choose not to , but that could very well change in light of this discovery . We 've asked Google , Facebook and Apple for comment , and we 'll update here if we hear back . Facebook forcing us to download Messenger is a brilliant move Via PC World

Facebook paid out $ 1.5 million in bounties last year for users finding bugs in its system , and it 's now extending that incentive to the Oculus Rift . Now that it owns the virtual reality headset , it 's asking users to report any bugs they stumble across while using the Rift , according to The Verge - and it 'll pay a minimum of $ 500 a time . The bad news is that most of the current bugs lie in Oculus ' website and the developer messaging system , rather than the headset itself . Still , there 's the possibility that more problems will appear in the hardware and SDK in the future , so all you Rifters best keep a virtual eye out .

They say `` sarcasm is the lowest form of wit '' and by 'they ' we mean people who 're unable to master it , because , clearly , sarcasm is awesome . However , for those poor souls who just do n't get satire and tend to explode with outrage ( we all know one ) whenever they stumble upon an article from The Onion , Facebook has a solution . ArsTechnica has noticed Facebook dealing a crippling blow to the art by placing a 'satire ' tag next to satirical articles , when they 're shared on the social network . The company admitted it is testing out the notification , which places the word in brackets in front of links from satirical websites , which does indeed include The Onion . As Facebook is only testing the feature right now , it 's by no means a lock to roll out to everyone . However , does satire remain satire if it 's labelled satire ? Is Facebook really going to the art to aid the vast minority who do n't appreciate it ? Does Facebook think its users are stupid ? Share your thoughts below .

Google 's working on the next update to its Hangouts experience , and this one will allegedly bring some pretty big interface changes . The new look , uncovered by notorious Google leaker Florian Kiersch and codenamed 'Ultra Violet ' , will display your contacts ' photos in small circles , just like Facebook 's floating Chat Heads that feature on its app . There also seems to be a new conversation window that pulls together all of your ongoing chats into one place . This discovered version was an extension of the Google desktop Chrome browser , but it 's highly likely that it will come to mobile too . The source said that there will be a number of other design changes too , but was n't able to provide any details on what they might be . But as you can see in the screenshots , this looks like it 'll be a pretty significant overhaul of Google Hangouts , which has struggled to achieve prominence in the face of its bigger messaging rivals . No word on when we might see Google roll out this update , but we 're crossing out fingers that this will be an overhaul across all devices - and one that will happen soon . Via Android Police

Twitter might be the next social network to incorporate video advertisements into users News Feeds , with the firm revealing it has spent much of 2014 testing the new money-spinning feature . In a blog post , Twitter explained how it has been building videos into its media-friendly 'Cards ' interface to allow one-tap playback . The company said it is now ready for a beta test of Promoted Videos , which could spell another influx of tweets from brands and companies users have little interest in following . `` By using Promoted Video , '' the firm wrote on its advertising blog , `` it 's easy for brands to upload and distribute video on Twitter , and to measure the reach and effectiveness of this content . '' The announcement from Twitter comes following Facebook 's deployment of video ads within it 's own portals and photo ads on its Instagram photo-sharing app . Twitter has already come under fire this month after news emerged the company was experimenting with integrating tweets from accounts followed by users ' friends , yet not the users themselves . This was on top of its promoted and sponsored tweets . With video also added into the mix , will there by much timeline real estate left for , you know , folks Twitter users actually follow ?

Facebook continues its streak of acquisitions with the purchase of online security firm PrivateCore . The California-based security company was founded in 2012 by industry veterans from Google and VMware , according to its official site . Neither Facebook nor PrivateCore disclosed financial details concerning the deal , but Facebook said it will use the company 's tech to help secure its servers and protect them from malware , hackers and more . And just in time , too , as researchers this week revealed one of the biggest online data heists in history , with 1.2 billion credentials stolen by a single Russian hacker ring . As data breaches like that and 2013 's massive Target hack show , security needs to be a big priority for major tech companies . `` Facebook and PrivateCore have an aligned mission , '' PrivateCore CEO Oded Horovitz wrote on his company 's site . `` Facebook has done more than any company to connect the world , and we want to use our secure server technology to help make the world 's connections more secure . '' He said Facebook will eventually implement PrivateCore 's tech to protect Facebook users . `` Working together with Facebook , there is a huge opportunity to pursue our joint vision at scale with incredible impact , '' he added . Facebook 's shopping spree has also included companies ranging from messaging service WhatsApp to virtual reality pioneers Oculus VR .

Facebook is reportedly holding talks with major Hollywood studios and film directors with a view to securing custom-made virtual reality movie experiences for the Oculus Rift headset . The Information ( paywall ) brings word from four sources claiming Facebook wants to bring exclusive 'Oculus Experiences ' to users and has reached out to the likes of Fox , Disney , Warner , Sony and Universal . Those experiences would be companions to movie releases , according to those familiar with the talks , but could even result in full-length , immersive movies landing directly on the VR device some day . A drive towards bringing high-profile video content to the Rift is aimed at ensuring the device is n't pigeonholed into the gaming market , the report also claims . Since snapping up Oculus for a cool $ 2 billion ( around £1.2b , AU $ 2.15b ) earlier this year , Facebook has set about broadening the VR appeal beyond gaming , from which almost all Rift hype has arisen . Upon sealing the deal , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke of Oculus ' potential as a `` mass communication tool , '' prompting speculation the firm may look to create a virtual Second Life-style experience . While turning our online world into a cerebral place would certainly give the Rift new purpose , altering the cinematic experience by virtually placing viewers within the scene would surely be just as epochal . Exciting times ahead .

A class action lawsuit filed against Facebook in the European Union over the way it handles user data has reached its target of 25,000 supporters , all of whom will now be requesting damages . The suit , filed against Facebook earlier this week , alleges the way the social network monitors its users around its site and across the web contravenes EU data protection laws . The plaintiff , Max Schrems , is campaigning against products like Graph Search , which shows other users ' activity on the site , and external website tracking through the Facebook Like button . 26-year old Schrems , from Vienna in Austria , wants Facebook to pay damages of €500 ( $ 667 , £396 ) to each of the first 25,000 people who signed up to the cause . Schems , who is also concerned about the way Facebook is using Big Data to gain insights into users habits , as well as its relationship with the NSA , plans to share the funds among supporters if he wins . He told the BBC : `` It is not an epic fight with Facebook but more of a general question of where we are going and if we respect our fundamental rights in Europe . `` Right now I have the feeling that we love to point the finger at the US in Europe , and say they are not respecting our privacy . But the reality is that we do n't really do anything about it - we complain , then go home and drink beer . '' Facebook has yet to comment on the case .
Bad news for Twitter pros : it looks like your feed is going to get a little more spammy if Twitter 's latest bright idea sticks . Fed up with people retweeting stuff you do n't care about ? Twitter 's about to do it on their behalf . Twitter 's latest idea is to let you see posts from people that you do n't follow , but your followees do . The problem with that , of course , is that if you wanted to follow those accounts you 'd already have followed them . You can see the problem on Facebook already , where it tells you that people you know 'Like ' sports you are n't interested in , political views you find absolutely abhorrent , hoaxes that were debunked before you were born , celebs you do n't care about , and all kinds of made-up crystal-chomping new-age nonsense . You 'd think that Twitter would look at the increasingly horrendous Facebook news feed and vow never to do anything like it - but that 's because you do n't have to find new ways to make money from Twitter . In much the same way sharks have to keep swimming to stay alive , web services have to continue growing in order to keep their investors happy - even if that means upsetting the old-timers . I think Twitter owes a lot of its success to Facebook : the bigger and more annoying Facebook became , the more attractive Twitter felt by comparison . I 'm sure I 'm not the only person who 's described Twitter as `` Facebook without all the crap '' . The thing is , Facebook was like that once . People liked Facebook a lot because it was MySpace without all the crap . MySpace , of course , has n't been the world 's favourite social network for a long time now , and that 's because it blew it . As MySpace proved , social networks that go too heavy on the advertising and sponsored-this and promoted- that and forget about the users can end up driving their users away . MySpace did it , Facebook appears to be doing it and Twitter is at least thinking about it . The challenge is to balance the signal - the content we actually care about - with noise , all the stuff we 're not interested in and do n't go online to see such as promoted tweets and inline ads . Our feeds are already full of content we do n't necessarily want - for example political content from people we follow for work reasons , or personal stuff from people we follow because they retweet funny videos - and the more unsolicited content Twitter sticks in there , the lower the signal to noise ratio becomes . It 's rather like having a favourite pub invaded by yelling yahoos : if they visit too often the regulars will soon find somewhere more conducive to conversation .

For a site supposedly built around the idea of maintaining friendships , Facebook 's doing an awfully good job of creating large numbers of enemies who seriously 'unlike ' its current strategy . This week saw the social site make a renewed push to get everyone to install its standalone Messenger app , a tool that pulls out the chat tab from the main Facebook mobile app and is compulsory if you want to continue using the service 's private chat system . The idea of having to install a separate app just to access the same features that have been cut from the full Facebook app has infuriated many users , especially people stuck on older phones with their onboard memory already pushed to bursting point . It 's either a cynical advertising space play , a delivering phone numbers and texts messages to the NSA play , or a sign that Facebook 's set to do a MySpace by the end of 2014 and explode amid mass user fury . Either way , plenty of people are ( pretending to be ) uninstalling the whole thing and ( pretending to be ) quitting Facebook itself in a massive sulk over the changes . PC World commenter Jeannie Oden d'Hal has a surprisingly hardcore , and slightly paranoid , way around it all . She commented : `` If you root your phone so that Facebook is not in the bloatware , then do n't download either one . I use it straight from the website browser and delete my cache , history , data when I log out . The heavy battery use of the apps following me around like big brother and the slowdown of my phone was enough to justify this option . '' The next response came from CoachLivi . She made the old , probably not true , claim that she 'll be reverting to how things used to be in the olden days , saying : `` I guess I 'll be taking numbers and sending more text messages . I 'm not downloading Messenger and I sure as hell refuse to upgrade Facebook . Have n't upgraded the app since October . The permissions required are beyond intrusive and are absolutely unnecessary . '' Which gave CWags334 the opportunity to ZING in with : `` ' ... beyond intrusive and are absolutely unnecessary ? ' Does n't that accurately describe Facebook itself ? '' On The Register , reader Nigel Whitfield questions if the average user will find anything positive about the change . He commented : `` Sometimes it seems that the people creating these apps assume that everyone uses them in the way they do ; that everyone has the latest devices with lots of storage space . With FourSquare/Swarm I honestly ca n't see the point for me ; I do n't give a toss where people are right now , because I 'm not a 20-something valley geek who hangs out at just a few places with all my mates , which seems to be the point of the new app . '' Meanwhile , reader SebWear86 published a short sci-fi story over on Cnet , describing how this move may bring about the end of Facebook altogether . He published his workings thus : `` I install Messenger . I stop using FB stream because it 's all babies and weddings . I delete FB stream . I keep using Messenger but realize my friends are on other chat systems ( ie Snapchat which has way better privacy ) . I stop using and delete Messenger . I am out of the Facebook world . I am happy : ) '' But one day you might convince someone to have a baby with you , then who are you going to show ( spam ) the photos of it to ? Will you be printing them out and waving them at strangers in the street ? Reader RetroUltraModern is of the same mind , asking : `` This is such a dumb move for Facebook . If Facebook users need to download another app for texting , they have a lot of choices . Why stick with FB Messenger when there are so many better apps out there ? '' Because mum 's only on Facebook and no one 's really as popular and sociable as they pretend to be ? On Mashable , Anthony Fulginiti is finished with the social site . He raged : `` I am officially done with Facebook . I will NOT be forced to use another application just the same that no one can force me to do anything else . '' Lee Willoughby , on the other hand , thinks this is all just your usual flash-whinge that 'll quickly blow over . He commented : `` The only objection here seems to be ' I do n't want two apps ' is that it ? Facebook Messenger is a brilliant messaging app . No one will delete their Facebook app -- this is the same reaction people have when Facebook make a profile change , a few weeks of moaning and then they just get on with it . Embrace the change . '' Not wanting two apps is a valid moan when the actual Facebook app already takes up 150MB of space on your phone . Try squeezing that and anything else of any use on an old HTC Wildfire and see how happy the process makes you .

We 've been here many times before . Something comes along wanting to be the `` next social network '' , it gains a bit of traction , a few articles pop up about all the `` buzz '' it 's causing , and then it vanishes back into the black hole of insignificance . We all go back to Facebook and Twitter and that 's the end of it . But something different is astir with Ello . The social network with the no-ad promise is picking up more hype than those before it . Kickstarted by a mass immigration of the LGBTQ community peed off by Facebook 's correct name policy , the initial groundswell has been spurred on in the last 48 hours by scores of people tweeting and Facebooking about it - and the fact you need an invite if you want access ( Exclusivity helps build hype . Always . Even for Google Wave ) . Once you 're in , Ello looks pretty familiar . It actually reminds me a lot of Chinese social network Weibo , which I became a big fan of during my time living in the country , and which similarly pulls together the timeline of Twitter with the more personal features of Facebook . It 's a clean look , but more importantly Ello promises no ads and no data mining . So how the hell is it going to keep the lights on ? Its creators promise paid-for features in the near future , which users will have the option of adding to their profiles at a small cost . It sounds like it 's going to be a freemium social network . Sure , history tells us that it 'll go the way of so many of its predecessors . But history has another lesson to teach us about : Myspace . Remember hanging out with Myspace Tom ? He still remembers you . And he still remembers how you left him on the sinking HMS HTML without a liferaft when you jumped ship for Facebook . Zuckerberg 's platform was a way of escaping those annoying Myspace changes you did n't like . But like Ello , Facebook was n't so different from what we knew when it came along . It was new , it was interesting , but it was n't exactly different . Moving away from the personalisable profiles that Myspace afforded to Facebook 's monotonous blue pages probably would n't have been predicted by most , but there you go . And the niggling resentments we had towards Myspace are starting to creep in again , now aimed at Facebook and , to a lesser extent , Twitter . Like Myspace , Facebook is not the same beast it once was : It spams our feeds with adverts more than ever ; it sells on our data to more third parties than ever . Meanwhile Twitter 's latest idea is to invade our feeds with tweets from people we do n't even follow . There has to be a breaking point . All these companies need to find ways to survive , so I 'm certainly not suggesting we deserve any of this stuff for free . But Facebook 's current model of aggressive expansion could end up costing it its appeal . I 'm fickle . So are you . We 're human . We 'll both move onto something better if it comes along , and only faster if we 're being pushed from the other direction . Because the only thing keeping us on Facebook is our friends . And when they go , we 'll go with them . So will Ello pick up or will it sink like a stone ? As I said , recent history predicts the latter . But a lot of people are interested in Ello right now and I think that says a lot . Feelings towards Facebook and Twitter have shifted in the past few years and there may soon be an opportunity for someone else to swoop in and divert our attention - there 's no reason Ello is n't that someone . Facebook and Twitter may not have to worry about any mass migration just yet , but if they continue to increasingly push adverts , sell data and spam our feeds , their days of relevance are surely numbered .

The words `` unmanned drone '' often carry a negative connotation , but Facebook plans to change all that in the next three to five years by using them to deliver internet connections in developing countries around the globe . Facebook 's ambitious plans center around delivering internet to the remaining 15 % of the world 's population who remain untethered from the world wide web . Speaking at this year 's Social Good Summit , Facebook Connectivity Lab Engineering Director Yael Maguire offered further details on how a potential fleet of unmanned planes circling the globe at up to 90,000 feet could work . Described as `` roughly the size of a commercial aircraft , like a 747 '' but much lighter , the planes ( Maguire does n't like to call them as `` drones '' ) will fly above the weather using solar power to target 21 countries in Latin America , Africa and Asia . Beyond the technical accomplishment , Maguire claims there are currently no regulatory issues for planes flying above 60,000 feet that would prevent beaming the internet to these underdeveloped parts of the world . Once in the air , the drones would have to fly unmanned for several months at a time , no small feat considering the current world record for flight endurance on a solar-powered plane is just two weeks . Maguire says Facebook hopes to get the first such aircraft into the sky in 2015 with testing to take place at an undisclosed US location . The actual wireless internet carrying drones are three to five years away at best . The question of who will actually be responsible for deploying the drones also remains unresolved , but Maguire wants to shed some of the lingering `` negative connotations '' about such planes first .

When Facebook bought Oculus VR the most skeptical among us speculated endlessly about all the ways the social network might hold virtual reality back . But contrary to our worst fears , business at Oculus has chugged along as usual , and the latest Oculus Rift prototype - Crescent Bay - is the most impressive ever . Not only has Facebook not tried to turn Oculus Rift into a News Feed machine , but it seems Menlo Park is legitimately accelerating Oculus 's efforts and helping Oculus work toward something incredible . At the 2014 Oculus Connect conference in Hollywood on September 20 , Oculus founder Palmer Luckey explained all the benefits of working with the house that Zuck built and his dreams for the future of VR . Luckey believes that there will eventually be `` a digital universe parallel to our own that is perhaps using up more of our time '' than the real world , the Rift creator told journalists during group interviews at the VR conference . And it 's Facebook 's sheer massiveness - not its expertise with platforms , or its treasure troves of user data , or anything else - that have helped Oculus develop the technology that may ultimately be integral to this `` metaverse , '' Luckey said . `` There 's only a couple of companies in the world with the infrastructure and know-how to build a platform that can have hundreds of millions or billions of people all in one virtual space , and Facebook is one of them , '' Luckey said . Thanks to Facebook 's enormous infrastructure , `` we 've been able to stop doing a lot of bullshit that you have to do when you are a growing company , '' Luckey continued . `` Things like legal , human resources , recruiting - those are all really hard to do in an organization , and to be honest we 've been focused so much on engineering that we 've not built out those teams nearly as much . Because we 're now part of Facebook , they get to deal with all that . '' Luckey discovered another benefit of working with large companies - the speed and ease with which they can get things done - when Oculus partnered with Samsung to make Gear VR . `` [ Samsung ] can have an idea and within a couple of weeks have custom components from multiple companies to make this idea possible , '' he said . `` Facebook 's given us those resources , where now we have some of that same magical superpower to move faster than we could as a little team . '' `` They also have really good food at Facebook , '' Luckey added . `` We have a big cart of candy that we did n't have before . '' Luckey said the `` metaverse '' he envisions is part of what will attract non-gamers to virtual reality . `` You do n't try to sell a non-gamer on games ; you have to make things that are compelling to them , '' he said . `` There are lots of people who would n't describe themselves as gamers who go bowling , who play checkers…and they do n't do it because they 're excited about the game , '' he continued . `` It 's because they 're excited by the people that they 're with . They 're excited by the social interactions and the connections with other people , and structured activities are just an excuse to get together with people . '' Oculus could really be onto something if that applies to virtual space as well as to real life .

Just as folks are starting to download iOS 8 today and get on line for the iPhone 6 launch on Friday , Facebook is also tidying up its smartphone apps . The social network detailed in a blog post that it 's making its Facebook app bigger and clearer to match the larger screen resolutions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus . Facebook also wrote a short walkthrough on how sharing photos from users ' libraries or webpage clippings though Safari will lead users to a sharing page with a new layout . After tapping on Facebook , the usual sharing overlay will display on the screen allowing users to pick who they want to share with , add a location , tag friends , and add a status update . In reality nothing has changed here on Facebook 's end as it seems its smartphone app does not support iOS 8 's extensibility feature , which lets apps to communicate directly with each other . The new feature allows users to share an item they see in Safari on Pintrest without ever having to leave their browser or edit their images in the photo library with Waterlogue effects . Facebook says its update will roll out to users over the coming weeks . Aside from the small UI refresh , Facebook is took the time to make it very clear that it has not changed its privacy rules regarding users ' Location Services . Users on Apple 's latest mobile OS may note that their Location Services settings have been updated with an option to be turned always on , never or just when using an app . Worried that it would be accused of tracking users ( again ) , Facebook wrote it `` does not get location information from your device in the background ( that is , while you 're not using the app ) . '' The social network went on to explain Location Services only activates when users geotag their status updates or turn on a feature that requires the service such as Nearby Friends .

Facebook is a nightmare for most large businesses . Employees routinely divulge sensitive company info and passwords are sometimes incredibly easy to hack . In between posts about new relationship milestones and pleas to support a doggy daycare charity , there are a few business posts - some useful and some that are indiscernible from spam . While you can post links to topics and generate page views for company info to a wide audience , you almost have to sacrifice your integrity to do so - or at least your business privacy . These alternatives provide a few extra security precautions like two-factor authentication to make sure your corporate data does n't fall into the wrong hands . They run only inside a company network ( or on a secure cloud platform ) for added security , provide tools for searching an entire library of employee docs and news , and encourage real productivity using work group portals over sharing pictures of the kids and an employee 's last vacation . Plus , these tools pull data in from services like Box.net or outlook to make all of the company info available through one main portal - one that does n't need much attention from the IT staff or outside Web programmers . http : //www.jivesoftware.com/ Billed as the next iteration of the corporate Intranet , Jive focuses primarily on the great missing piece of the enterprise puzzle : employee communication . In basic terms , the app lets employees search for official company information , documents , and news . For example , human resources can set up a portal for employees to get all of the document they need for expense reports . Even more important than that , Jive is designed to help employees communicate on the data held in the repositories , posting comments and questions that look and function like a public Facebook post . One key feature is the ability to connect disprarate systems within a large company - for example , helping employees find Box.net documents posts on Outlook or Evernote , and even the company customer-relationship management system through one main collaboration platform . A bonus is that the employee directory is also easy to use and fast . http : //www.socialcast.com/ Offered by the same company that makes the most popular server virtualization tech , SocialCast has the most robust features for large enterprises . At its core , the app lets office workers collaborate on projects , hold `` all hands '' meetings , and even solicit opinions for employees in a confidential way . It 's essentially a business app to foster more social and collaborative work between teams and departments . Yet , IT admins can still run regular reports on all discussions , documents , and posts to monitor for compliance . A data purge feature even helps with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance . Hosting options are quite varied - you can choose an on-premise option , hosting in the cloud , or even hosting at a secure facility in Europe . https : //www.yammer.com Yammer deserves credit for paving the way for `` next gen '' social networking for business . The private collaboration environment provides one of the best and easiest search functions - you can search for any topic or document and find it in fewer clicks . There are Yammer Groups that are focused more on a project goal or company objective than on a hierarchy . Employees with access rights to the group can then post questions and comments right alongside the top executives . An employee can even invite another to collaborate within a group . Like LinkedIn and Facebook , an employee can create a dossier of experience and skills , which is then searchable by other employees ( including those running a project and needing that skillset ) . http : //www.tibbr.com The idea of `` going social '' has a very different meaning in business . It 's not about photos of pets or babies . Often , the goal is to make sure everyone in the office knows what is going on , who is doing what , and even which skills you have to help a project success .

It 's hard to imagine that the original iPhone launched without support for third-party apps , and the iWatch reportedly wo n't have that problem . The Apple wearable is expected to debut at the same September 9 event during which the iPhone 6 will show its face , and when it does it will most likely already have support from major app makers . That 's thanks to the fact that these important entities , including Facebook and others , have already been given access to the iWatch 's software development kit , according to 9 to 5 Mac . The site spoke with two sources in the know who added that the iWatch will also have its own App Store . For now the sources could n't say whether this App Store will be a full-fledged app accessed from the iWatch itself , or simply a new section of the existing App Store . In any case it will be populated with apps from Facebook and other `` high-profile social network and services companies '' who already have iOS apps available . However these companies reportedly only gained access to the pre-release version of the iWatch SDK recently , so the apps we see on September 9 may only be early or unfinished versions , especially if the iWatch does n't launch until 2015 . As an aside this same report says Facebook is almost done with its iOS 8 app refresh , which means other developers likely are as well .
Privacy is , quite understandably , a big concern for Facebook users , and the social network is rolling out a new tool to help you sort through your options . Facebook users will begin to see the `` Privacy Checkup '' pop-up appear on their News Feeds over the next few weeks . Alternately you can access it manually through the `` privacy shortcuts '' button near your notifications on the top of the page . The process is optional , but if you choose to embark on it the Facebook Privacy Checkup will walk you through a number of steps that will help you determine exactly who can see what you post on Facebook . The new Privacy Checkup mirrors a similar feature Facebook rolled out when it was updating its privacy settings for new users back in May , and even uses the same adorable dinosaur as a sort of privacy mascot pulling the levers behind the scenes . Facebook 's privacy problems have at times been so bad that the FTC felt the need to step in . But the site appears to be taking steps to make users feel more secure when posting photos and statuses , the latest being the Privacy Checkup , which should help new and long-time Facebook users alike . The Privacy Checkup uses three steps to help you secure your Facebook feed . The first concerns users ' post settings , the second lets you review what apps you 've signed into with Facebook and their individual permissions , and the third includes privacy of various details of your profile . Facebook published a handy video explaining the Privacy Checkup and everything it does , so watch that if you want to know more before you actually get to use it yourself .

The EU is investigating whether Facebook 's big bucks purchase of the immensely popular WhatsApp is good for the public , and will decide by the beginning of next month whether it ratifies the deal . Facebook 's $ 16 billion purchase - equivalent to £9.5bn or AU $ 17.7b at the time - was announced back in February , but the deal has yet to be rubber stamped by the European Union . It could decide that the purchase holds no problem for its citizens or it could either demand concessions or launch a full review , depending on the feedback it gets from third parties who also provide messaging apps and the phone companies themselves . Reuters has seen the survey that is being sent out and it alludes to the potential antitrust problems that the EU sees - asking if the deal will lead to price increases or the deterrent of innovation and if the app could replace other services such as SMS and emails . Back in february Facebook 's Mark Zuckerberg suggested WhatsApp was the `` clear global leader '' despite big local rivals in Asian territories . He also suggested that WhatsApp would continue to operate independently and not simply be merged into Facebook 's current messaging system .

Thanks to sources familiar with the matter , we anticipated that the Oculus Rift would finally reach consumer households next summer but only in beta form and in limited quantities to gauge public interest . This seems even more likely after hearing what Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed during the company 's recent earnings call . Apparently Zuck and co. , have a long term plan set in place for the Rift headset but it will take awhile before it becomes a household name : `` It needs to reach a very large scale - 50 to 100 million units - before it will really be a very meaningful thing as a computing platform , so I do think it 's going to take a bunch of years to get there . Maybe , I do n't know - it 's hard to predict exactly - but I do n't think it 's going to get to 50 or 100 million units in the next few years , right ? That 'll take a few cycles of the device to get there . '' If ten years sounds a long time , just think about how long it took for Sony and Microsoft to create the PS4 and Xbox One . The development kits have also seen various iterations - from SDK 1 to Crystal Cove and so forth - and will likely continue to improve once the beta releases . But again , virtual reality is still a fresh space and you wo n't see the 100 million units just yet . Zuck further elaborates his vision : `` And when you get to that scale , that 's when it starts to be interesting as a business , in terms of developing out of the ecosystem . So when I 'm talking about it as a 10-year thing , I 'm talking about building the first set of devices , and then building the audience and the ecosystem around that , until it eventually becomes a business . '' The in-house Oculus game dev team is probably helping accelerate the pace , and the funding provided by Facebook may explain the impending beta . There are plenty of other VR fish in the sea , but right now Zuck states , `` It 's still early for Oculus . '' Via Gamasutra

Facebook has aimed to become the center of all internet conversations and its latest ploy to accomplish this goal is a new app called Rooms . The Rooms app aspires to recreate the chat rooms and forum discussion boards of internet yore in which a community of like-minded users could talk about subjects through the anonymity of the web . Rooms not only allows users to take on a pseudonym , it also does n't require users to log in with their Facebook account or even an email address . Once in the app , users can create discussion rooms dedicated to any topic , whether it 's sharing photos of home cooked meals , parkour videos or the finer points of beat boxing.Through these rooms , users can communicate with photos , videos and text . If you 're the owner of the room you can also customize the feel the room by adding a cover photo as well as changing the colors and text of the discussion board . Taking a page out of forums , the room administrator can also pin posts and assign users as moderators . Joining a room , however , is slightly more complicated as invites are shared through a QR code . Unless the room has been set to public , the only way to join is to take a snapshot of the QR code invitation or if the owner sends you an invite message . Rooms can also automatically access the iOS camera roll for unscanned QR codes and sign you into the corresponding rooms . The team at Branch developed the Rooms app in Facebook 's Creative Labs program after the social network acquired the company in January . Branch 's Josh Miller explained in a blog post he wanted to create a new internet space that allows everyone be whoever they want to be . `` It does n't matter where you live , what you look like or how old you are - all of us are the same size and shape online , '' Miller wrote . `` From unique obsessions and unconventional hobbies , to personal finance and health-related issues - you can celebrate the sides of yourself that you do n't always show to your friends , '' Miller expounded in the same blog post . Rooms is an interesting new development from Facebook as the app exists completely outside of the social network . Trending topics has n't produced the intense community discussion in the same way as hashtags on Twitter , so Rooms appears to be a new strategy to creating user interaction . Rooms is available for iOS in the App Store , though there are reports the app has become unavailable . We at TechRadar had problems downloading it , too .

We 've all been there . Someone posts an update on Facebook , you ca n't think of anything meaningful to write beneath it , but just 'liking ' it would convey a very different message to `` I 'm so sorry to hear this sad news . '' If only there were a 'dislike ' button . It 's something that 's come up time and time again , and interestingly it was actually a hot topic during the creation of the Facebook 'like ' . We know because the creator of the 'like ' and ex-Facebook CTO Bret Taylor ( currently CEO of mobile productivity app Quip ) , told us himself . But he also explained why there never was one , and probably never will be one : it 's just far too complex . `` [ The dislike button ] came up a lot . In fact even the language of the word like was something we discussed a lot as well . But regarding the dislike button , the main reason is that in the context of the social network , the negativity of that button has a lot of unfortunate consequences . '' `` The reason we launched the button in the first place was that there were a lot of times that people wanted to acknowledge something someone did , but did n't have anything to say . And a lot of comments were one word like 'cool ' or 'wow ' so the like button let people did that with a single click . It was n't really just a sentiment of 'like ' . '' But a 'dislike ' button would n't work in the same way , said Taylor , and would only bring a lot of negativity with it instead . There could be implications on cyber bullying , for example . `` I have the feeling that if there were to be a 'dislike ' button is that you would end up with these really negative social aspects to it . If you want to dislike something , you should probably write a comment , because there 's probably a word for what you want to say . `` I 'm not saying the 'like ' button is n't flawed would it be even more complex with a negative sentiment like 'dislike ' . '' It 's also worth mentioning that a 'dislike ' button would n't be as useful as the 'like ' for Facebook 's targeted advertising , but that 's just us being slightly cynical .

Facebook 's security department has begun monitoring the news for mass password leaks using an automated process that will help the company alert its users when their data has been compromised . Given all the security mishaps that have surprised users lately , this precaution is probably a good idea . Facebook 's process scans the news and monitors websites like pastebin , where hackers sometimes distribute leaked credentials , Facebook Security Engineer Chris Long wrote in a blog post . When Facebook discovers a breach has occurred , the process automatically compares the leaked data to its own ( encrypted and/or hashed ) databases . When it finds matches , Facebook alerts the users whose data was accessed and walks them through changing their passwords . Long wrote that Facebook has actually been doing this since Adobe was hacked back in 2013 , but it 's only just now made it an official and permanent process . Even so , Facebook users ( and everyone else on the internet ) would be wise to enable two-step authentication wherever possible .

App development can be slow going sometimes , which might explain why goliaths like Twitter , Facebook and Microsoft are only now getting their iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus updates pushed out . In any case the Facebook , Twitter and Skype iOS apps are now equipped to deal with these handsets ' larger screens . The updates bring Facebook up to version 16 and Twitter up to version 6.15.1 , and these apps ' descriptions now note that they 're `` optimized '' for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus . Skype , too , now lists iPhone 6 optimization with version 5.6 . Naturally these updates are available free in the App Store . The Skype app 's `` what 's new '' section now notes a number of minor changes to how things are displayed , as well as improvements to `` do not disturb '' mode and the ability to mark conversations as `` read '' or `` unread . '' Skype Product Marketing Manager Lara Kingwell also wrote in a Skype blog post that the new app 's iPhone 6-optimized resolutions display more recent chats and more messages in conversation view as well . Google updated its own Chrome and Gmail apps for the bigger iPhone 6 screens earlier this month . Are there any apps left that still look wonky on the new iPhones ' screens ? Hopefully they 'll be addressed soon too . Via Phone Scoop

Some see stickers as a welcome way to add some personality to their Facebook comments , while others view them as a full-fledged epidemic . If you 're in the later camp , there 's already a new weapon for your arsenal : Unsticker.me . The browser extension for both Firefox and Chrome and will replace Facebook stickers you might normally see with the word `` sticker '' in brackets . Unsticker.me creator and Pinterest software engineering intern Rodney Folz tweeted that he hates both Facebook stickers and fun in general . `` If you hate stickers and fun , download this addon , '' he wrote on its official page . Luckily ( or not ? ) it at least leaves stickers intact in Facebook chats and messages .
Facebook made like it 's 1994 when it introduced stickers ( read : emoticons ) in Messenger chats , and now it 's making like 1995 by expanding their role on the site . Facebook users can now add stickers to comments , which is bad news for any who 'd rather just communicate with words . Facebook 's available stickers are invariably adorable and generally range from cute animals doing cute things to other cute animals doing even cuter things . There are licensed stickers from shows like Adventure Time and Power Rangers as well . From the sticker menu , you can browse available sticker packs , all of which are free - for now at least . We 've asked Facebook whether it has any plans to begin charging for sticker packs , and we 'll update here if we hear back . It would be surprising if the answer is anything other than `` yes , '' unless that answer is `` no comment , '' which seems more likely . The continued popularity of emoticons on the web , in texts and basically anywhere else where they 're available proves that if they are available , people will use them . Thankfully you can currently only post stickers in comments on existing posts , and not in new posts or statuses . Just recall that there was once a time when Facebook was considered the more professional and mature option compared with Myspace and other competitors . What is it turning into now ?

The content discovery platform StumbleUpon has updated its iOS app with new social features that let users share content and message one another within the app itself . Previously StumbleUpon users could message links to others via SMS , but the new messaging feature keeps you in the app while still letting you chat with friends about content you discover . Your friends are represented in StumbleUpon with round profile photos not unlike Facebook 's annoying Chat Heads . The StumbleUpon app also has a new `` activity center '' that tracks your friends ' recent shares and your notifications - not unlike , say , Facebook 's News Feed . The new StumbleUpon app also has various other improvements like performance boosts and a new UI , as well as support for custom lists . StumbleUpon has been used by many for years to discover new content , usually when users are wracked by boredom . It 's notable that the company is currently independent , having been purchased by eBay but promptly resold to and relaunched by its original owners in 2009 . Via TechCrunch

With Facebook spending almost $ 22 billion ( about £13.6b , AU $ 25b ) on WhatsApp you 'd think the social network would have some idea what it wants to do with the messaging service . On the contrary , though , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has revealed that he has no immediate plans for the company 's latest acquisition , reports Reuters . Zuckerberg admitted at an event in India that he `` has no near-term plan to make money from the service , '' the site says . TechRadar has previously posed the very question that Zuckerberg may be asking himself right at this moment : why did Facebook buy WhatsApp ? There is no obvious answer , particularly since WhatsApp does n't have a clear path to monetization - the service only charges $ 1 in yearly subscription fees , and that fee is waived during each user 's first year . No doubt Facebook has entire campuses full of interns working on this problem , but for now it seems WhatsApp , like previous Facebook conquest Oculus , will be left to its own devices .

Facebook is working on a new mobile app that will allow people to interact without having to use their real names . According to sources close to the project who spoke to the New York Times on condition of ( quite ironically ) anonymity , the app moves away from Facebook 's encouragement of its users to share as much real information about themselves as possible . Instead the app is designed to allow Facebook users to use multiple pseudonyms to discuss topics that they might not be comfortable talking about while using their real names . The project is being led by Josh Miller , who joined Facebook when it acquired Branch for $ 15 million . Branch is a platform for hosting and participating in private invite only conversations , and it is thought that Facebook 's new app could be an extension of this . The app could also be taking a leafy from message boards and online communities such as Reddit which allow users to post subjects and participate in discussions using anonymous user names . Exact details on the new app are scarce , and neither Facebook nor Miller would comment on the leaks . We still do n't know how the app will integrate with Facebook ( if at all ) , or if users will also be able to post photos and images anonymously . There will be a lot of people watching how Facebook handles anonymous posting , with the social networking site already under scrutiny for how it can protect its users from online bullying and abuse . And of course , there is a worry that allowing people to post anonymously behind a user name may encourage online harassment . It 's clear that Facebook is aware of these concerns , with Chris Cox , the chief product officer for Facebook , writing in a blog post that `` The stories of mass impersonation , trolling , domestic abuse , and higher rates of bullying and intolerance are oftentimes the result of people hiding behind fake names , and it 's both terrifying and sad '' .

WhatsApp user ? Your favourite chat app is now officially the property of Facebook , which completed its aquisition today . Facebook announced in February that it would be snapping up WhatsApp for a cool $ 19 billion , and today it officially closed the deal with the SEC , just hours after it was given the go-ahead by the European Commission . That sum has been pushed up to $ 21.8 billion , but as Recode points out , that 's due to Facebook 's stock rising over the last few months . With the deal now official WhatsApp founder Jan Koum has joined the Facebook board , though the specifics of his role are currently unknown . We 're all curious to see if and how Facebook will play around with WhatsApp , but we expect it wo n't meddle much for the time being . Zuckerberg promised that , as with Oculus , WhatsApp will continue to operate largely independently .
Facebook is set to introduce a friend-to-friend payment system to Messenger , according to some newly leaked screenshots . Rumours of a move into mobile payments have been circling around Facebook for a while , and now some new images show off a new feature that 'll allow you send money to a friend in just a couple of clicks , after registering a debit card and setting up a pin code . TechCrunch obtained the pictures from a computer science student , and even a screenshot of the feature in action . According to the source who unearthed the information , all Facebook has to do at this point is switch the feature on . Payments will be limited between two people for the time being , but a note in the code explains `` Multiple payment attachments will be supported in the future . '' It 's not clear if Facebook intends to charge users a small fee for the service , but the source calculated that each transaction would cost Facebook between $ 40 and $ 50 . At this point , it 's probably worth pointing out that the company recently appointed ex-PayPal president David Marcus as the head of its Messenger app . That obviously makes a lot more sense now . Back in July , Zuckerberg told investors that Facebook was n't planning to roll out mobile payments any time soon , but this week 's new information suggests otherwise . And with Facebook testing out a buy button for ecommerce purchases , the timing feels right . We 've approached Facebook for comment on the matter , though we expect it 'll be keeping schtum for now .

It 's been months and months since Facebook bought WhatsApp for $ 19 billion ( about £9.5b , AU $ 17.7b ) , and the European Union has finally signed off on the deal . EU regulators revealed in September that they were investigating the acquisition for potential antitrust violations . That investigation included surveys sent out asking Facebook and WhatsApp competitors asking whether the deal will lead to raised prices or deter innovation . But today the EU gave the deal a great , big `` OK '' gesture , curling its collective index fingers and thumbs into the shape of a circle and holding them up for all to see , reports Reuters . `` We have carefully reviewed this proposed acquisition and come to the conclusion that it would not hamper competition in this dynamic and growing market , '' European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement . `` Consumers will continue to have a wide choice of consumer communications apps . '' WhatsApp is reportedly poised to add voice calling to its messaging service , but nevertheless the EU found its merger with Facebook poses no threat to competition . The deal is good for WhatsApp , though , which experienced a surge of 500 million new users in the immediate aftermath of Facebook 's purchase . And no doubt Facebook sees something in the service as well - even for the largest social network in the world $ 19 billion ai n't exactly chump change .
Facebook has already conquered social media , and its other ongoing conquests range from virtual reality to messaging . But the social network may be about to embark on a new frontier : healthcare . Facebook 's health initiative will be twofold , three separate sources told Reuters . One part could take shape as online `` support communities '' where people could congregate and discuss their ailments , while Facebook is also reportedly considering building a `` preventative care '' lifestyle improvement app . Facebook will begin rolling these apps out quietly and under different names because of the stigma surrounding Facebook 's various privacy policies , a source told the site . That 's pretty ironic considering the company 's tumultuous relationship with its own users ' anonymity . This all may have begun when Facebook changed its profiles in 2012 to include users ' organ donor status , a move that reportedly resulted in more people than usual registering to become organ donors . Facebook also apparently noticed a trend in people with certain conditions and illnesses regularly searching the social network for information . Some users will no doubt be uncomfortable sharing such personal information online , so it 's a good thing Facebook is also changing its real name policy .

Facebook has really been in hot water lately . The social network already apologized once this week for alienating the LGBT community with its bullheaded real name policy . Now the house that Zuck built is serving crow for dinner once again , this time over the News Feed fiddling the company revealed back in June . Facebook had been messing with people 's News Feeds to examine how its users react to different types of posts , an act that Facebook Chief Technical Officer Mike Schroepfer has now ( more or less ) apologized for . The issue for many Facebook users is that they had never consciously agreed to be the subject of such an experiment , even if it was relatively harmless . `` It is clear now that there are things we should have done differently , '' Schroepfer wrote in Facebook 's Newsroom . `` For example , we should have considered other non-experimental ways to do this research . The research would also have benefited from more extensive review by a wider and more senior group of people . Last , in releasing the study , we failed to communicate clearly why and how we did it . '' He outlined Facebook 's new research policies , which include clearer guidelines for researchers , more extensive research project reviews , more training for Facebook employees , and a public-facing research website . `` We 're committed to doing research to make Facebook better , but we want to do it in the most responsible way , '' Schroepfer wrote . Facebook may be on the right track , unless this is an experiment too . Now if only they 'd put Messenger back where it belongs .

Between its forced separation of Facebook Messenger from the rest of the app and its bullheaded alienation of the LGBT community , Facebook has n't made many friends the past few months . But now it seems the social network wants to remedy that . No , unfortunately they 're not stitching Messenger back into the main Facebook app . Even better , though , the social network has agreed to be more lenient when it comes to its real name policy . This concession also came with an apology to the LGBT community , proving Facebook knows when it has to eat a little crow . The trouble for Facebook may have really begun when some users , particularly LGBT users whose accounts had been suspended over Facebook 's `` real name '' policy , began migrating to Ello . Facebook did n't do itself any favors when it refused to budge initially , but according to Facebook Vice President of Product Chris Cox the company has rethought its position . `` I want to apologize to the affected community of drag queens , drag kings , transgender , and extensive community of our friends , neighbors , and members of the LGBT community for the hardship that we 've put you through in dealing with your Facebook accounts over the past few weeks , '' Cox wrote in a Facebook post . `` We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook , and we 're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were , '' he continued . Cox also revealed that most of the LGBT users who were reported for not using their real names were targeted by a single vigilante user , and unfortunately Facebook did n't notice the pattern at first . He said Facebook stands by its real name policy , but that it 's never been about making people use their actual , legal names . Now they 're `` building better tools '' for dealing with real name reports while ensuring individuals can use the names they use in real life , regardless of their actual legal names , and providing `` more deliberate customer service '' to flagged accounts .

The UK Government 's Science and Technology Committee has warned social media websites that their terms and conditions are too labyrinthine , and therefore not fit for demonstrating that users have given informed consent of how the companies use their data . The committee is pushing for the Government to work with the Information Commissioner to set up a number of information standards for websites and apps to sign up to . This would mean social media websites and apps would be committed to explain how they use personal data in clear , concise and simple terns . We 've all been there . We 've signed up for a website , or downloaded an app , and been confronted by a long and confusing terms and conditions document . Rather than having to read through the wall of jargon we skip to the end and click 'Agree ' . Unfortunately this often means we 're agreeing to websites and apps accessing information that we might not want them to . The UK government may now be looking at ways to force companies to be more transparent about the data they collect from their users , along with how they use it . At the moment the rules will be voluntary , but if needed the Government might be forced to enshrine them in law . But will companies sign up for these new rules ? Science and Technology Committee Chair , Andrew Miller MP thinks they will . He said : `` Socially responsible companies would n't want to bamboozle their users , of course , so we are sure most social media developers will be happy to sign up to the new guidelines on clear communication and informed consent that we are asking the Government to draw up .

Facebook is gradually turning features of its mobile service into standalone apps . Both Messenger and Paper got the app treatment , and now Groups is getting the same . As its name suggests , Groups lets you interact specifically with the Facebook groups you 're a part of . By putting this feature into its own app , Facebook hopes that it 'll make managing and navigating these groups a bit easier . Right now you can access Groups from within the main Facebook app , but the feature is somewhat hidden away among all the other bits and pieces of the social network 's mobile application . The Groups app makes things much clearer , presenting your groups in attractive circular icons , with your most frequently-visited positioned at the top . However , if you 're a regular user of Groups but do n't fancy adding yet another app to your phone screen , the good news is that Facebook wo n't be forcing you to move over to the iOS/Android app . You 've got the option to keep using Groups from within the main app - at least for the foreseeable future .

We can probably all agree that there are too many promotional posts clogging up our Facebook News Feeds these days , but the big blue social network is finally stepping in to take action . Facebook has announced that it plans to reduce the amount of promotional posts appearing on our feeds , in light of results from a mass user survey . `` People told us they wanted to see more stories from friends and Pages they care about , and less promotional content , '' said Facebook in a blog post . According to Facebook 's findings , people generally get more annoyed with promotional posts from pages they 've 'liked ' than actual adverts . In particular , users get miffed with posts that `` solely push people to buy a product or install an app '' , posts that push them to enter promotions and sweepstakes `` with no real context '' , and posts that lazily reuse the same content from ads . Facebook went on to add that it will be introducing `` new volume and content controls '' for promotional posts , allowing us to see more baby photos and holiday brags , and less of the commercial rubbish . Facebook also says that these new changes wo n't lead to an increase in adverts on the News Feed . Zuck 's social network uses different regulatory controls for ads than it does for promotional Page posts , the latter of which , it admits , have n't been monitored as closely as the former . The changes will kick in starting January 2015 , and Facebook has gently warned Page owners that violate the standards will see their reach `` fall significantly over time '' . You 've been warned .
Facebook is looking to diversify outside its traditional consumer market and sees the workplace as the next area of growth . And it is likely to happen sooner rather than later according to a report published by the Financial Times . The article does n't mention any specifics other than the fact that `` Facebook at Work '' will be an enterprise-focused offering a classic set of features found in similar collaborative solutions . This includes a newsfeed , groups , messaging and since the FT article also mentions Google Drive specifically , possibly file sharing and document editing as well . That service will be separate from a user 's personal account , with no data transiting between the two . An early pilot is already running in London and while it does n't include advertising for now , it will be interesting to see whether it does so in the future , especially if it offers a paid-for option . Facebook 's market capitalisation currently stands at $ 209bn while that of LinkedIn tops $ 29bn , which makes Facebook users far more valuable than LinkedIn 's professionals .

Facebook made a lot of noise about a tweaking of its terms and conditions this week , making the language a little simpler and answering troublesome modern questions like `` How can I stop someone who 's bothering me ? '' in its FAQ . One of the changes it seems happiest about introducing to more parts of the world is the ability to have advert preferences synced on a cross-platform basis , meaning if you 've told the phone app to stop showing you a certain type of advert , that choice will now be reflected on the desktop site too . Which means one type of advert will be replaced with another type of advert . Hooray for our innovative ad-serving overlords . The level of empowerment we have right now is insane . We doubt if manually clicking on adverts every time you open the app will eventually mean you `` complete '' the advertising game , though . Turn off teeth-whitening and it 'll be replaced by motivational fitness instead . Opt out of that and it 'll be baldness cures . The advertising game is infinite and procedurally generated . Choose anything but the ad you 're currently looking at and you 'll be served whatever ads are part of the next lowest common denominator , money-making arbitrage scheme someone 's foolishly pumping their pension pot into . It 's doubly annoying because it 's obvious that Facebook actually likes us switching off adverts . The fact that one ad annoys us so much we turn it off is counted as invaluable customer feedback , as we are at least `` engaging '' with the served media on some level , even if all we 're doing is saying `` MAKE IT STOP I HATE THOSE KINDS OF CRISPS . '' The more we tell Facebook what we do n't like , the more data it 'll generate about what we do like . Once you 've told it all the things you do n't like , what remains , no matter how implausible , must be what you really like seeing adverts about . You ca n't spite it . You ca n't beat the algorithm . It 's like the playground bully who answers every question with a stupid reply for which there is no response . `` I hate adverts about online gaming , '' you say . `` I know you do so there , '' replies the algorithm , serving you adverts about German-engineered hair-thickening shampoo instead . `` My hair is thick and healthy as illustrated by the above-angled photo uploaded on October 17th , '' you say . `` I know you do so there , '' replies the algorithm , serving you adverts for vegetable steamers based on the fact your chin looked a bit wobbly in the photo uploaded on October 21st . The more we click , the more it knows . The more it wins . If 500 people say they hate the new Pot Noodle advert because it 's offensive even though we know it 's trying to be ironic , the negative feedback gives some suit at Facebook UK enough reason to schedule a meeting with Unilever to talk about engagement levels and ask them for a few extra pence per 1,000 views for the next one . You click , it wins again . The only way to fight it , as with all omnipresent , unbeatable , irrational internet trolls , is to not respond . Let it serve you irrelevant advertising . Let it wash over you . Sigh and laugh if it tries to sell you imaginary coins for use in a game you do n't play . Occasionally misdirect it by clicking on an advert for Norwegian cruise holidays , even though you left the house once in 2012 and have promised never to do it again . Do n't tell it your name , real date of birth or whether or not you hate adverts for mature dating sites . It 's the only form of protest we have left .

Facebook has once again tried to simplify its privacy policy , which at 5,830 words is now officially shorter than the US Constitution . By condensing its terms of use , Facebook hopes to make it easier for the average user to understand how their data is being used by the social network . But while it might be a little clearer on how to control what other users see , you still have no control over the information Facebook sees about you . Facebook still has the right to use all your shared information to target you with ads , and what 's more , the policy actually encourages users to add as many preferences as possible so as to make for better targeted advertising . Facebook is also honing location-based advertising . In a blog post , Facebook 's Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan said , `` We 're working on ways to show you the most relevant information based on where you are and what your friends are up to . For example , in the future , if you decide to share where you are , you might see menus from restaurants nearby or updates from friends in the area . '' Such is the age of the internet that a lot of people do n't care about companies like Facebook using so much of their data for advertising , but for the more privacy-aware , the new policy is worth a read . Especially with points such as following : `` We receive information about you and your activities on and off Facebook from third-party partners , such as information from a partner when we jointly offer services or from an advertiser about your experiences or interactions with them . '' To coincide with the policy revamp , Facebook launched a new feature called Privacy Basics , which explains what other people can see about you , what you can see , and how other people can interact with you . You can see it for yourself here .

Update : Just for fun , let 's preface this article with a statistic that Facebook released today regarding Messenger usage . You see , as unhappy as the masses seem to be about the forced migration to Facebook Messenger , they 're apparently using it anyway , as Facebook reports the app now has 500 million active monthly users . `` This is an exciting milestone but with a half billion people relying on Messenger to communicate and connect , it is also a reminder that there is so much left for us to do , '' Facebook Director of Product Management Peter Martinazzi wrote on Facebook 's newsroom site . We wo n't argue with that . Original story below… Mark Zuckerberg recently completed a public Q & A and - amid fielding questions about his choice of T-shirt and David Fincher 's The Social Network - explained the forced installation of Facebook Messenger . He told the assembled crowd that the primary purpose of the Facebook app is the newsfeed , but that the company was noticing more and more usage of the direct messaging feature . According to Zuckerberg , the experience of using the main Facebook app to send messages created too much friction when compared to dedicated messaging services like iMessage or Whatsapp . `` Even though it was a short term , painful thing to ask folks to install a separate messaging app , we knew that we could never deilver the quality of experience as just a tab inside the main Facebook app . '' Zuckerberg moved on to explain the forced adoption principle by saying that Facebook 's goal was to create something for the entire community . `` We 're trying to build a service that 's good for everyone . Because Messenger is faster and more focused , if you 're using it , you respond to messages faster , '' he said . Okay , skirting the issue a bit there , Zuck . But then when you 're dealing with 10 billion messages every day , you 're never going to be able to please everyone . Facebook Messenger is free , but the app still carries plenty of negative reviews from users unhappy about being forced to download it . What do you think about Facebook 's decision to force you into using a separate messaging app ? Let us know in the comments box below .
Facebook has made a small change to its news feed , allowing you to quickly unfollow any pages , people or groups that no longer interest you . News feed settings will now show you the top pages , people and groups that have appeared on your feed over the last week . It 'll allow you to sort them by posts - or see an overall summary of your activity . From there , you can tap the arrow in the corner and choose to hide any post causing your eyeballs offence . Once you 've hidden the story , Facebook will ask you if you want to see less from that person or group , and if you do , ask if you want to unfollow them completely . All the people and groups you 've unfollowed will be stored in your settings so you can re-follow them at any time , should you so wish . The new feature is available on the desktop and mobile sites , and will come to the Facebook app in the coming weeks .

Governments continue to ask for more and more private user data from social networks , Facebook 's third government requests report reveals . The report covers not only government requests for data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and via National Security Letters , but also governments ' requests for Facebook to remove users ' content from the site . Facebook says these requests increased globally by 24 % from the last half of 2013 to the first half of 2014 . And in the same period , Facebook says , there was a 19 % increase in the amount of content restricted by local laws around the world . During the past year Facebook received its largest request ever when a New York court demanded extensive data on almost 400 users , which Facebook is fighting back against , as it says it does whenever possible . `` We scrutinize every government request we receive for legal sufficiency under our terms and the strict letter of the law , and push back hard when we find deficiencies or are served with overly broad requests , '' Facebook Deputy General Counsel Chris Sonderby wrote in a summary of this latest report . Sonderby added that Facebook continues to support legislation in the US like the USA FREEDOM Act and updates to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act that would make the government more accountable for its requests .

After resurrecting the once-annual F8 developer conference in early 2014 , Facebook has announced it 's expanding the event for a two-day extravaganza next March . The 2015 F8 Facebook conference will mark the first time the event has gone longer than one day . `` Facebook 's developer community is bigger today than it ever has been , '' reads an announcement Facebook sent out today . `` The scope of the company 's products has broadened , and there 's more content to share than can fit into a single day . The additional day means double the number of technical sessions , product demos , and onsite experiences for Facebook 's growing developer community. `` The announcement said registration details will be sent out in early 2015 , but for now you can mark your calendar and create a Facebook event for March 25 and 26 .

Facebook users have for years been asking for a `` dislike '' button to complement the site 's ability to `` like '' posts , photos and pages , and the company is n't deaf to these requests . During a Q & A at U.C . Davis Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook is `` thinking '' about how it might give users what they want while not providing them with a tool for abject negativity , Venturebeat reports . If they did add this feature , they 'd make sure it `` ends up being a force for good , '' Zuckerberg said . `` The like button is valuable because it 's a quick way to share a positive sentiment , '' Zuckerberg said . `` Some people have asked for a dislike button so they can say something is n't good , and we 're not going to do that . I do n't think that 's good for the community . '' But he said he recognizes that some posts are not appropriate to be `` liked , '' and `` we 've talked about for a while how can people express a wider range of emotions . '' Facebook already lets you comment with stickers , but there 's another solution that some Facebook users apparently have n't thought of : actually using words when clicking a button on the internet is n't good enough .

You may forget the events of a good night out , but the internet does n't . And while those 3am photos may have seemed like a good idea at the time , you might later regret having them shared with the world on Facebook . But the social media giant is looking at ways to save you the awkwardness of your Mum seeing these pictures the next day . Yann LeCun , the man behind Facebook 's Artificial Intellifence Research lab , is set to work on an innovative form of AI that can recognise the difference between your face when drunk and sober . The online assistant will give Facebook users an option to think twice before they post a photo they may later regret . LeCun is hoping to develop a form of online assistant that will give Facebook 's well-oiled users an option to think twice before they post a photo they may later regret . However , not settling for saving the world from various forms of online awkwardness , LeCun is also working on a form of AI that will completely revolutionise the online experience of the social media site . Working with a form of `` deep-learning '' , the new AI is being developed as a way to automate online tasks by imitating neuron network functions in the human brain . Speaking to Wired , LeCun said , `` Imagine that you had an intelligent digital assistant which would mediate your interaction with your friends and also with content on Facebook . '' Facebook will soon start to learn from what you post online and will start to tailor content towards your specific interests . So while there 's nobody who has yet developed a form of AI to ask you whether you 're sure about devouring that 2am kebab , it does look like Facebook will soon stop you from posting photos your parents would n't approve of .

Facebook hinted that Graph Search would arrive on mobile almost a full year ago , in January 2014 , and now it finally has - at least on iOS . The feature is also gaining some new functionality : the ability to search for specific posts . Facebook Graph Search is a relatively complex tool for searching Facebook that was introduced in 2013 . It lets users enter specific search terms like `` my friends who live in San Francisco '' or `` photos of my family . '' Until this update , however , Facebook Graph Search could not search through the text of individual posts . Now when you type in someone 's name Graph Search presents you with suggestions that relate to past posts , like `` Jessica wedding '' or `` Rousseau graduation dance . '' Facebook Search Product Manager Rousseau Kazi told The Verge that `` stronger , better , faster mobile search '' is `` a company priority . '' You can still only search posts that are available to you to begin with - like your own posts and those of your friends - so privacy settings remain even while older posts become more accessible . The new Facebook Graph Search rolls out to desktop and Facebook 's iOS app this week , and Android and other platforms - like Facebook 's mobile web app - will follow at a later date .

Here are a few astounding social photo statistics : There have been more than 250 billion photos uploaded to Facebook , with an average 350 million photo uploads every day . The average user has 217 photos uploaded to the site . And that 's just Facebook ; Zuckerberg 's $ 1 billion acquisition , Instagram , has a ridiculous 55 million snapshots posted to its app per day ( for those doing the math , that 's more than 600 shots per second ) . So what do all these uploads say about us , besides the fact that we all love a good selfie ? Recent survey results reveal that when given the choice , 74 percent of respondents would save their personal photos before the device ( phone , laptop , or tablet ) on which they 're stored . In fact , of all the files kept on their devices , consumers overwhelmingly said that their personal photos are the most important . Photo albums are things of the past ; new pictures head straight to the dust-free pages of social networks . But something much more profound and far-reaching is taking place : when we share photos on cloud-based social media , we 're actually creating a second copy of that information – a shared copy often now owned by someone else – even if that 's not the main intent . We 're calling this the `` Facebook Conditioning Effect '' – the idea that social media is making the act of backing up more a part of our consciousness . The issue is that the image we see on social media is often a low quality copy of our pictures , even if we 're unaware of this fact . And , the ironic part is that even though our selfies and food photos are stored in a second location , many of our much more important documents are left vulnerable . The good news is that the action of uploading and saving a copy of those digital files to an additional location is beginning to condition us to back up and protect more of our data overall . Why should n't we be thinking this way ? With recent advances in cloud technologies and user experiences , backing up data is now as simple as pressing `` upload . '' That 's how it works with Instagram , right ? But so much of our personal information – the really personal stuff – is n't backed up properly , safely and securely . Why is n't all of our data , not just a few of our personal photos stored safe and sound somewhere out in the digital universe ? What 's stopping this effect from making the jump from a social trend to a healthy all-encompassing data habit , where everything is backed up and protected ? The easy answer would be that there is no Facebook for say , your taxes . Startups are making enormous strides in creating data storage systems that feature the easy-to-use and easy-to-access formatting of social media sites , yet the two largest combined have less than 20 percent of Facebook 's user numbers . So if it 's not an issue of simplicity , what 's really keeping The Facebook Conditioning Effect from fully transforming our digital behaviors ? Even though we 've become much more likely to save noncritical files in the cloud , many of us have n't backed up our entire digital lives due to a number of recent high-profile data breach cases which have highlighted our chief concern : our data is n't safe when it 's not handled directly by us . Snapchat was hacked and suddenly millions of phone numbers were public . Target 's much-ballyhooed breach put the personal information of 70 million individuals at risk . So while we continue to upload every adorable puppy pic we snap , we hide away what 's really important - our work documents , banking information , health records , and other personal and professional information – into old-school file cabinets and documents marked `` personal '' on our desktops . The key is identifying and separating the issue of `` data privacy '' from the idea of `` data protection . '' While data privacy focuses more on the legal and security issues regarding data use and storage , data protection is about safeguarding that information after it has been created and stored . All Web-enabled device users should be more aware and on-alert when it comes to data privacy such as carefully reading all privacy agreements on sites and apps , and only sharing information that would n't jeopardize anything if leaked , but not at the expense of data protection . When it comes to protecting data , the safest way is to store it in multiple , secure locations . Just as our photos now live both in our devices and on Facebook , keeping important personal information multiple places ( i.e . a hard drive and the cloud , a backup drive , etc . ) should come as second nature . To make it simple , just think of the 3-2-1 rule : keep three copies of valuable data on two different types of media , and one copy at a remote location . Remember though , while basic cloud storage tools are a good starting point , they 're not foolproof when it comes to security , so finding the right balance of security and simplicity is a key part of the process . World Backup Day was on March 31 , 2014 , and it was a time for all of us to think about what we 're really putting at risk by not backing up our data . Disasters natural and manmade – from water damage due to everything from massive floods to spilled drinks , and fried drives from everyday dangers including sun exposure and destructive malware , occur daily and can put all of our information at risk . If there 's one useful thing the 351 minutes we each spend on average on Facebook per month can teach us , it 's why not spend just one minute to protect our data by keeping extra copies and backing up , not just March 31st but every day .

Joyous news from the Facebook front today as the social network announces its plans to serve up even more auto-play video ads . The last we heard was that Facebook intended to cover our News Feeds in even more video ads earlier this year , but now it seems that was n't enough . The latest announcement is that Facebook will start nestling these auto-playing videos inside another certain type of ad that prompts users to download apps directly from their News Feeds . These `` app install ads '' have been around for a while , but until now they 've been separate from the auto-playing video ads that appear elsewhere on the social network . `` As more and more people upload , share and discover video on Facebook , marketers are realizing the value of video at every stage of the buying cycle , from awareness to conversion , '' Facebook said today . Great .

For a lot of Facebook users logging on and checking the News Feed has become less about catching up with friends than about being bombarded with low quality posts that make outlandish claims in the hopes poor suckers will click on them . Now Facebook is doing something about it : reducing the distribution of these posts and adding an annotation to posts that have been flagged by users as hoaxes . Facebook Software Engineer Erich Owens and Research Scientist Udi Weinsberg note in the site 's announcement that they 're not removing the stories and that the company itself does not review posts ' contents for accuracy . But by flagging offending posts as false Facebook users can start to weed out the trash clogging up their News Feeds and get back to what the social network is supposed to be about : connecting with friends and loved ones through technology . `` The goal of News Feed is to catch up with your friends and find the things that matter to you , '' the announcement reads . `` We 're always looking to people on Facebook to tell us how we can improve this experience .

Facebook is testing a new feature for its Messenger app that will let you turn sound clips into text messages . The new feature will let you send voice messages to your contacts in Messenger , with the transcribed text displayed below . According to David Marcus , Vice President of Messaging Products at Facebook , the new feature will be rolled out to a select few users for testing and if successful will be made available for all Facebook Messenger users . `` Our plan is to test this feature at a tiny scale for now and we 're looking forward to seeing what you think of it before making the experience more widely available . '' Although being able to send sound clips via Facebook Messenger has been a feature for some time , automatic transcribing could prove to be an exciting addition . Its productivity potential could also help with Facebook 's ambitions to be used professionally by people at work .

Facebook has finally unveiled Facebook at work , a new product aimed squarely at enterprises and businesses who want to use the opportunities of social networking to improve communication and efficiency . The new initiative comes in a crowded market with Microsoft 's Yammer ( and Delve ) , Podio , Huddle , Salesforce 's Chatter and many others looking to infuse entreprise collaboration with a dose of social . The service allows companies to create their own social networks internally using Facebook technology . The obvious advantage is the familiarity of the user interface and therefore the low learning curve . An iOS version of Facebook At Work is already available and an Android version is likely to follow . Users will be able to link up their profiles or employees can decide to keep both of them separate . Companies can already register their interest for what looks like a subdued debut for a promising product . The usually marketing-savvy firm did n't even issue a press release for the launch of `` Facebook at work '' . Facebook 's stock dipped slightly and are down nearly 1 % since the news went live . The last 18 months though have seen the shares of the company rocket by more than 220 % . Source TechCrunch

When Facebook bought Oculus VR last year , most of us speculated that we 'd eventually see a version of the social network tailored for virtual reality . Sure enough , it 's happening . Speaking at Recode 's Code Media conference , Facebook 's head of product , Chris Cox , said that the company is working on VR versions of its apps that would let users share virtual environments with others . `` I mean , virtual reality is pretty cool . We 're working on apps for VR , '' he said . `` You realise when you 're in it , that you 're looking at the future , and it 's going to be awesome . When you 're in Facebook , you 're just sending around these bits of experience - a photo , video , a thought . '' `` You 'll do it , Beyonce will do it , '' added Cox . We 're not sure why he chose Beyonce as an example here , beyond reaching for a random A-listern to show he 's 'down with the kids ' . Still , Cox said it would be a `` while '' before we see any of this happen . For one thing , they 've got to actually get the first Oculus Rift out of the door : `` We 're a long way away from everyone having those headsets . '' Sounds like a wide launch is still some time off , but will still we get a limited rollout this summer ?

It 's a question that 's been asked many times , including by TechRadar : what happens to your social media accounts when you die ? Facebook 's previous policy let deceased users ' family members submit a request to have their pages `` memorialized , '' but now the social network is finally giving users more control over their own postmortem profiles , the company has announced . Starting today - at least in the US - Facebook is letting users assign a `` legacy contact '' who will be given powers to decide what happens to their profile once they 've shuffled off . That legacy contact will be able to write a post that will be displayed at the top of the memorialized page 's timeline , respond to the user 's friend requests , and update their profile and cover photos . The legacy contact can also download a user 's photos , posts and profile information as an archive , though they wo n't be able to write posts on that person 's behalf , change their settings or view their private messages . Alternately , Facebook users can instruct the company to simply delete their accounts when they pass . You can choose a legacy contact and assign them permissions in your settings under `` security .

The world 's first Ubuntu Phone , the BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition , goes on sale on Monday 9 February and we 've been told by Cristian Parrino , VP of Mobile at Canonical , that we can expect some big name apps appearing on the new mobile operating system . When asked what native apps are coming to Ubuntu Phone Parriono said `` Several . Facebook , Twitter , eBay , Time Out , Yelp , as well as community developed apps working on Spotify and Dropbox APIs . Lots . Just about every digital platform , in some cases the top brand , others from valid alternatives '' . However there was one major app that wo n't be appearing on Ubuntu Phone just yet – WhatsApp . The incredibly popular social app wo n't be part of the almost 1,000 apps from big names around the world that are coming to Ubuntu Phone . The Ubuntu Phone is a completely new mobile operating system , and as Cristian Parrino pointed out `` we 're not coming out with another iOS or Android –Ubuntu Phone offers whole new way to interact '' . Unlike in Android and iOS where apps are tightly restricted and controlled by the platform owners ( especially in Apple 's case ) , and placed in a grid for users to poke at , Canonical is trying something rather different with Ubuntu Phone . Rather than displaying separate apps in grids , Ubuntu Phone is looking to aggregate content and services via `` Scopes '' , which will integrate various apps and services into an easy to use interface , so users do n't have to scroll through screens of icons . Scopes offer up different home screens that aggregate sources , so you could have a music Scope that combines the MP3s you 've stored locally with your playlist of favourite tracks on YouTube . Clicking the YouTube source would open it up full screen to be used much like a native app . According to Parrino `` Scopes are a game changer for us . They can be made at a fraction of the time it takes to make an app '' . A whole new ecosystem means that native apps need to be built from the ground up for Ubuntu Phone but Canonical is looking at making it easy to port apps from its desktop Linux distribution Ubuntu to Ubuntu Phone , promising a future where desktop and phone apps will use the same code . The quality and quantity of apps on an emerging mobile operating system is essential – just look at Microsoft 's struggle with Windows Phone – so it 's good to see that Ubuntu Phone will get some big name apps . If you 're a fan of WhatsApp , however , you 'll want to stick with iOS or Android for now .

Facebook has updated its privacy policy yet again , and it may have gone too far this time in its hateful quest to show you ever more specific ads . The new policy says Facebook can track everything you do online - even on apps and websites that have nothing to do with Facebook - using tools that other sites can choose to implement . The social network monitoring what you do while underneath its crumbling blue roof is one thing , but this is kind of ridiculous . The company has claimed in the past that users want to see ads that are targeted more personally toward them , but even if that 's true it says nothing of whether Facebook users also want the social network to track their every move to get that data . And naturally this is n't an opt-in kind of program - the changes went into effect automatically for all users on January 30 . It seems you can opt out through Facebook 's mobile apps , but that may only affect what ads you see , not what data Facebook tracks . European privacy authorities are reportedly already up in arms about Facebook 's latest violation , so hopefully it 's just a matter of time before users get fed up too .

Facebook 's annual F8 developer conference , attended by more than 3,000 app developers , is n't really annual at all , having failed to make an appearance in 2013 , 2012 and 2009 . However , this certainly has n't lessened the excitement surrounding the event and this year anticipation , particularly surrounding plans for Oculus Rift , was palpable – even as the European Commission warned the EU that they should close their Facebook accounts to avoid being spied on by US security services , and the UK 's BladeRoom Group filed a lawsuit with the social networking giant for theft of intellectual property . CTO Mike Schroepfer certainly was n't distracted by events outside of F8 , announcing on day two of the conference that Facebook was `` here to talk about the future '' , setting the tone for the most notable announcements , including where Rift fits into the social network . Facebook 's core priorities appear to revolve around Oculus Rift , drones and AI , all intended to make Facebook more 'lifelike ' and 'useful ' . The $ 2 billion ( around £1.3 billion , AU $ 2.6 billion ) purchase of Oculus Rift a year ago prompted a lot of head scratching at the time , although the world 's collective scalps were soothed by Mark Zuckerberg 's explanation at the time that he saw Rift as a `` new communication platform '' and a `` platform for many other experiences , '' and not merely a fillip to gaming companies . `` By feeling truly present , you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life , '' he went on . `` Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game , studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face . '' A year on and , even without an F8 two-dayer , we 're all pretty clued up to roughly where Zuckerberg sees Rift fitting in o the new Facebook 'family ' – a new means of communication through the social media platform ; a future where the internet will rely heavily on virtual and augmented reality tech and applications . F8 provided the Facebook team an opportunity to paint a more vivid picture of where they see things going with Oculus Rift : opportunities to connect the world over as if all are in the same room together . But there 's a way to go yet . As Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer explained : `` After thousands of demos we know we are just on the cusp , just getting there to get that sense of presence where for a moment your conscious brain is overruled by the subconscious that says , 'You are not where you think you are ' . '' And Facebook could n't ( or would n't ) give a timeframe on when Oculus Rift headsets will be available , so it 's very much a case of watch this ( head ) space . However , the newly announced spherical video gives everyone a taste – a `` first step '' – of what Oculus Rift will be able to do , once it 's launched properly as part of the Facebook family . Spherical video is set to allow Facebook users to interact with immersive , 360-degree videos in their Facebook News Feeds , following YouTube 's lead . The videos are shot with 24 cameras , all working in concert , allowing viewers to `` move around inside '' the video and view from a variety of angles . Soon , said Zuckerberg , `` you 're going to be able to put on your Oculus headset and view spherical videos there too . '' And Rift is only one member of this new Facebook family . As Zuckerberg explained : `` Facebook used to be this single blue app and it did a lot of different things , now Facebook is a family of apps . Moving from being a single service to a family of apps is the biggest shift we 've made in our strategy in helping connect people . ''

It 's been a funny old week . We 've seen One Direction go in two directions , witnessed a global outcry because a man was disciplined for punching a co-worker in the face and seen the worst viral video of all time featuring Nick Clegg . But while the world outside may be frightful , the world of tech is mainly delightful . This week we discover why Google Glass will make a comeback , how Facebook plans to claim your immortal soul and why this year 's laptops will make you more excited than a Top Gear presenter in a Porsche . Guaranteed to be 1,000 % more interesting than a star in a reasonably priced car , it 's week in tech ! `` Facebook wants to be everything to everybody '' , Gary Marshall says , and it `` wants to replace the internet . '' He might be right . This week Facebook unveiled the latest steps in its world domination plan with apps to replace email , SMS and newspapers and what Marshall describes as `` all of our messaging personal data and interpersonal interactions and shopping and health data and hopes and fears and dreams and darkest secrets . '' One of the biggest stories is the news that Facebook Messenger will become a platform that third parties can use , so you 'll see apps using Facebook to deliver their messages . There are already 40 apps for the platform , and they 'll show up inside the Facebook app so you never have to leave its warm embrace . That 's not all . There 's video embedding so you can put Facebook videos in non-Facebook places , a new phone app that enables you to make calls from inside Facebook , reports of newspaper and magazine deals so you can read their content from inside Facebook , an update to Messenger that enables you to pay people and buy things from inside Facebook , Facebook at Work so businesses can do business from inside Facebook and Oculus VR apps so that you can live your entire life inside Facebook . In short : Facebook Facebook Facebook Facebook Facebook . It seems that live video streaming is set to be the next big wave in `` social media '' , with Meerkat debuting to a lot of buzz earlier this month . Periscope , the latest app of this ilk to get people talking , launched this week with one key differentiator : it 's backed by Twitter . It also lets you archive clips for viewing later - something that Meerkat does n't . We had a go at making our own Periscope stream on the day of launch , before putting it head to head with Meerkat . We love PC gaming , and we 've devoted an entire week to it : from the best PC Zombie shooters of all time to the power of Minecraft and the tech that 's going to transform the way we play games , everything you need to know about gaming 's past , present and future is right here . Let 's be honest . For all its joys , Android is often spoiled by manufacturers and carriers who insist on putting their own apps on your pristine new smartphone . Hurrah for Samsung , then , because it 's decided that customers who buy the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge will be able to remove the pre-installed applications . That 's going to make a lot of Samsung fans very happy . Technology is a happy , sunny thing , except for when it is n't . Rene Millman has uncovered the tech sector 's dirty laundry and shared some of the dark secrets of the industry . Those secrets include crazy cost-cutting , discrimination and disappearing kit . While Facebook tries to take over the virtual world , Amazon 's continuing to annex more and more of the real one . Its latest wheezes include sticks and drones . The former is its Fire TV Stick , available for as little as £7 to new Prime subscribers and capable of turning even hotel TVs into Amazon Prime Instant Video viewers , and the latter is its ongoing investment in flying machines . While its drones are still grounded in the UK , the US has given Amazon the go-ahead to begin test flights for drone deliveries .
Update : Or not . Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer has taken to Twitter to state that he did n't intend to announce a release date for the Rift . All he meant to say , apparently , was that PC hardware capable of running powerful VR experience is available this year . He added , `` sorry if it was confusing but do n't know exact dates on these things yet '' . Hmmmm . Original story below ... During F8 2015 , Facebook 's Developer Conference annually held in San Francisco , Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer said we can expect virtual reality this year , likely in the form of Oculus Rift . Schroepfer was n't 100 % clear that it would be the final Rift releasing but his statement was more telling than Palmer Luckey 's recent response about the VR headset 's 2015 launch . This seems to fall in line with John Carmack 's earlier hint that we can expect to see the Samsung Galaxy S6 Innovator 's Edition of the Gear VR ( S6 ) at the end of year as well . Keep in mind , anything that does launch will still be a developer 's kit and not a completed head mounted display . Oculus Chief Scientist Michael Abrash gave a short presentation on human perception and its importance to VR , ending the keynote by reiterating that Oculus Rift will be shipping soon . He was also carefully vague and focused on how virtual reality still has a long way to go because its `` just barely good enough . '' However , Abrash also said that VR can `` potentially change the world '' and is progressing more than it previously has . With improvements made to haptics , visuals , audio and tracking , Abrash is confident VR as a platform will succeed .

Facebook 's F8 conference may be geared toward the guys and gals that help make our favorite social network tick , but there were plenty of announcements that 'll impact the everyday usage of folks like you and me . Perhaps most telling at this F8 was the Day 2 keynote 's devotion to virtual reality . Facebook bought Oculus one year ago , and Mark Zuck and Co were clearly ready for the Rift maker to take center stage in front of its developer crowd . We also heard plenty about Messenger and Facebook 's plans to have the service replace text messages and email . Whether you love it or hate it , Facebook is going whole hog on Messenger . But enough chitchat - tag along as we break down the top news from F8 2015 . Probably the biggest revelation of this year 's dev con came from Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer , who vaguely announced we can expect virtual reality to arrive in 2015 . While he did n't go so far as to say it 'll be the final Oculus Rift we see before the year is up , it 's a safe bet this is the VR headgear he was referring to , namely because of the small matter of Facebook owning Oculus . Update : Schroepfer backed off his keynote comments on Twitter , saying he did n't `` announce anything regarding shipping '' and was instead referring to PC hardware available this year that can create VR experiences . He apologized for the confusion and said the exact dates `` on these things '' are n't known yet . Innnnteerreessttiinng . Schroepfer 's keynote statement does corroborate with Oculus founder Palmer Luckey 's own vague tease that Rift will be out this year . Oculus CTO John Carmack 's previously alluded to Gear VR for the Galaxy S6 releasing by year 's end as well , which should put pressure on Rift to come out in time to compete . The other big ticket item out of F8 was Messenger related . Facebook is positioning the chat client it forced onto users as an end-all-and-be-all communication station . How 's it going to do that ? For starters , by giving you third-party apps for new ways of expression and communication with friends . The Messenger Platform allows developers to create applications specifically for these ends , though as we found out it really comes down to GIFs and selfies , at least for now . TechRadar Associate Editor Lily Prasuethsut checked out some of the 40 applications already created for Messenger , deeming them perfect for the selfie generation . Additionally , Businesses on Messenger seeks to revolutionize the way businesses communicate with customers . Launching in a few weeks , the feature will let businesses send things like shipping details and order confirmations to customers , who must opt in to receive the notifications . Customers can also ask businesses free-form questions about their orders . Facebook hopes this kind of interaction will create a more personable e-commerce experience , one akin to what we used to have back in the day of brick-and-mortar shopping . The feature is currently being tested with Everlane and zulily , and more business integrations will launch in the coming weeks . Being that VR was a major theme of F8 2015 , it was no surprise Facebook revealed a feature perfect for the future tech during its Day 1 keynote . Spherical videos , basically 360-degree vids that let users control where they 're looking , are coming to the News Feed . Not only will this lend a new dimension to Facebook 's main hub , it also makes it VR ready . Imagine wearing an Oculus Rift , popping into your News Feed and being instantly immersed in a video posted by one of your friends . Spherical videos seem like an early but important step in Facebook creating the kind of connected immersion needed for VR to succeed beyond games . We can only expect there will be more such features to come . Michael Abrash , Oculus ' chief scientist , was candid in his keynote presentation about the state of VR . `` VR is just barely good enough , '' he said . `` It can get better . '' Blunt words from someone dedicated to making virtual reality viable , and his honesty speaks to the hurdles still remaining when it comes to improving things like sense of presence . Of course , Facebook and Oculus are dedicated to making VR happen ( they have that 2015 release date to hit , after all ) . Abrash said getting users ' hands and bodies into virtual worlds , improving interaction with other people , and pulling in elements of the real world , like mice and keyboards , are areas being worked on . He also noted the tech can potentially change the world , so there 's no sign of development slowing down in any measure . While occupied with virtual reality and GIF chats , Facebook is still working on the very real issue of connecting the world with the internet . The company announced during the F8 Day 2 keynote it 's conducted the first test flight of its UAV platform in the UK , a crucial development in its work to connect people living in even the remotest areas . The solar-powered drone will have a final wingspan larger than a Boeing 737 but it will weigh less than a car . Cruising at altitudes of over 60,000 feet , the drones are designed to fly for long periods of time without ever coming down . As with every keynote by every company , Facebook had some bragging to do about its users and the amount of time they spend on the social network and its various properties . Among the figures to stick out were 600 million and 3 billion . That 's 600 million monthly Messenger users and 3 billion videos viewed on Facebook a day . Yes , that 's `` billion '' with a `` b '' and that 's a day , as in , every 24 hours .

Love it or hate it , Facebook just released new features for its Messenger app and is now dubbing it the Messenger Platform . With the new platform , developers can make apps that utilize GIFs , photos , videos , audio clips and whatever else they think makes communicating more expressive and creative for Android and iOS devices . There are 40 apps and counting you can download right now to use with Messenger that have `` optimized flow '' - which just means they 'll show up directly inside the Facebook app and can be found via the More tab ( the three dots found on the bottom right of the app ) . If you do n't already have the app installed , you 'll have to head over to the app store and download it . Facebook has made the process easier by allowing direct downloads through Messenger - if your friend is using Giphy and you want it too , there will be a `` Reply '' link in your message giving you the option to install it or simply quickly respond with the app . Not all the apps will have this feature though . Facebook will be screening every submitted app to approve it for the Reply links and the More button . You wo n't be able to use all the apps with Messenger immediately but the update should start rolling out today . There are also apps that are only available on iPhone 5 , iPhone 6 or the iPhone 6 Plus . Most Android devices with 4.0 and up should work . In the meantime , here are five apps we 've enjoyed so far that are completely ready for Facebook Messenger Platform . Ultratext is a pretty fun way to send text messages in GIF form but all the really cool stuff requires spending a few bucks here and there . Demoed during the F8 ( Facebook Developer 's Conference ) , Giphy is bringing everyone 's favorite GIFs to Messenger . Pick your favorite GIF then hit the share button to send it off to your friends . So far , it does n't seem like this app is widely available yet . Want to replace your face with a sticker ? Then use Stickered in Messenger for another way to send photos . It already has some familiar stickers found on Facebook and it 's completely free . The only downside ? Pusheen cat is nowhere to be found . It seems Facebook loves stickers . Emu is another sticker app that 's ready for Messenger right now . Take a selfie of yourself and go nuts decorating with the various packs the app offers before sending it to all your friends . Placing your images with animated overlays - basically another GIF app - is what PingTank promises to do . Other apps on the list seem to do a slightly better job , but the Messenger integration has n't shown up when we tried to use them .
Facebook unveiled its vision for Messenger at its F8 developer conference today , and it 's far more robust than its 600 million monthly users may have expected . Facebook Messenger will no longer be a means just for quick and silly chats : it 's now an entire platform , one that has its sights set on rendering texts and emails obsolete . With the new Messenger Platform , developers can create apps specifically for Messenger that utilize GIFs , photos , videos , audio clips and whatever else they can cook up to make communicating more expressive and creative . Users will have more ways to interact using third-party apps , and developers will have greater exposure and engagement thanks to the Platform , Facebook said . When users receive a message from an app they do n't have , clicking `` Install '' will take them directly to the app store to install the application . If users have the app but are n't using it in Messenger , hitting `` Reply '' will take them to the app to start using app-appropriate content . The revamped Messenger will have what is essentially a featured app tab that provides a shortcut for Messenger apps already installed and highlights applications users may be interested in checking out . Among the apps already made for Messenger Platform are Pic Stitch , Ditty and ESPN . The Messenger Platform SDK is open to developers now and 40 apps are ready for users to start using today . User-to-user conversations are n't the only thing seeing an update in Messenger . Businesses also now have the ability to communicate with customers directly , sending personalized and detailed messages with order confirmations , shipping status updates and more to their clients . Users will opt to have messages sent to them by businesses , so do n't expect spam notifications to start appearing in your chat streams . Customers can reach out to businesses via Messenger , too , creating a two-way flow of free-form questions and answers . Facebook hopes Businesses on Messenger creates a personable shopping experience akin to the good ol ' days when we 'd pop into actual stores and talk to actual humans rather than tap on our screens to buy goods . To start , Facebook has partnered with Everlane and zulily and it 's working with Zendesk to support live chats . Look for the business integrations to launch in the coming weeks .
Facebook Messenger 's fancy new digs are n't the only thing CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed during today 's F8 conference keynote . The Facebook creator also introduced spherical videos that will soon begin appearing on your News Feed . Users can see all around in the space in which the videos were taken , essentially controlling where their view is pointing at any given moment . This type of interactive video is not new by any stretch , but it is new to Facebook . The company , which purchased virtual reality pioneer Oculus VR in 2014 , hopes Facebook users will also view the 360-degree videos while wearing the Oculus Rift headset . With reportedly 3 billion videos viewed on Facebook every day - an absurdly large number , if accurate - Zuckerberg said he expects videos to keep growing and eventually become the main way people communicate on Facebook .
Updated : It appears the news is as good as confirmed . Ahead of Facebook 's F8 event , a number of people are receiving a notification that pre-announces `` Messenger as a platform '' . This is going to be one of the biggest focuses of F8 by the look of things . We 'll hear more very soon , but it sounds like the plan is to let app developers do cool things with Messenger . For example , shopping and paying bills could soon be doable through the platform , and that 's just scratching the surface of possibilities . Original story below ... Instant messaging apps are stealing eyeballs away from the big social networks and Facebook knows it : that 's why it wants to expand its Messenger app to include a host of new features . Features could include more options for sharing content , better access for third-party developers , and the ability to host other services on top of Facebook Messenger . Essentially , Mark Zuckerberg and his team want to turn it into a platform in its own right , according to `` multiple sources '' speaking to TechCrunch . Letting you pay your friends through Messenger is just the first step , it would seem . Soon you could be messaging your mobile operator through the app or using it to keep up with the latest viral videos of the day . Facebook apparently wants to follow the lead of the big messaging apps in Asia like WeChat and Line - these apps have expanded from being one-on-one communication tools to fully fledged portals that support calls , gaming , different kinds of content and other apps that are built on top . Line , for example , lets you follow your favourite sports teams and celebrities as well as ping your friends ; Snapchat , meanwhile , has also broadened its horizons with the Discover page . You can expect Facebook Messenger to follow suit in the next few months . The rumour is that all of this new functionality is going to be unveiled at the F8 developer conference on on March 25 , and TechRadar will be there to bring you the news as it breaks .
Facebook is breaking out its equivalent of a `` Greatest Hits '' album with a new feature that recycles your old content from years gone by . `` On This Day , '' drawing only from today 's date , surfaces status updates , photos , posts from friends and other things you 've shared or been tagged , according to the social media company . This time capsule can be found at facebook.com/onthisday , but the company warns that it 's not available for everyone . It 's another slow feature roll out . Facebook also made clear that only you see this past content . Those embarrassing photos of you and an ex , for example , are shared with friend if you decide to reshare ( or re-reshare ) . If Facebook 's On This Day feature sounds familiar , it should . It apes the underrated Timehop app that also reports what you did one , two , three and so on , years ago . Timehop , available for iOS 8 and Android , actually goes a few steps further by showing Twitter , Instagram , Flickr and Foursquare posts too . However , Facebook 's siloed take on this may be more convenient with the ability to subscribe to notifications so that you know when you have memories to look back on . Sometimes , services like On This Day and Timehop let you see how much you have or have n't grown . It 's a scary proposition . But the benefit is not having to always dive back into a crowded Timeline to retrieve those memories .

It must be amazing to work for Facebook . Where other people might encounter a minor irritation and think `` ah , that 's a bit annoying '' , Facebook thinks `` let 's solve it by making it part of Facebook ! '' That 's no doubt the thinking behind Facebook 's latest bright idea , which is to stop people visiting newspaper and magazine websites and getting them to view the content on Facebook instead . According to the New York Times : `` In recent months , Facebook has been quietly holding talks with at least half a dozen media companies about hosting their content inside Facebook rather than making users tap a link to go to an external site… News articles on Facebook are currently linked to the publisher 's own website , and open in a web browser , typically taking about eight seconds to load . Facebook thinks that this is too much time , especially on a mobile device '' . Imagine the suffering that will be eased when it does n't take up to eight seconds – eight seconds ! – to visit a website and wait for its page to load . Imagine how much easier everybody 's lives will be when Facebook runs the back-end , serves up the ads , tracks the visitors and tweaks what it knows about them . The same applies to phones . Is n't it annoying when , about once every couple of weeks , you get a call from somebody you do n't want to talk to ? Would n't it be great if Facebook could scan all your contacts , provide your phone app and screen your calls for you ? Of course it would ! It applies to the internet too . Is n't the internet expensive and rubbish ? Would n't it be great if we just replaced the internet with Facebook , and got operators to give it to us for free , and trusted all of our messaging personal data and interpersonal interactions and shopping and health data and hopes and fears and dreams and darkest secrets with Mark Zuckerberg and his happy team of awesome engineers ! Of course it would be ! Facebook wants to be everything to everybody . It bought Instagram because it wants to be your photo provider . It bought WhatsApp because it wants to be your messaging provider . It bought Oculus because it wants to be your VR provider . It bought Ascenta because it wants drones to bring Facebook to every corner of the world . Facebook wants to replace the internet . What could possibly go wrong ? Well… everything . Let 's look at another tech giant , the Google of `` do n't be evil '' fame . Leaked documents from the US Federal Trade Commission demonstrate that Google threatened to ban websites from search results if they did n't let Google use its content , among many other examples of Google throwing its considerable weight around in `` it 's my way or the highway '' fashion . You 'll recall Microsoft getting into similar hot water over its bully-boy tactics during the browser wars . The regulators moved against Microsoft for that , and it seems EU regulators will soon file charges against Google . And in a few years time , they 'll no doubt be filing against Facebook . Tech firms have a tendency to try and control everything , and they often end up with nothing as a result . Remember CompuServe and AOL , the dinosaurs of the dial-up era ? They tried to hang onto their dying business and pretend the open internet did n't exist , and the former is long gone while the latter is a shadow of its former self , employing Nathan Barley-esque visionaries while relying on dial-up subscriptions from people who are very old or very dead . Microsoft 's browser bullying meant it did n't innovate , leaving a gap Firefox and later Chrome would gladly fill . And Google may have escaped US regulatory scrutiny , but it 's attracted the ire of the EU . The problem with organisations such as Microsoft , Google and Facebook is n't that they 're evil . Far from it . They genuinely believe that what 's best for Microsoft , or for Google , or for Facebook , is what 's best for you and me – so when they start throwing their weight around they genuinely do n't think they 're being wicked . Wickedness might not be the intention , but it could well be the reality . Let 's say you 're a publisher , and you throw your weight behind Facebook . You let Facebook publish your content . You let Facebook run the ads . You sign a deal with Facebook to get X amount of the income for Y years . You 're happy , and then Facebook changes the game . Relying on somebody else 's platform is a Faustian pact . Look at the music industry , clinging to the streaming liferaft while it destroys their margins . Look at magazines , giving their worldly possessions to Readly for a fraction of what they got previously ( I 'm sure I 'm not the only person who 's binned stacks of subscriptions for Readly 's £9.99 per month ) . Look at broadcasters waking up in the wee small hours having had another nightmare about Netflix . The thing about Faustian pacts is that their benefits only last so long . In the legend , Faust got 24 years of unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures before the Devil came to claim his soul . You can be pretty sure that if you hand over the reins to Facebook in return for traffic , or your phone app in return for slightly better screening , you 'll end up regretting it a lot more quickly than that .

Facebook is getting a bit too cosy with our smartphones . It already has a good portion of our social networking time and our messaging , and it 's making a play for payments too . Now inventors of the liking stuff want to take over your phone calls , with an app imaginatively titled Phone . Facebook is n't even certain if it 'll be releasing the app , but that obviously has n't stopped the internet wringing its hands about the possibilities . All that 's confirmed so far is that it 's an Android dialler app that will `` show you info about who is calling and automatically blocks calls from commonly blocked numbers . '' Facebook is pushing the dialler app with the idea it 'll block sales calls and those infuriating PPI claim calls we all see to get on a weekly basis . Great news for everyone . Not having to deal with those kind of cold callers would likely cause the world to have a Return Of The Jedi-esque Ewok party – no-one is going to be disappointed with the notion of losing that infuriating annoyance . But what if Facebook screws it up ? What if a commonly blocked number turns out to be someone I actually want to speak to ? If my mobile phone network 's official line is dubbed a nuisance call they could try to contact me and I 'll never know as Facebook has decided to play parent and censor my calls before it reaches my phone . If Facebook 's Phone takes over as the main dialler all my phone calls will be fed through it , but then where does that information go ? It suddenly makes that scene in The Dark Knight where with Lucius Fox has access to every phone in Gotham seem substantially less unlikely . The question is who gets my call information . Facebook exists to sell my information on – I 've come to terms with that – but I do n't want to add my phone call log into the room-filling pile of details the white and blue F already has on me . Zuckerberg already has my name , location , interests , sex , sexual orientation , religious beliefs , relationship status and what I had for breakfast at his fingertips . Does he also need to know how often I call my mum ? Facebook has just under 1.4 billion users , and a lot of them have entered their phone number at one time or another , especially after being asked for it when downloading the Messenger app . That means Facebook 's very own Blue Pages directory is already bursting at the seams with contact numbers . It would be useful to see who is calling me without even being friends with them – just because I do n't have someone on Facebook it does n't mean I 'm not a friend or acquaintance in real life . Then again , how often would that actually prove useful ? Most of the people I contact on a regular basis are already in my contact list on my phone whether we are connected on Facebook or not . And surely contacting someone who has n't got Facebook or has chosen to keep their number separate to their account will add those details into the Blue Pages directly as well . So it 's not just my contact details here , it 's the privacy of everybody I contact at stake as well . Security smartarses might be tempted to suggest `` just do n't enter their name or other details '' at this point – but how many phone numbers do you know off by heart in the year 2015 ? Privacy is a much bigger deal to me than knowing I 'll be blocking the odd call from unwanted numbers , and I do n't want Zuckerberg 's crew grabbing my number through someone else 's account . I 'd rather deal with the odd chat with Mike about PPI than give Facebook even more of my personal information .
Facebook has confirmed it is working on an Android dialer app called Phone , which is heavily rumoured to be capable of blocking unsolicited phone calls . Facebook confirmed the apps existence to Venture Beat but did n't reveal any more details , merely stating `` we are always testing things and have nothing to announce at this time . '' A screenshot taken by Android Police shows the download link to the app that is currently restricted to Facebook employees only . Trying to download at that stage brings up an error message but reveals the description of `` shows you info about who 's calling and automatically blocks calls from commonly blocked numbers . '' It 's an interesting concept and blocking unsolicited calls is a big ask from Facebook , but if it can get it right it would no doubt find itself in a lot of people 's good books . Facebook has almost 1.4 billion users , many of which have their phone number saved in their profile details , meaning the app may be able to supply you with details of people you do n't even have saved into your phone . There is n't any confirmation from the company that Facebook Phone will be released to the public , but we like what we 've seen so far . Via Venture Beat

There 's a lot of momentum behind virtual reality technology right now , with HTC showing off its Vive headset at MWC and projects from Sony , Samsung and Oculus gathering pace . Now it seems like Google wants a piece of the action with a version of Android built specifically for VR . Of course it would n't be the tech giant 's first foray into the world of virtual reality : its do-it-yourself Cardboard kit and app lets you turn any smartphone into a makeshift VR headset , while Google Glass is a device that operates in the same kind of area . A VR-specific version of Android is one step further though , and would give Google a presence on headsets from multiple manufacturers . Sources speaking to the Wall Street Journal say a small team is now working on the project , though there 's no indication of when we might see it . The majority of virtual reality headsets in development today run software via a connected computer , but an Android VR device would offer greater standalone capabilities ( and of course access to the Google Play Store ) . Google has n't said anything official yet , but considering how keen it is to get Android running on all kinds of devices , it would make sense for the company to be exploring its options in virtual reality as well . If something is in the works , we might well hear more about it at Google I/O in the summer . With Microsoft working on HoloLens and Apple filing VR patents of its own , this is an area of technology that 's only going to get busier - and when you finally do pick up one of these futuristic headsets for yourself , you might have to decide on a mobile OS at the same time .

A devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck near Nepal 's capital of Kathmandu on April 25 , leaving more than 4,000 people dead , many still missing and countless without basic necessities and medical care . Rebuilding efforts are expected to total in the billions . There is a massive international effort underway to provide aid to the region , and dozens of organizations are offering their services . People around the world want to help , and we 've gathered a number of ways you can donate to assist with ongoing relief efforts . Along with organizations like the American Red Cross , tech companies like Apple , Facebook and PayPal have set up ways to donate to relief efforts . iTunes : As it has done for disasters in the past , Apple has linked iTunes up with the American Red Cross . When users head to the iTunes Store , they 'll find a page with donation options to send funds to the Red Cross ' relief efforts in Nepal . 100 % of donations are sent to the organization 's Nepal disaster relief efforts . Since most users keep payment information on iTunes , it takes a quick click to donate funds . Facebook : You should notice a message at the top of your News Feed starting today with the option to donate to the International Medical Corps . The organization has mobile medical units on the ground in Nepal , delivering emergency care to the hardest hit regions , according to a Facebook Newsroom post . Users can donate directly to IMC using Facebook 's Donate feature , and Facebook will match donations up to $ 2 million . The company also activated its Safety Check feature . PayPal : PayPal has set up a campaign called Nepal Earthquake Relief and Recovery , giving users a one-click option to choose which organization they would like to donate to . 100 % of donations go to the organizations as PayPal is waiving all fees . Organizations you can donate to via PayPal include the World Food Program USA , AmeriCares , International Medical Corps and Habitat for Humanity , among others . At the time of this writing , the campaign had raised over $ 264,500 for the various organizations . GlobalGiving : Donations are being accepted via the GlobalGiving.org website , but US residents can also text `` GIVE NEPAL '' to `` 80088 '' to donate $ 10 towards the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund . The organization is looking to raise nearly $ 1.7 million . Many organizations let you donate to their efforts in Nepal directly through their websites . Here are some : T-Mobile and Sprint in the US have waived calling and texting fees to and from Nepal . Customers for both carriers can also text to donate : T-Mobile : Text `` NEPAL '' to `` 20222 '' to donate $ 10 to Save the Children , `` NEPAL '' to `` 864233 '' to donate $ 10 to UNICEF , and `` NEPAL '' to `` 777444 '' to donate $ 10 to World Vision . 100 % of donations go to the charities and will be charged to customers ' phone bill . Sprint : Text `` REDCROSS '' to `` 90999 '' to donate $ 10 on behalf of the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund , `` WFP '' to `` 50555 '' to donate $ 10 on behalf of the UN World Food Programme , `` NEPAL '' to `` 20222 '' to donate $ 10 on behalf of Save the Children , `` NEPAL '' to `` 864233 '' to donate $ 10 on behalf of UNICEF and `` AID '' to `` 27722 '' to donate $ 10 on behalf of the UN World Food Program USA . Google and Microsoft have launched initiatives to help as well . Google 's has set up a dedicated Person Finder so people can look for someone or provide information about an individual . In addition to the online Person Finder tool , Google has set up SMS search . Microsoft is also now offering free Skype calls to landlines and mobile devices in and out of Nepal . In addition to donations , the company said it will continue to assess how its technology and people can help in rescue and relief efforts . Top image credit : Facebook

How much does Facebook affect our lives ? Apparently quite a lot . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg divulged just how much during the company 's quarterly earnings call today by listing off a bunch of numbers that are pretty crazy when you think about it . Here are the more interesting bits : We also use Facebook on mobile the most with 1.5 million people logging on via a mobile device in March . That 's a lot of us using Facebook , Instagram and WhatsApp , and somehow it seems like the numbers are only increasing every year .
On the heels of Google 's Project Fi announcement , Facebook has introduced a new dialer app called Hello . Far less ambitious than Project Fi but potentially useful in its own way , Hello is a free app that lets you make calls over Wi-Fi . You can download it from the Google Play Store and it 's available only on Android smartphones . The Facebook Messenger app already lets you make free VoIP ( Voice over Internet Protocol ) calls but Hello will tap into Facebook to give you more information . Callers will be identified using the social media site even if you do n't have their information , blocked calls will be sent directly to voicemail and you 'll be able to search for people and businesses . The app is similar to WhatsApp - which just rolled out its own voice calling service , WhatsApp Calling - Skype and Viber with the added elements of Yelp and Open Table . At the moment , there 's no word on whether Hello will greet iOS platforms .
Much as we love checking to see exactly when other people read our important messages and divining from that where they are and what they are doing and who they are with and why they have n't responded instantly , when it comes to other people seeing that we 've read their Facebook messages we 're less keen . The answer to at least half of our prayers is the Facebook Unseen Chrome extension , which blocks Facebook read receipts from being sent so your correspondent wo n't know whether or not you saw that request for money . You can even set it so you ca n't see if the other person read your messages , if you 're into that kind of digital self-flagellation .

Facebook 's most recent News Feed updates have mainly been meant to show you more ads , mess with your emotions or change things up in ways that are barely even noticeable . But the latest changes , meant to strike a better balance in your News Feed content , might actually improve things . These changes are threefold . Most importantly , Facebook wants `` to ensure that content posted directly by the friends you care about , such as photos , videos , status updates or links , will be higher up in News Feed so you are less likely to miss it . '' `` This update tries to make the balance of content the right one for each individual person , '' the announcement reads . Today 's update also relaxes a restriction that limits users from seeing multiple posts from the same sources , so that more content can be displayed if they run out of News Feed posts to read . Plus we 'll see fewer posts about friends liking or commenting on other posts , and they 'll be lower down than friends ' direct posts and posts from pages we 've Liked . Facebook said in this announcement that `` the goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you , '' a fact that Facebook 's users might not actually be aware of . Hopefully that goal becomes more apparent , though , as the social network continues to tweak and jigger until things are just right .

Facebook big cheese Mark Zuckerberg has revealed that the company 's free internet project , Internet.org , has its sights set on Europe . Speaking in a Q & A , Zuck was asked if there were plans to expand it to the continent , to which Zuck responded : `` Yes , we want to bring Internet.org [ everywhere ] where there are people who need to be connected . We 're starting off by prioritizing the countries with the most unconnected people and by working with network operators and governments who are most excited about working with Internet.org to get everyone online in their countries . '' The service , which provides basic mobile internet to places previously unconnected , has already launched in India , Zambia , Kenya , Columbia and Tanzania . Zuck defended the service to one user who commented that Internet.org only provides a very basic service , responding , `` having some connectivity and some ability to share is always much better than having no ability to connect and share at all '' . During the hour-long Q & A session , Zuckerberg also revealed that he works just 50-60 hours a week , is excited about expanding Facebook 's Messenger payment feature `` over time '' , and hinted ( yet again ) that Oculus VR is looking well beyond gaming . `` Our mission [ is ] to give people the power to experience anything , '' he wrote . `` Even if you do n't have the ability to travel somewhere , or to be with someone in person , or even if something is physically impossible to build in our analog world , the goal is to help build a medium that will give you the ability to do all of these things you might not otherwise be able to do . '' Richard Branson also stopped by to ask a question , because apparently he does n't have Zuck 's email and this was the only possible way to contact him .

Update : A Facebook spokesperson got in touch to let us know that the company currently has no plans to totally separate Facebook.com from the new standalone Messenger site . `` Messenger.com is meant to give people another option for messaging on the web , '' the spokesperson said . `` Facebook Chat is important to us , and we have no current plans to halt our investments in Facebook Chat . I can confirm that we also have no current plans to require anyone to use Messenger.com . '' So rest easy for now , and keep chatting with your Facebook friends exactly how you have been . Original story below… Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained already why he 's forcing us to use Messenger , but that does n't make the haters hate it any less . The latest development in the Messenger saga wo n't do anything for them , but it does give happy Messenger users a way to chat away from Facebook 's other distractions . The social network today launched a standalone Facebook Messenger web app that you can access through your browser , eliminating the need to go to Facebook.com to see your messages . This is a positive change for people who enjoy using Messenger , and it does n't affect those who 'd rather it stays the same - unlike with Facebook 's mobile apps , users on Facebook.com can currently still see their Messenger chats without going to the external site . But it 's not difficult to imagine Facebook eventually pulling the same stunt in your browser that it did on mobile , forcing users who want to send messages away from Facebook proper and into the separate Messenger app . We 've asked Facebook to comment on whether that might happen , and we 'll update this article if we find out . In the meantime , we know for a fact that Facebook wants Messenger to help it kill email and texting once and for all .

You record a clip and give it a topic , then your friends can add their own clips to your new collaborative video . That 's what 's behind Facebook 's newest app , Riff , announced on April Fool 's day but definitely ( probably ) not a joke . Riff is a collaborative video app that Facebook hopes will inspire ever-widening circles of friends to contribute to lengthy highlight reels that can then be posted to Facebook . Once your friends have added to your original video , their friends can then add to it to , and `` the potential pool of creative collaborators can grow exponentially , '' Facebook says . Riff marks another way an existing tech company is trying to get its users to engage in new methods of sharing , like Twitter 's Vine and even HTC 's Zoe . We 'll see whether it catches on , though , as Riffs also have the potential to become chaotic messes of videos made by a bunch of people you do n't even know . Download Facebook Riff on iOS or Android to start making clips to share with friends and check out the videos that your friends have already started working on .
Facebook is tracking you , whether you 're a user or not , claims a new report . The social network is said to be using cookies to follow European users around the web , even once they 've deleted their account and asked not to be tracked . The research comes from Belgium 's data protection body - you can read the full report here - and claims that some of Facebook 's plug-ins follow users who have never signed up to the service . Doing this would be a violation of European law , which rules that users must be informed if a site is going to give their computer cookies . The Belgian report says that even those who have used Facebook 's cookie opt-out system in the EU are being tracked by a different cookie against their consent . Facebook disputes the claims , stating that the report contains `` factual inaccuracies '' in a general statement . It also says that the report 's authors never contacted it or `` sought to clarify any assumptions upon which their report is based . '' The upshot ? Whether or not the claims are true , Facebook could soon find itself in hot water with the EU .

Neuroscientists from the University of California have discovered that during quiet moments , our brains prepare us for being socially connected to other people . In experiments , the researchers showed people photos with captions while tracking their brain activity . In one set of photos , the captions described the mental state of the person depicted , while the captions of the other set merely described the picture . A third set showed the number of the picture accompanied by a mathematical equation . Participants were then asked to judge whether the captions expressed what the images showed . It turns out that the same areas of the brain ( the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ) lit up during the gaps between pictures as when the mental state captions were shown , but became inactive when the equations and descriptions were displayed . `` The brain has a major system that seems predisposed to get us ready to be social in our spare moments , '' said Matthew Lieberman , a UCLA professor of psychology and of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences . `` The social nature of our brains is biologically based . '' He added : `` It is getting us ready to see the world socially in terms of other people 's thoughts , feelings and goals . That indicates it is important ; the brain does n't just turn systems on . We walk around with our brain trying to reset itself to start thinking about other minds . '' That , the authors believe , is why we like reading Facebook during downtime - the brain gets to do what it 's programmed to do . Lieberman said : `` When I want to take a break from work , the brain network that comes on is the same network we use when we 're looking through our Facebook timeline and seeing what our friends are up to . '' The study results were published in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience .
Whether it be someone falling down the stairs or your favourite quote from The Breakfast Club , there 's now a much easier way to share GIFs with your friends . Facebook has finally adopted GIFs into the news feed so now you can share your moving image files directly into your timeline - no longer do you have to use Giphy 's workaround . Just throw the URL link into a post or a comment and Facebook will do all the hard work for you , allowing you to reply with your true feelings expressed in a moving , repetitive image . Back in 2013 we saw GIFs on Facebook , all thanks to Giphy , but each worked quite like a video and did n't play properly in the timeline . The rollout for proper GIFs have begun now – check out this group for a selection of the best GIFs shared so far – but do n't be shocked if functionality is n't on your account just yet .

Two years ago , Facebook developed a prototype storage system that used 10,000 Blu-ray discs to capture one petabyte of data , the equivalent of 64,000 Samsung Galaxy S6 phones or 100 of HGST 's 10TB hard drives . That technology was developed by Frank Frankovsky who left the social network to found a startup called Optical Archive , one that has been acquired by Sony . Sony is targeting the so-called cold storage market which has been growing exponentially thanks to the billions of selfies and videos created every year by smartphones and other portable devices . A lot of that data is currently stored on hard disk drives and some of it on tape . However , such is the growth in the cloud storage market that hard disk drives are unlikely to be able to fulfil the demand . With flash-based storage still excruciatingly expensive , one of the remaining few viable alternatives seems to be optical discs with Blu-ray being the prime candidate . While the current mainstream technology has reached 50GB , the next generation may hit 300GB , which while impressive is still very far from the 220TB tape medium that IBM and Fujifilm are working on .

So many people on Facebook tried to use the innocuous pre-Bank Holiday phrase `` What 's everyone doing this weekend ? '' that it tripped the network 's spam filters . For a time , trying to ask your friends what their weekend plans are on Facebook Messenger triggered a security alert , saying `` Our security systems have detected that a lot of people are posting the same content , which could mean that it 's spam '' . A status update on the site itself simply came up as `` Action blocked '' . The good news is that Facebook says it 's fixed the problem now . But that 's not going to stop me blaming Facebook when I '' m sitting sad and alone in my house on Monday writing tech news for fun while everyone else gets drunk in the park without me .

Poor Mark Zuckerberg - all he wanted to do was bring internet connectivity to the people of the world that did n't have it , and sign them up for Facebook at the same time - but the protests against his plans are getting louder and more vehement . A new open letter and petition says the project `` violates the principles of net neutrality , threatening freedom of expression , equality of opportunity , security , privacy , and innovation '' . Ouch . One of the problems is that Internet.org provides access to a limited number of whitelisted sites rather than the web as a whole . That means new users connecting in developing nations wo n't have access to the full breadth of the web . Another sticking point is the 'zero rating ' plan , where some sites can be used for free without it counting against a user 's data plan . This makes it easier for poorer communities to access portals like Wikipedia but essentially promotes certain sites above others , which is contradictory to net neutrality principles . Security and privacy are two other concerns mentioned in the open letter : will data be collected on the millions of new users coming online ? And will they be aware of the information they 're giving up ? These are the questions Facebook is being asked to answer . 67 rights groups have put their names to the petition up until now . In a response sent to the BBC , Facebook said the aim was to get people online for free before giving them access to the wider web once they 've seen the benefits it could bring .
Facebook has planted its tanks firmly on Skype 's lawn with an update to its Messenger app that allows users to make and receive video calls . The update is being rolled out to all users on every platform – so it does n't matter what phone you have , so long as you can install the Facebook Messenger app . Make sure the app is up to date and you should see a button allowing you to make a video call to your contacts . You 'll have to make sure that the person you 're calling also has the most up to date version of the app installed . Facebook 's bid to be the most used app on your smartphone has just got stronger , but will you be ditching Skype or Facetime in favour of Facebook Messenger ?

Brace yourselves , even more Candy Crush invites are coming . Facebook is looking to include games in its Messenger chat platform , a new report by The Information revealed . The plan to bring games to the Messenger mix was formulated around the idea that good games will continuously draw interest , therefore drawing more people to Messenger . This is n't the first addition intended to attract and keep people in Messenger , though . I 'm sure almost everyone has THAT friend who has a GIF for every moment , or finds a cat emoji to fit your exact emotion . While these novelty additions are an excellent time killer/laugh inducer , Facebook hopes for games to be both permanently lucrative and uniquely enticing . The social network has n't laid out a timetable for rolling out its game function , but the executive that 's heading the project , Ilya Sukhar , confirmed to The Information that the discussion is happening . There 's also no definitive info yet on what games may be included if this comes to fruition , but whatever games there are , please do n't send me invites every day .

If you thought the UK election was dramatic , we hope you 're sitting down : in the world of tech this week we 've seen huge deals , big reveals , amazing advances and some surprising second chances . Facebook 's trying to annexe more of the internet , the tech bubble 's about to burst and the US Army wants to make everything invisible . What the heck ? It 's Week in Tech ! Facebook has unveiled the latest bit of its world domination plan : instead of having us click away to news websites and Buzzfeed , it wants us to view stories without leaving Zuckerberg 's warm embrace . The new Instant Articles platform promises to speed up the internet by getting rid of that whole `` using something that is n't Facebook '' thing . Publishers wo n't have to sign any exclusivity deals or hand over any of their advertising revenue , although if they want to use Facebook 's own ad platform it 'll take an iTunes-style 30 % cut . Remember Ping , Apple 's ill-fated social network for music ? Well , in true Smash Hits style it 's back ! Back ! BAAAAACK ! The incoming iOS 8.4 will feature a `` deep social networking integration for artists '' that should enable them to post exclusive content to their fans . Interestingly , it looks like Apple Music is coming to Android too . We should see iOS 8.4 released to coincide with WWDC 2015 next month . Fresh from the success of the Moto 360 it looks like Motorola is prepping a successor : a new listing on the Bluetooth SIG website mentions a new `` Motorola Android Device '' running Bluetooth 4.1 and with the model number BTWM03 . Given that BTWM01 was the Moto 360 , it 's pretty obvious that we 're talking about a smartwatch . With Google I/O just a few weeks away , it 's possible we 'll see it unveiled then – and we already have a wishlist of what we 'd like to see . Do you fancy owning a Moto 360 that can talk to your iPhone ? You do n't need to wait for Google to make Android Wear iOS-compatible . As long as you have access to an Android device to set it up , it 's actually quite easy to make the Moto 360 and an iPhone fast friends . Good news for fans of the gibberish-spouting , electric-haired `` digital prophet '' Shingy : US telecoms firm Verizon has just bought him for 4.4 billion dollars , and as part of the deal they get AOL too . Older internet users will remember AOL as many people 's first online experience , and many of those older users are still with it : it has 2.1 million people still using dial-up to get online . For those of us with slightly speedier connections , AOL is the firm that owns Engadget and TechCrunch . It 'll be interesting to see what happens next , because whenever AOL merges with another company it usually brings the entire stock market down with it : its 2000 acquisition of Time Warner nearly broke capitalism . Then again , in 2000 AOL Time Warner was worth a cool $ 350 billion . The Verizon deal values it as one eightieth of that . Google has temporarily withdrawn its crowd-sourced Map Maker tool after a spate of pranks including the image of the Android robot urinating on the Apple logo . Google 's attempts to crack down on such toilet-related tomfoolery backfired , causing a whole bunch of pranksters to add their own obscene contributions . There 's no indication of when the app will return , but Google promises that its absence is temporary . Buenas noticias ! Bonnes nouvelles ! Gute Nachrichten ! καλα νεα ! Yes , Skype Translator , the magic Babel Fish service that can translate speech in real time , is now available to everybody . All you need to use it is a PC , laptop or tablet running Windows 8.1 or the Windows 10 preview . It knows 50 different languages offers speech to tech and text-to-speech , and it 's brilliant . Fancy a drone that follows you around like a flying puppy ? Meet Lily . She loves you - although she might love you a little bit less if you use Yamaha 's Typedrummer to turn your typing into beats . In other news , somebody just bought the world 's only working Tron Legacy light cycle for a cool $ 77,000 ( about £50,000 or AU $ 98,000 ) , Amazon announced its plans for delivery drones that can hunt humans , and the US Army decided it wants to make its soldiers invisible within 18 months . Blimey .

Facebook is taking on web news - with its Instant Articles allowing major media to put their wares straight onto the social network as well ( or rather than ) on their own sites . Working with major players at the start , like the BBC , Guardian , Buzzfeed and National Geographic , the move is potentially transformative to the internet . Although many doubts will surface about the return of a walled-garden private internet , controlled by a single entity , Facebook will feel that this is a major step in remaining relevant and getting news to its younger demographic . Facebook has also insisted that the move will help end delays of those clicking on links to external sites , citing mobile phone users as a primary reason for the need for a streamlined experience . The media owners will have a 100 % share of revenue from any adverts that are sold on the pages - at least to start with - and some will choose to only host bits of content on the social network , eschewing their own sites . The BBC has already confirmed that it will not go down this route : `` Some will be using those tools to make tailored content for Instant Articles , others , including the BBC , which will soon start using the service with its Newsbeat material , will decline that option . `` They will not want to put on Facebook 's servers anything that is not available on their own sites . '' The articles will have extended functionality , with a blog post from Facebook explaining : `` Along with a faster experience , Instant Articles introduces a suite of interactive features that allow publishers to bring their stories to life in new ways . `` Zoom in and explore high-resolution photos by tilting your phone . Watch auto-play videos come alive as you scroll through stories . Explore interactive maps , listen to audio captions , and even like and comment on individual parts of an article in-line . ''

If you 've noticed that Facebook has begun bombarding you with suggestions to wish a happy birthday to someone you barely know – or like – then you 're not the only one ; it has emerged that a bug in the social media 's notification system has caused this deluge . Normally you should only get one notification reminding you of a friend 's birthday , however people have been receiving numerous emails reminding them to log in and wish a happy birthday . Although Facebook admits this was a glitch , sending out birthday reminders helps encourage users to sign in , leave a birthday message and engage with the website – which benefits Facebook . Maybe Mark Zuckerberg wished for this when he was blowing out his candles . Facebook has now fixed the bug , so you should no longer be getting pestered .

Nokia 's Here maps may be the hottest commodity on the market right now . How hot ? Try $ 3 billion ... hot . Uber has reportedly submitted a bid for as much as that figure to snap up Nokia 's mapping service , according to The New York Times . Uber is said to be up against a consortium of German auto makers , including Audi , BMW and Mercedez-Benz , China 's search engine firm Baidu , a private equity firm and , at least at one time , Facebook . Everyone wants Here , and Nokia could hand over the reigns by the end of the month . Uber would stand to gain a number of benefits if it bought Here . For one , it 'd flush out the mapping features of its taxi/ride-sharing service , which currently relies on bits from Google Maps , Apple Maps , other companies ' mapping data and its own online data . Analysts speaking to the NYT noted Here could help Uber Pool in pairing coordinating ride-shares . Buying Here would also help Uber distance itself from Google , a backer of Uber through its venture capital division . Uber is apparently facing stiff competition from the automakers for Here , however . Here dominates the built-in car navigation system market and is likely seen as a boon for companies trying to expand their in-car technologies as well as develop autonomous vehicles , such as Mercedes . Will Uber win out ? Only time will tell .

The main problem with Facebook is all the people on it . They insist on continually doing and saying annoying things . If only everyone could just be as cool and brilliant as you , checking your feed would be a joy and life would be a dream . But , come now , admit it : even you , bastion of Facebook etiquette and overseer of internet dos and don'ts , have been known to slip . That photo of a cocktail by a pool on a Monday afternoon while you were on holiday ? That tiny little humblebrag you thought we all forgot about ? Be a better friend and make never doing these ten things on Facebook your manifesto for life : Someone in Inverness has lost a wedding ring . Someone in Dorset has found a teddy bear . A small child 's tricycle is missing in Arkansas . We get that you 're just trying to play your small role in the Hollywood tale of how a half eaten packet of M & Ms was finally reunited with its rightful owner after being left on the bus in downtown Dallas - and we admire your inexhaustible optimism - but unless you happen to know a lot of people who live in downtown Dallas , you 're not helping . `` Ca n't believe what just happened ... '' `` Some people are n't worth bothering about ! ! Glad I finally know who my friends are . '' `` Well , that 's the last time I drink the blood of innocents ! ! ! '' Yes , we 're all jealous of your trip to Marbella . Yes , we 're amazed that you managed to procreate . Yes , congratulations , you found someone willing to put a ring on it . Yes , we had noticed one or two of the 83 photos you 've posted daily on the matter . Yes , we 're de-friending you now . We 're having enough trouble remembering who you are to begin with , let alone after you changed your name to BooBoo McMuffinchops for a joke that one other person in the world will get . If you 're proud of something you 've done , just straight up brag about it . You 've worked that outfit , you 've nailed that thinkpiece , you 've been retweeted by Ryan Gosling : own it . If you 're embarrassed to say `` Look at this amazing thing I did '' then maybe it 's not as amazing as you thought and you should just send it directly to your mum instead . This is a variation of the humblebrag with a bit of the cryptic status thrown in . `` Anyone know where I can replacement laces for my gold boots ? '' is basically Facebook for `` I have gold boots and I want you all to know about it '' . Everyone you ever met does not need to know about your weird toenail . Save the intricacies of your sex life for IRL chats . Got a medical question ? Keep it between you , your search history and your doctor . Unless you 're 100 % sure that this chat up technique is going to pay off , do NOT use the button that says `` Ask for Bill 's relationship status . '' Also worth noting that this is not a viable way to side-step the `` So are we , like , exclusive or what ? '' talk . There 's no need to immortalise Rachel 's arm flailing about in the background of the bride and groom 's first dance . Her face is almost certainly doing something weird , just leave her out of it . We just got over our Candy Crush addiction , why are you trying to make us relapse ?
Facebook has confirmed Nokia 's Here Maps are being integrated into the social networks main application , as well as Messenger and Instagram as well . The social network confirmed the news to TechCrunch and a Nokia spokesperson later did the same . Neither company is set to make an official announcement though , at least not for the foreseeable future , as it 's still in the testing stages . The testing is also only taking place on Android , iOS and Windows Phone may come later , but a Facebook rep said it will give the service , `` more control and flexibility in delivering a consistent maps experience '' . Nokia 's Maps has been lauded as one of the best options available – adapting that into your Facebook check-ins and photo tags will make for a far more accurate experience . The news comes as rumours heat up about Facebook looking to buy Nokia 's Here Maps app outright . At the moment the service is valued at $ 2 billion and only seems to be going up with interest from Samsung , Apple , Yahoo and even Uber .

Update June 30 : Just over a month after launching in NYC , Facebook Messenger payments are now available to everyone living in the US . No word yet on a global roll-out . Users can complete person-to-payment payments within Messenger just by adding their debit card information . Any funds you send will go directly into the recipient 's checking account . Facebook promises it 's secure , so if you 're tired of always owing your pals money , Facebook Messenger payments may be for you . When the payment option launched in the Big Apple , it brought along a few improvements , including hyperlinked dollar amounts that , when tapped , will automatically start a payment ( senders can confirm the payment before it 's passed along ) . Users can also pay individual friends from within a group chat , and people in the multi-person convo can see who has send money and for what amount . Original article below ... Facebook has launched a new feature for its Messenger app that lets you send money directly to your friends . It 's rolling out `` over the coming months '' in the US and then may ( or may not ) extend elsewhere . Simple , quick mobile payments are being built into a whole host of apps and services : Snapchat introduced a similar scheme in the US last November and the feature arrived in Gmail for UK users in January . That 's on top of established services such as PayPal and new ones like Apple Pay . If you owe your pals a bit of cash then there is now a plethora of different ways to pay them back , with more arriving all the time . The mass appeal of Facebook Messenger makes this one of the more high-profile options , however . The first time users try to make a payment they 'll need to link a valid debit card and set up a PIN . Facebook is promising `` layers of software and hardware protection that meet the highest industry standards '' in the official announcement . If you 're running Messenger on iOS then you can use Touch ID to verify your identity . The social network already has plenty of experience handling payments of course , from advertisers selling their wares and gamers looking to get to the next level of Bubble Witch , so the launch should be a fairly smooth one .

HBO today announced that the premiere episodes of its two latest shows will stream on Facebook starting today . While both Ballers and The Brink premiered on HBO last Sunday , you 'll now only be able to watch the episodes on either HBO Go , HBO Now or Facebook . So if you 're a Facebook user , you can catch up on Ballers on Dwayne Johnson 's ( who stars in the series ) Facebook page , while The Brink can be seen on the show 's own Facebook page . It 's important to note , however , that these premiere episodes will only be made available for a limited time . Tapping into Facebook 's massive user-base ( and with direct access to fans ) , this exclusive partnership is a first between Facebook and HBO , though HBO could turn to the social media giant for other streaming partnerships in the future . This is the second time in as many weeks Facebook has become the medium for streaming new episodes of new shows . Last week , Facebook users were treated to the pilot episode of Amazon 's Catastrophe for a couple of days before it was available on Amazon 's own streaming service , Prime Instant Video . We 've asked Facebook and HBO for a comment on the partnership and will update this story if and when we hear back .
Facebook has announced it 's now giving users the option to sign up for its Messenger chat app without needing to have a Facebook account . `` If you 're in Canada , the United States , Peru or Venezuela , we are starting to roll out a new way for you to sign up for Messenger - without a Facebook account , '' the social network said in a blog post . You will , however , need a phone number ( and to live in the above mentioned countries , until Facebook rolls out the new feature to the rest of the world ) . After opening up the app on a phone , tablet or the web , you 'll be asked if you want to sign up with a Facebook account or if you 're `` Not on Facebook . '' If you do n't have an account , you 'll be given the option to upload your phone contacts . Messenger will then match users that have their numbers linked to their Facebook ( or Messenger ) accounts . The new update to the chat application will give Facebook-less users regular Messenger features , like photos , videos , group chats , voice and video calling and stickers . However , if you do n't have a Facebook account , you will miss out on things like syncing across phones , tablets and web as well as accessing Facebook friends ' contacts and older messages . Still , by opening up Messenger to people who do n't want a Facebook account should put the company 's chat app in a better position against its competition , like WhatsApp and Viber . Will you be signing on to a Facebook-less Messenger ?

If you thought Facebook 's all-seeing eye was pervasive before , the social media giant is now tweaking its algorithm to analyze how long you look at a post in your News Feed . As ominous as it seems , it 's likely that Facebook is adjusting its algorithm because the like/commen/share system does n't fully represent users ' interests . With the current method , your News Feed is primarily built from patterns in your interactions with certain posts . The problem with this is there are certain stories in your News Feed that you certainly care about , but do n't necessarily want to see `` you like this '' underneath . You could comment and show your interest and/or concern that way , but if you 're a more passive Facebook user , most of your comments are probably relegated to friends and family . So , to make a more accurate News Feed , Facebook will essentially keep tabs on how long you hover on certain items . If you linger on a post for long enough , Facebook will start to take that into account and increasingly pepper in similar posts in your feed . Conversely , if you rapidly scroll through certain posts in your feed ( think endless wedding photos , ) Facebook will take your social distastes and log them . The only halfway-concerning part with this algorithm change is that it effectively removes the user from deciding what 's in his or her news feed , a gradual progression that 's been maligned by Facebook users for years . I think almost everyone can relate to the strings of top 10 lists and adorable ( yet annoying ) baby photos conquering feeds . It 's definitely going to take some time to perfect the new system . For example , I 'd hate to accidentally hover over a cat meme while I make a cup of coffee . The algorithm will most likely be gradually implemented , as the social network improves its accuracy . Still , be careful of what you look at : Facebook 's watching .

Remember the Draw Something craze back in 2012 ? It got over 20 million downloads in the first five weeks of release and plenty of us wasted hours and hours doodling on our smartphone screens . Facebook has now adapted a similar game and released it as the first game within the Messenger app . It sounds like a great idea being able to play games with your mates without ever having to leave the chat , but that 's not the case . It 's in fact a separate app that connects up to Facebook Messenger sending them as a separate little photo with an invitation to reply . The app is called Doodle Draw and we 've been playing around on it in the TechRadar office this morning , however the experience is n't great right now . We 've all suffered from different bugs ; one person could n't see what they were drawing as the lines disappeared whenever you take your finger off the virtual paper whilst another was n't able to reply to any of the games . So it 's a bit buggy right now . You can download it from the App Store and Google Play store and then select which friends you 'd like to play with . We hope Facebook will fix Draw Something 's problems ASAP because we can see ourselves getting addicted to it . It looks like a tester game for the platform as well so we 're hoping to see new games pop up in the coming months , hopefully not as broken as this is .

Social media is the most effective way to get people to quit smoking , according to Canadian researchers who compared the effectiveness of different public health campaigns . A team from the University of Waterloo looked at the effectiveness of the social-media-based Break It Off campaign alongside a telephone hotline for young adults looking to quit called Smokers ' Helpline . After three months , 32 % of smokers who used the Break It Off apps and web tools had dropped the habit , compared to just 14 % who used the telephone-based support . The study was limited to 19-29 year olds , and the results adjusted for ethnicity , education level and cigarette use . This age group has the highest rate of smoking in Canada , but rarely engage with traditional stop-smoking services like the telephone helpline in the study . 91 % use Facebook , however , and one third actively use Twitter . `` Traditional cessation services can have limited reach and this reduced visibility lessens their impact in a digital era , '' said Bruce Baskerville , who led the study . `` Because they are such heavy users of social media , these platforms provide an alternative and successful way of reaching smokers who are less likely to relate to other cessation programs . '' The study was published in the journal of Nicotine and Tobacco Research . Photo Credit : benmur via Compfight cc .

Facebook has launched a new Android app dubbed Facebook Lite , which aims to keep those with poor network coverage connected to the social network . Vijay Shankar , Product Manager for Facebook Lite , explained the app `` uses less data and works well across all network conditions . `` In many areas , networks can be slow and not able to support all the functionality found in Facebook for Android . Facebook Lite was built for these situations , giving people a reliable Facebook experience when bandwidth is at a minimum . '' It 's currently not clear which features Facebook Lite misses out on , but you do get core experiences such as News Feed , status updates , photos and notifications . The is likely to be kept to developing nations where network infrastructure is poor , and the number of entry-level devices are higher . Not only will the 1MB Facebook Lite app be quicker to download , it 'll also perform better on budget handsets boasting lesser processors and lower amounts of RAM . Facebook Lite is rolling out from today across Asia , and Facebook plans to bring it to parts of Latin America , Africa and Europe in the coming weeks .
Facebook is attempting to eliminate the deluge of `` Where are you at ? '' messages we send each other every day with a new location sharing feature . Conversions now include a map of your exact location , or another rendezvous point to meet friends , as one of the messages , explained the social media company today . Location sharing in Facebook Messenger is n't actually new . This just works in a more privacy friendly way than its current method hidden within every message and sent unless you opt out . The new update forces users to tap the location pin icon at the bottom of the screen and then send a map of where they are or want to go in an obvious message . Facebook Messenger is a helpful feature that beams your coordinates in a more transparent way than before , but it 's hardly new to app messaging services . Google Hangouts lets users share their current location and even includes a trigger button that pops up when someone asks `` Where are you ? '' Tapping the button sends a map . iMessages includes two handy location sharing features within a message 's Details menu : Send My Current Location and Share My Location . The latter gives the friend or group of friends your location for one hour , until the end of the day or indefinitely , which is convenient for keeping large groups together in a theme park or stadium . In a way , Facebook is just catching up . But it also adds the idea of sending a meet up point to friends , which is a little different than other messaging apps . Today 's Facebook Messenger app update is currently rolling out to iOS and Android devices , in case you are tempted to ask the age-old , hopefully eliminated question : `` Where are you at ? ''

Facebook has today announced that it has completed building an aircraft ready for testing that is capable of delivering internet connectivity . Facebook 's Connectivity Labs has been busy building a full-scale version of 'Aquila , ' which is designed to be a high-altitude , long-endurance aircraft that can circle a region up in the air for up to 90 days using solar power alone . The unmanned drone-like aircrafts will be able to beam down internet connectivity from an altitude of 60,000 to 90,000 feet . `` Our goal is to accelerate the development of a new set of technologies that can drastically change the economics of deploying internet infrastructure , '' Facebook said in its announcement . But Facebook has no intention of become an internet service provider . `` Our intention is not to build networks and then operate them ourselves , but rather to quickly advance the state of these technologies to the point that they become viable solutions for operators and other partners to deploy , '' the social network giant said . The project is part of Facebook 's larger project of finding new ways to deliver solutions in parts of the world where basic internet connectivity , as the company noted that about 10 % of the world 's population live in remote regions with no internet infrastructure at all . Facebook has also built and tested a laser that can deliver data at 10Gb per second , which can be used on Aquila-type planes to connect to each other as well as the regions they circle . The company has previously launched Internet.org , which provides free internet access to developing countries as well .

Facebook is testing out a new feature called Profile Tags , the social network has confirmed to The Verge . Tags help you define who you are and the idea seems to have been borrowed from LinkedIn . `` Profile tags are a creative tool that lets you and your friends add tags to your profile to highlight the things that describe you and what you 're into , '' explained Facebook in a statement . Born out of a Facebook hackathon , there 's no guarantee that this new feature will make it out to everyone - Facebook quite often tests out different ideas with small groups of users before abandoning them again . These tags are freeform and can be just about anything you want : put in your job title , your life philosophy or your areas of expertise . It sounds a bit like those lists of qualities people tend to put in their Twitter bios . The tags are public too , so it may be a way of making you easier to find on the web at large . If you 're stuck for something to say then your friends can add tags for you - though they do n't appear until you 've approved them . Even with more than a billion users to its name , Facebook knows it ca n't afford to stand still and rest on its laurels - most of us still remember what happened to MySpace .

Microsoft has firmed up its relationship with Facebook after adding deeper integration into the company 's newest SDK tool . The new feature makes it easier for developers to design universal apps with Facebook integration from the start and that goes for apps on Windows Phone 8.1 , 8.1 and of course Windows 10 . Using the new SDK , developers can allow various authorizations such as logging in and out , feed or request dialogs , and use Facebook 's Graph to post to a user 's feed , upload a photo , like a page or object and create custom stories . Make no bones about it - Microsoft is betting big on the Windows apps that will be omnipresent across PCs , laptops , tablets , smartphones and any other device running Windows 10 . By adding Facebook integration into the bargain it only goes to bolster their chances in the long run . Windows apps will move to a centralized brand identity and users with a Windows 10 device will recognize them regardless of the device . Further to that , details have already emerged of what Skype will look like across different versions of Windows 10 . We 're already well on the home straight when it comes to the revolutionary new OS that will be released into the wild by July 29 and with integrations like this one , the future of the new OS looks very bright .

Facebook is reportedly working on its own virtual assistant project that will work via Messenger . The virtual assistant , which is apparently internally named 'Moneypenny ' ( yes , from the James Bond films ) , will be powered by humans , unlike virtual assistants like Microsoft 's Cortana , Apple 's Siri and Amazon 's Alexa , according to The Information , . It 's not been made clear exactly what kind of features Moneypenny will have , but it 's said it will allow users `` to ask real people for help researching and ordering products and services , among other tasks . '' The report cites three sources briefed about Moneypenny , and they say that the new feature is being tested internally by employees . The whole thing is said to work via Facebook 's Messenger app . This is another rumor to spring up recently surrounding new projects that Facebook may be working on . With no confirmations or announcements , we 'll just have to wait and see if Moneypenny will end up being a real human-powered virtual assistant that Facebook releases .

Update : Do n't ditch your Spotify account yet . A Facebook representative has officially denied the report of the upcoming streaming service saying , `` we have no plans to go into music streaming . '' The Verge reports that Facebook has been in talks with major music labels , but says that there is no end-goal at this time . Original story follows ... While Facebook recently took on YouTube with its own video streaming platform , it looks like the social media giant is now gearing up to take on the likes of Apple Music and Spotify . Sources speaking to Music Ally say that Facebook has been in talks with music labels in a bid to launch its own music streaming service . But we might not see the service launch anytime soon as , according to the report , Facebook wants to get the monetization aspect of its new video platform ( which will give advertisers 55 % of ad revenue ) perfected before delving into a viable audio streaming business . This could end up having Facebook entering the music streaming game pretty late , considering how many services are already available . In the meantime , you might be seeing music videos popping up on Facebook in the next few months , as according to the sources , the social media giant is in `` advanced talks '' with music labels to get their music videos on Facebook . With such a strong user base ( and with direct access to fans ) this could end up being a stronger threat to YouTube . And with potential for a tied-in video platform , a Facebook music service could become a threat to the likes of Spotify and the recently launch Apple Music and Tidal .
Facebook is launching an update to its News Feed that 's all about giving you more control . This is a welcomed change because , as Facebook users know , there 's nothing worse than realizing you missed out on something important because it got buried under 20 cat-in-a-costume GIFs . These customizable options help to ensure that the content you actually want to see stays at the top of your News Feed , like stuff from close friends and family . As illustrated by cute little crabs with combovers , you can prioritize who on your friends list you 'd like to see first . The choices you select will appear on your News Feed with a blue star on the top right corner . On the other hand , Facebook is also making it easier for users to unfollow people or pages they just do n't want to see anymore . We all have friends we want to unfriend , but at the risk of making things awkward in real life , just end up settling on ignoring them . Now , it 's easier than ever to ex out all of their uncomfortable , self-deprecating posts . Facebook users , at least those who use the social media site on desktop , have been able to unfollow people and pages that they do n't want to see on their News Feed anymore . But this new update , available today on iOS , brings a visually slick way of doing so to the mobile crowd . It 's headed to the Android platform and desktop in the coming weeks .

Facebook design manager , Caitlin Winner , just quietly made Facebook icons more relevant to 50 % of the world 's population by updating key Facebook icons . Not only does the female silhouette look less like Darth Vader , she 's now been brought forward to take centre stage on group notifications . The female icon was also slightly pushed into the background in the friends notifications icon , but now both the man and woman are of equal size . Having had to reject the idea of a shoulder-to-shoulder icon , Winner , in her own words `` abandoned this approach after failing to make an icon that did n't look like a two headed mythical beast '' , and a new icon was born . The final iteration was uploaded to the Facebook servers , and very quietly rolled out without much fanfare . In a design blog , Winner states that the desire to change the world and make a positive impact to it was the inspiration behind the change . This being the internet , we 're sure that some pernickety people will react as if she redesigned them all in pink . Facebook recently highlighted its diversity efforts in a news blog . However , its ongoing refusal to let people use adopted names continues to draw criticism . Let 's hope that small changes like this ripple out from within . Facebook has much further to go on the diversity front than just changing one or two icons . Facebook videos are about to suck . A lot .

Watching videos have always been a pain on Facebook . Hover over one and it starts playing silently requiring you to unmute them every time . Try to scroll away and it stops running altogether forcing you to stick around for the whole thing . Well no more . Facebook has introduced a new feature that lets users detach videos from their news feed and move them about anywhere within the constraints of the browser window . Users can activate the new feature by hitting the newly added pop out button located on the video navigation bar , just between the high-definition toggle and full screen switch . Unfortunately , there are a few limitations including the fact that the floating window shrinks to a much smaller size compared to original video on newsfeeds . Similarly , the controls reduced to a single play/pause button with a Like and Share button . At the same time users will lose the options to change the volume or your place in the video . Any floating video windows will also disappear as soon as you leave the newsfeed for another section of the social network such as your messages or a friend 's profile page . So far , Facebook has confirmed it is rolling out the new feature quietly for a small group of users . `` We 've heard from some people that they 'd like to watch videos while they scroll through News Feed , '' a Facebook spokesperson confirmed with TechRadar . `` We 're running a small test where you can create a smaller floating screen , which continues playing the video while you scroll through your News Feed . '' While TechRadar staffers did n't have the floating feature yet , we created a composite for the lead image to simulate what a floating video would look like next to the Facebook newsfeed .

The internet 's a pretty sinful place , brimming with saucy selfies , vulgar vines , and hardcore ... er , you get the idea . Naturally , this adult content frequently finds its way onto Facebook , Instagram and their ilk , but a group of evangelical Christians in Brazil has launched a holy war against dropping social media standards . The group , located in Ferraz de Vasconcelos near Sao Paulo , is attempting to keep things holy by launching Facegloria , a social network with strict rules that prevent users from posting anything the Almighty might find on the nose . Restrictions apply to colourful language – 600 banned words and counting – sexual content , and depictions of violence . Homosexuality also gets the chop , with anything gay-related receiving a firm thumbs down . Sticking with the holy theme , Facegloria users do n't `` like '' posts , but say `` amen '' instead . Approximately 100,000 people are said to have signed up to Facegloria within its first month , and the network has a target of 10 million users within two years . We 'll have to wait and see if the site can succeed without the filth , controversy and bickering that draws people to other forms of social media every day .

There 's a rumour going around that Facebook wants to get in on the music streaming business . It 's a crowded market , and Apple Music has made sure that any future players will have to work extra hard to make a success of it , yet Zuck supposedly wants a slice of the pie . According to The Verge , Facebook is in some preliminary chats with major music labels , including Sony Music Entertainment , Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group . What Facebook intends to do with music is unclear . To its advantage it already has a 1.44 billion user base in place , a large chunk of which spend an average of 40 minutes a day on the site - although even that might not be enough to float another Spotify rival . It 's interesting , because Zuckerberg decided early on that Facebook was n't going to be like Myspace ; there would be no music and very little customisation . And , surprisingly , that worked . But I think there 's a huge opportunity for real artist engagement that Facebook has been slow to jump on . Myspace made it work for some time , and in some ways still does despite most of its old users defecting to pastures greener . Most of all , I think now 's the time for Facebook to bring back the Myspace music player . You remember that , right ? A small box that sat on your profile and played your song of choice whenever someone landed on your page . The Myspace music player was a way to express yourself through sound ; your choice of profile song said something about you , about how you were feeling in that moment . It was a breakup song , a song that said `` I 'm happy '' or `` I 'm sad '' or `` I have a girlfriend and I think it might actually work out this time '' . It might have been a song you heard on the radio that morning . Whatever it was , it was your theme tune . Sure , some people found it annoying , and there was nothing worse than forgetting your speakers were turned up to 11 the moment you found out Jeff had `` rediscovered '' Lightning Bolt . But it was just one element that made your profile page yours , along with the ability to change the actual layout - probably the only reason many of my generation have at least a bit of HTML knowledge . It was also good for artists : a band could break a new song on Myspace and within seconds people around the world could be playing it on their profile . Of course , if you were an artist yourself and trying to get some exposure , you could do the same . So whatever Facebook has planned , I hope it remembers that , despite its missteps , Myspace had a couple of decent ideas when it came to artist engagement . But really , I just want the ability to blast obscure Joy Division b-sides at anyone who visits my profile .

Facebook made headlines lately by striking exclusive video deals with companies like HBO , and now it 's gearing up to take its video platform a step further with video ads . The social media giant already has video ads on the News Feed , but Facebook plans to start squeezing ads in between video clips as well . When the feature rolls out , whenever you finish watching a video on Facebook , a `` Suggested videos '' screen will pop up . If you continue watching these videos , an ad will play after a few clips , similar to how YouTube runs ads after a few consecutive videos . It certainly looks like Facebook is serious about its video platform and wants to be a genuine competitor to YouTube . The new video ads will pay advertisers 55 % of the revenue , with 45 % going back to Facebook - just like YouTube 's set-up . But making more money is n't the only motivation for Facebook . Speaking to Recode , Dan Rose , Facebook 's VP of partnerships , said , `` A lot of [ our partners ] have said this will be a big motivation to start publishing a lot more video content to Facebook . '' So while we 'll were slammed with more ads , there will be more video content for us to binge on as well , and the social media giant already has deals in place with Fox Sports , the NBA and Funny or Die . There are no dates yet for when the ads will begin appearing .
Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg reckons that telepathy is the future of the social network . The site 's founder hosted a Q & A session on Facebook where he answered several queries from users and celebrities . One of the most interesting takeaways from the session was his thoughts on the future of social networking . `` One day , I believe we 'll be able to send full rich thoughts to each other directly using technology , '' he said . `` You 'll just be able to think of something and your friends will immediately be able to experience it too if you 'd like . '' Zuck added that `` we 'll have the power to share our full sensory and emotional experience with people whenever we 'd like . '' There was also a question regarding what Facebook is doing with artificial intelligence , to which Zuckerberg responded : `` Our goal is to build AI systems that are better than humans at our primary senses : vision , listening , etc . `` For vision , we 're building systems that can recognize everything that 's in an image or a video . This includes people , objects , scenes , etc . These systems need to understand the context of the images and videos as well as whatever is in them . '' For listening and language , we 're focusing on translating speech to text , text between any languages , and also being able to answer any natural language question you ask . '' A number of celebs `` dropped in '' for the Q & A including Arianna Huffington , Arnold Schwarzenegger ( who asked if the machines will win - Zuck said no ) and Stephen Hawking . But it was perhaps the question on Facebook 's real-name policy that people were most interested to see a response to . Currently , Facebook wo n't let people use adopted names , potentially putting some people - particularly transgender users - at risk of abuse . It 's a particularly important topic following the US Supreme Courts ruling in favour of marriage equality . `` There is some confusion about what our policy actually is , '' said Zuckerberg . `` Real name does not mean your legal name . Your real name is whatever you go by and what your friends call you . If your friends all call you by a nickname and you want to use that name on Facebook , you should be able to do that . '' `` In this way , we should be able to support everyone using their own real names , including everyone in the transgender community . We are working on better and more ways for people to show us what their real name is so we can both keep this policy which protects so many people in our community while also serving the transgender community . '' Although Zuckerberg said Facebook was working to improve matters , his response suggested that the policy would not be changing any time soon - the main reason being user safety , he said . `` We know that people are much less likely to try to act abusively towards other members of our community when they 're using their real names . There are plenty of cases - for example , a woman leaving an abusive relationship and trying to avoid her violent ex-husband - where preventing the ex-husband from creating profiles with fake names and harassing her is important . As long as he 's using his real name , she can easily block him . ''

Facebook reached a massive milestone this week , with Mark Zuckerberg announcing that a billion people logged onto the social networking site on Monday . That 's means one out of seven people on Earth used Facebook on a single day . `` This was the first time we reached this milestone , and it 's just the beginning of connecting the whole world , '' Zuckeberg wrote in a post today . This is especially impressive as there was no special event or holiday that might have pushed users to log in on Monday - there was just a lot of people using Facebook . Facebook received a lot of major updates this year , including a bigger push into videos , as well as live streaming . Facebook has also been pushing for a more connected world for a while now , with the company working on projects that include Internet.org , as well as a giant solar-powered plane built to deliver internet to remote areas of the world . `` A more open and connected world is a better world . It brings stronger relationships with those you love , a stronger economy with more opportunities , and a stronger society that reflects all of our values , '' Zuckerberg added in his post . `` Thank you for being part of our community and for everything you 've done to help us reach this milestone . I 'm looking forward to seeing what we accomplish together . ''

Facebook has announced M , a digital personal assistant that lives within the search giant 's Messenger app . M will be taking on the likes of Siri , Google Now , Cortana and Amazon 's Alexa , but Facebook says it has one feature that 's missing in its competitors . `` Unlike other AI-based services in the market , M can actually complete tasks on your behalf , '' Facebook VP David Marcus said in a Facebook post today . M will be able to answer your questions , but also complete tasks like ordering things online , booking restaurant reservations or even having gifts sent to family or friends . Interestingly , M will also have a more human component to it than the other AI-assistants currently available as well . `` It 's powered by artificial intelligence that 's trained and supervised by people , '' Marcus said . Facebook has n't explained how much of an involvement these people will have for those who use M on a daily basis , but we assume there will be a decent privacy policy accompanying it . Currently though , M is only beginning its testing phase . We 're keen to see how it will stack up against its better established competitors , and will be updating as we hear more .

Facebook a name for itself in the social media world with an excellent messaging and photo platform . Now , the social network plans to get very serious about its Events feature . During the company 's latest earnings call , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined a new plan to liven up Events . For starters , Facebook has already started experimenting with flagging events that are popular or ones that your friends are going to on the left and right side of the Newsfeed . Additionally , Facebook wants to introduce more notifications to keep users informed about the latest goings-ons around them as well . The Social Network is also considering how to change the way users interact with events by adding `` Follow '' or `` Remind me '' as non- committal way of showing their interest in an event . As it stands now , the only way to keep an event on your radar is to mark yourself as going or maybe attending . On top of giving users more options to stay attuned with events , there might be a greater distinction between public and private events more apparent . To this end public events will feature larger header images along with presenting more information about the location and event ( such as an artist 's profile or photos of the venue ) . As for private occasions , Facebook has started testing new cover art themes to add a bit of glamour for your party invitations . Starting today , users can choose between 36 themes including family , holiday and seasons . The new themes will be available first to Android users , after which iOS users will have access later on . In a smaller bit of related news , Facebook has also brought back Notes with a new design featuring sharper typography and larger images . Overall , the new look is very reminiscent of Medium , which should n't really come as a surprise after they hired the web publishing platform 's designers . The real question is whether users will use the newly minted Notes for blogging or will it fall to the wayside again for overly long status updates .

Update August 12 : Turns out Facebook 's Live streaming feature is coming to more than uber famous folk . Eventually , Facebook will open the Mentions app , where Live lives , to verified Profiles , as discovered by TechCrunch . Currently , Mentions is only available to some verified Pages . Verified Profiles tend to include slightly less famous people or those who do n't want a verified Page and simply maintain a Profile . As TechCrunch notes , opening up Mentions ( and by extension , Live ) will let more entertainers , athletes , politicians and even journalists broadcast to the world . Live is a Periscope rival with an ace up its sleeve : it creates a recording of streams that can stay on Pages in perpetuity . Periscope only makes recordings of broadcasts available for 24 hours after the stream ends . Original article below ... Facebook has introduced Live , a live video streaming service that allows you to see into the lives of well-known music superstars , athletes and influencers . It 's like Periscope , except you have to be this cool for Facebook to let you stream your own adventures . If you do happen to be someone famous , ( hi ! ) you 'll be able to stream video through Facebook Mentions , a companion app that supposedly makes getting in touch with other high-profile individuals and fans easier than it is through the core Facebook app . For everyone else , when a famous person you follow broadcasts a live video , it will show up on your News Feed like all other content surfaces on Facebook . If you are n't around for the live event , Facebook will add the video to that person 's page for viewing at a later time . Keep an eye out for your favorite celebrities and public figures to post a live video . If you need some live video to hold you over while you wait , Facebook encourages users to check out streams from Serena Williams , Martha Stewart , Michael Bublé .

Facebook is allegedly developing a new app that will send breaking news alerts straight to your phone . Business Insider reports that a source close to the matter has leaked screen shots of a proposed alert along with details about the app . You 'll be able to follow partnered outlets that will deliver alerts once news breaks . Only 100 character messages are allowed to be sent out , along with a link to the full news story . If it moves past the current Alpha stage eventually making it to consumers , you 'll essentially have to download another app associated with Facebook if you want the service . Though we 've all acclimated to Facebook Messenger as a standalone app , when it was first announced , people were not very happy about the forced download . However it 's still not clear how the app will officially work and whether you 'll have the option to download it or not . In fact , it might flop considering Facebook 's past projects . Anyone remember Paper ? It 's all but disappeared , so only time will tell how well this new app will turn out .

R.I.P . LOL - or at least that 's what Facebook is saying anyway , in a recent study conducted on the demographic of humour online . Facebook scanned posts in the USA during the final week in May this year , revealing how people `` laugh online '' - and how it varied by age and location . The study concluded that a simple `` haha '' is now more popular , claiming 51.4 % of instances in the study . Emojis came in as the second most popular form of `` e-laughing '' at 33 % , and `` hehe '' ranked third . Lol was a measly 1.9 % . Poor Lol . Emojis are more popular among younger folk , according to the study , while Facebook also found that females use more emojis than males . However , southern states of America still use LOL more than other areas . With all the cool kids turning their backs on original 'netspeak ' in favour of emoticons , maybe we 're seeing a shift to a more visual form of communication . Why use words when a picture will do just as well ? As language reflects the ever-changing shift in how generations use technology , this wo n't be the last change we 'll see in the linguistic landscape . Soon , in the age of brainscanning , people wo n't need words or pictures , they 'll just be communicating directly with thoughts through brain-scanning caps . * winky face *
Facebook has added the ability to forward photos to your friends within messages on the web , TechRadar has discovered . Click on a photo ( sent by you or a friend ) in a message thread and a Forward option appears next to the Download option on the enlarged image . A blue notification bubble that read `` Send this image to other people in separate messages '' popped up when we first selected a photo . Selecting Forward pulls up a seemingly random selection of 20 friends . You can select one , some or all of them , or search for friends or groups to pass the photo along to . We were able to select up to 20 friends to forward a photo to in all . The ability to forward a photo within the Messenger mobile app has been around for a while , but now it 's come to messages on the web browser version of Facebook . Two US-based TechRadar staffers had the forward option as of late Sunday night . We 've asked Facebook for more information on photo forwarding within messages , including how widespread it is , and will update this story when we learn more .

Facebook is playing dirty in its quest to be a bigger video platform than YouTube , according to popular vlogging star Hank Green . Green , who makes up one half of the Blogbrothers , a video duo who have racked up more than 552 million views , has published a blog post called 'Theft , Lies , and Facebook Video ' , which criticises Facebook 's behaviour when it comes to video . Green complains that Facebook not only promotes natively posted videos more so than embedded YouTube videos , but also exaggerates the number of viewers . `` A SciShow YouTube video embedded on Facebook will reach between 20,000 and 50,000 people and be viewed by hundreds of people , '' writes Green . `` The same video uploaded natively will get a reach of between 60,000 and 150,000 and be 'viewed ' by tens of thousands . '' Green says that what constitutes as a video `` view '' on Facebook is much different to YouTube . He claims that a video need only be watched for three seconds to count as a `` view '' on the big blue social network , while on YouTube it 's thirty seconds . `` At that moment , 90 % of people scrolling the page are still 'watching ' this silent animated GIF . But by 30 seconds , when viewership actually could be claimed , only 20 % are watching . 90 % of people are being counted , but only 20 % of people are actually 'viewing ' the video . '' Green 's big problem is with `` freebooting '' , a process where people rip videos from YouTube and then natively post them to Facebook . In his blog post , Green quotes an earlier report from Ogilvy and Tubular Labs that claimed out of the 1000 most popular Facebook videos of Q1 2015 , 725 were re-uploads . As Green argues , Facebook is n't doing enough to solve this problem . `` They 'll take the video down a couple days after you let them know . Y'know , once it 's received 99.9 % of the views it will ever receive . '' Facebook 's response to pirated videos is to eventually take them down , but Google has a better solution : its `` Content ID '' system lets it analyse uploaded videos and ensure that revenues are fairly paid to the original rights holders . Why does n't Facebook have a similar tool in its utility belt ? That 's the question Green is asking , and Facebook 's response is essentially `` We 're listening and trying to make things better '' . Matt Pakes , a Facebook project manager , defended Facebook 's method of promoting its own videos , claiming that users are more likely to engage with a natively uploaded clip . You can read the full response here .

Having recently told Russian Facebook users to leave the social network over its blocking of Russia ’ s telecommunications regulator , the Russian government is taking its beef with the site even further , as it ’ s considering blocking it entirely over its use of gay emoji . Russian senator Mikhail Marchenko has called for the government to investigate whether Facebook ’ s same-sex emoji are in direct violation of the country ’ s ‘ homosexual propaganda ’ laws which were established in 2013 . In his appeal to Russia 's Roskomnadzor ( Federal Service For Supervision of Communication , Information Technology and Mass Media ) , Marchenko stated that “ these emoji of non-traditional sexual orientation are seen by all users of the social network , a large portion of whom are minors , ” and that “ propaganda of homosexuality is banned under the laws and under the pillars of tradition that exist here in our country . ” Though access to similar emoji on Twitter and in Apple ’ s own emoji section is readily available , the appeal makes no mention of these services , instead choosing to focus its attention on Facebook . It could work , too – Roskomnadzor is believed to have closed down over 10,000 sites in Russia so far , and even managed to push Google and Intel out of the country entirely in 2014 for failing to comply with Russia ’ s blogger laws .

Mark Zuckerberg might have 1.49 billion users to his name and a new baby on the way , but he 's not going to stop experimenting with what Facebook can do : and the newest innovation is live event streaming . As the Wall Street Journal reports , users in the US can visit the Lollapalooza event page to see photos , videos , posts and updates from the festival , both from friends who are there and bands and artists . `` This Lollapalooza experience is just one of the many ways Facebook is trying to help people get the feel of an event when they 're not there , '' Facebook told the WSJ in a statement . The new feature builds on the Place Tips screen Facebook introduced in January - that 's the page that shows you relevant photos and reviews from friends whenever you check into a place . The 'live ' aspect is new , though . Of course this is a lot like the Our Story feature that Snapchat has , where you can tap into live events and distant locations to see what 's happening . Facebook says it 's offering differs by including content from your actual friends . Whatever your opinion of Facebook , you ca n't accuse it of resting on its laurels - the company is busy getting into artificial intelligence , news publishing , internet drones and of course virtual reality just in case the old social networking strategy does n't work out .

Facebook has a real focus on video right now , and has today introduced the ability to create looping videos - which is basically like a GIF - to use as your profile 'picture ' . `` Soon , you 'll be able to film a short , looping video clip that will play for anyone who visits your profile , '' the company said in its announcement . You can take the video , which lasts about 7 seconds , through the Facebook mobile app . The video will play in a silent loop until you click ( or tap ) it and it actually reminds us of the moving photos from the Harry Potter movies . Facebook is also letting you add `` temporary version of your profile picture '' which will revert back to your usual profile picture after a specified time . Examples include a temporary image while you 're on vacation , or supporting a sports team for the big game over the weekend in what Facebook is calling `` a visual status update . '' The social media giant is also giving users better control , allowing you to customize the information shown at the top of your profile page on mobile , including choosing up to five Featured Photos . It 's also added a new 'Bio ' field , which is one sentence long and is similar to the bio field in Twitter and Instagram . Photos and videos are also getting featured more prominently on mobile , with profile pictures to be centered and made bigger , and photos and friends to be place right at the top of profiles as well . Facebook says the new features will be available to a small group of iPhone users in the UK and California , and will be rolled out to more users soon .

Update September 28 : Aaand Facebook is back . The social media site is recovering from an outage where it served up an error message to users for the second time since September 24 and the third time in less than two weeks . We received this comment from a Facebook spokesperson at 1:12pm PT when we asked what caused this most recent outage : `` We 're currently restoring Facebook services that people had trouble accessing earlier today due to a configuration issue . We 're working to bring things back to normal for everyone . We apologize to those who have been inconvenienced . '' From New York to San Francisco to the UK , users were without their Facebook fix . Though the service hobbled back in those areas ( according to techradar staffers ' own checks ) , some on Twitter said they are still unable to access the site . Even restored service was shaky , though by 2:29pm PT the site seemed to be functioning normally once more . This has n't been a good month for Facebook as far as outages are concerned : the first occurred on September 17 , followed by one late last week and now again today . None of the outages have lasted very long ( thank goodness ) . Still , Facebook probably wants to check its servers - or whatever keeps our News Feeds running - if it 's experiencing total-site meltdowns this frequently . Original post from September 24 below ... Facebook was down , at least at for a few minutes today , which is a rare event in the young life of Mark Zuckerberg 's social networking website . The homepage was inaccessible with a brief error message of `` Sorry , something went wrong , '' followed by `` We 're working on it and we 'll get it fixed as soon as we can . '' That started appearing on our web browser and the mobile app at 9:25am PDT , 12:25pm PDT , and 5:25pm BST . Facebook 's billion users may have also encountered a `` Service Unavailable '' error message , which we found when trying to refresh the page too many times during the Facebook outage . We 've reached out to Facebook about the ongoing problems and will report back if they respond , but everything returned to normal for us at around at 9:47am , 12:47pm PDT , and 5:47pm BST . Now that it 's back , check out Facebook 's new Star Wars 360-degree video , which is the first of its kind or watch the Facebook-owned Oculus Rift press conference livestream happening now .
It might often feel like snarky comments about politics on Facebook have no effect on the real world . But the inverse is actually true , according to a team of political science researchers at the University of Delaware led by Paul Brewer . They created a Facebook page for a fictitious candidate and populated it with basic , non-partisan information about him , then sent the page to 183 people alongside an online survey . Some saw a page with two fake supportive comments . Others saw a page with two challenging comments . When asked their opinions of the candidate , those who 'd seen positive comments had a more favourable perception and were more likely to support him . Those who saw negative comments had more unfavourable perceptions . Interestingly , whether or not the candidate responded to the comments had no effect on how he was perceived . `` This showed that people trust comments from their peers more than they trust self-generated comments from the candidate , '' Brewer said . `` It 's the idea that what other people say about you is genuine , perhaps unlike what you say about yourself . So comments from some random person on the internet do shape citizens ' perceptions . '' He added : `` I was surprised that no one had done this kind of study before , at least not in published research . '' The results of the study were published in the Journal of Experimental Political Science .

Facebook had previously hinted at some changes for its oft-ignored Notes tool , and now those changes are rolling out across the site and mobile apps . Essentially , your Notes now look like Medium-esque blog posts . `` Notes are now an even better way to write a longer post and share with anyone - whether it 's a small group of friends or everyone on Facebook , '' writes Facebook User Interface Engineer Isaac Salier-Hellendag . Users get more stylish font formatting options as well as the opportunity to add a large cover photo at the top of the post . Photos , headers and lists can all be included too . The feature is rolling out to everyone on the network right now and you can check if your account has received the upgrade yet by logging in and heading to www.facebook.com/notes . For those of you with long memories , it 's something of a retro turn for social media : at the start of the 2000s , blogs were the original profiles , made popular by networks such as LiveJournal and Blogger . If you 're stuck for inspiration , Facebook suggests recapping your summer holiday , voicing your opinion on something in the news or sharing a recipe with your friends .

It 's harder than ever in 2015 to go through a tough breakup . For some reason , there 's a compulsion to stalk your ex on social media - a compulsion which has now been comprehensively analysed by psychologists . Jesse Fox and Robert Tokunaga surveyed 431 university students ( 150 male , 281 female ) who 'd experienced a breakup in the past year where both of the former partners were on Facebook . They were asked a series of questions about attachment , investment , commitment , distress , and post-breakup stalking on social media . The results , published in the journal Cyberpsychology , Behavior and Social Networking , showed that the more distressing the breakup , the more post-breakup stalking ( or `` interpersonal electronic surveillance '' , as the researchers call it ) took place - particularly for those who did n't initiate the breakup . It also had a knock-on effect in terms of monitoring of current partners . `` Social network sites can serve as virtual scrapbooks for relationships , as they serve as an anthology of past posts , interactions , and photos shared on the site , '' the researchers wrote . `` Viewing one 's own content may promote reflection or rumination about the breakup , which is associated with prolonged emotional distress , particularly for anxiously attached individuals . '' They added : `` Another possibility is that users spend time investigating the ex-partner 's new romantic interest and engaging in social comparison , which may lead to negative affect . Given their affordances , social media are discussed as potentially unhealthy enablers for online surveillance after relationship termination . '' So next time you 're going through a nasty breakup , stay off Facebook , yeah ?
Back in May , Facebook launched an Internet.org Platform initiative that let third-party developers get on board with the project - it meant other software makers could plug their wares into Mark Zuckerberg 's grand vision . Now the Internet.org Platform is live and open for business , and it 's got a new name at the same time : `` Free Basics by Facebook '' . The scheme as a whole is still called Internet.org so make sure you get your terms right when discussing all this next to the office watercooler . `` Today , more than 60 new services are available across the 19 countries where free basic services are available , '' explains the Internet.org blog post . `` Not only does this expand the range of resources available to people , it gives them more choice and control over the services they can use in the app and website . '' A couple of the early third-party apps included are SmartBusiness , for helping people launch their own enterprises , and BabyCenter , which includes vital health information about pregnancy and parenting . If you 're completely bamboozled by all of this , Internet.org is Facebook 's initiative to get the developing world online using low-cost smartphones . Some services are available free of charge ( hence `` Free Basics '' ) , paid for by Facebook 's carrier partners and the premium options people can choose to upgrade to once they get connected . The plan has had its fair share of critics who think Facebook just wants more people signed up for its social network and locked into the Facebook ecosystem . This extending of the platform to other developers and apps is part of a response to that criticism .

Facebook has joined YouTube in offering 360-degree videos to the masses - and there 's a brand new clip from Star Wars : The Force Awakens to help show off the newly launched feature .. As the name suggests , 360-degree videos let you peer in any direction while the action unfolds . You can view them in a VR headset , but they also work in web browsers ( if you click and drag to view ) and on standard smartphones ( swipe or move the handset around ) . It 's like a basic version of virtual reality , though you ca n't control your position in the scene and there 's no depth perception ( you feel like you 're in a round bubble rather than an actual world ) . Content publishers like Facebook are positioning 360-degree video as a way into VR for consumers while we wait for the Oculus Rift , HTC Vive and other headsets to launch next year . It 's relatively easy to make too . As for the new Star Wars clip , it lets you explore the parched surface of Jakku on a speeder and fly past a Star Destroyer sunk in the sand . It 's an impressive use of the new tech and shows what 's possible - click and drag to move the point of view around . The 360-degree videos are rolling out in the News Feed on desktop and Android now with iOS support coming soon . In the not too distant future you 'll be able to peer in any direction inside your friends ' holiday and baby videos ( assuming they have a 360-degree camera , of course ) .

Facebook has announced that 360-degree videos will begin rolling out in News Feeds starting today . Rumors that Facebook would be launching the new video feature popped up last week , though it was suggested then that the feature would be launched through a standalone app . Instead , the social media giant today launched the feature as part of its video offering , which means 360-degree videos will available right on your New Feed . As part of the announcement , a number of companies have launched 360-degree videos , including a 360 experience from Star Wars : The Force Awakens that was made exclusively for Facebook , which you can view here . The video , for anyone interested , has you speed across the Jakku desert from the upcoming movie . Other 360-degree videos that are available to watch right now on Facebook include Saturday Night Live , VICE and GoPro , among others . By adding 360-degree videos , Facebook is playing a bit of catch up with Google , as 360-degree videos have been available on YouTube since earlier this year . `` In the future , imagine watching 360 videos of a friend 's vacation to a small village in France or a festival in Brazil - you 'll be able to look around and experience it as if you were there , '' Facebook said , so we imagine the feature wo n't be available to just professional content makers . You 'll be able to see the new immersive videos on Facebook through the web or on Android devices , with the feature to be rolled out to iOS in `` the coming months . '' Facebook says that on the web , you can drag your cursor within the video screen to view the different video angles , while on mobile , you can move around the video by dragging your finger in the direction you want . And like with other 360-degree videos available on phones , Facebook says you can also `` hold up your phone , and the 360 video will follow you as you turn , looking around , to experience things from all over the world like never before .

Mark Zuckerburg and company have been a bit ambiguous as to how exactly it will employ a new empathy button , a newly uncovered patent suggests it could be as simple as emojis . Filed on December 23 , 2014 , the Facebook patent illustrates a small selection of emojis sit alongside Facebook 's iconic like button . From the patent illustration , it seems like emoting would open up more options for users to respond with a smiling , dour or other funny faces . Zuckerberg first announced on Tuesday that Facebook would integrate a way for users to express empathy . The Social Network founder explained a dislike button would be too simple and create a culture of up and down voting – not unlike Reddit . Although Facebook has already implemented an emoji-like with stickers , the system is a bit cumbersome with so many options and it requires users to post them in a message . If this patent proves to be more than a concept , a small subset of emoticons could be a faster way of capturing users ' reactions to complex topics such as the republican debate or the refuge crisis in Syria . Facebook will begin public testing soon , so we could see a new set of emoji-like options appear next to the usual thumbs up button . via The Next Web

Facebook is finally ready to let more people onto its Facebook at Work social network designed specifically for enterprises and businesses . First reported by Re/code , the closed beta trial of the service that has been open since January is ready to give way to a freemium version of the office-based social network before the year is out , according to Julien Codroniou , head of Facebook at Work . At its heart , the service lets companies create their own social networks using Facebook 's familiar technology and its popularity is likely to depend on users knowing what they see and more importantly liking it . More than 100 companies have been using the product as part of the closed beta and it 's a number that is continuing to expand . Encouragingly for Facebook , early adopters have already started to expand its use internally . Taking Heineken as an example , testing was restricted to 40 of its top executives in the first instance but by the end of September it will be used by all 550 of its US-based employees . There 's no lack of competition in the social enterprise collaboration space with the likes of Microsoft 's Yammer ( and Delve ) , Podio , Huddle , Salesforce 's Chatter and a number of others jostling for position .

The story taking the internet by storm today involves a budding 14-year-old engineer from Texas who was arrested for making a clock and bringing it to school . Ahmed Mohamed was promptly taken to the principal 's office and grilled by police officers who wanted to determine whether he was trying to make a bomb . Mohamed adamantly insisted to each person who asked that it was simply a homemade clock . The teen 's story has inspired invitations from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to visit the company 's Menlo Park campus : `` Having the skill and ambition to build something cool should lead to applause , not arrest . The future belongs to people like Ahmed ... if you ever want to come by Facebook , I 'd love to meet you . Keep building . '' The situation has n't gone unnoticed by the White House either , with President Obama chiming in as well : `` Cool clock , Ahmed . Want to bring it to the White House ? We should inspire more kids like you to like science . It 's what makes America great . '' Democratic Presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even had some words about the situation : `` Assumptions and fear do n't keep us safe - they hold us back . Ahmed , stay curious and keep building . '' Various NASA astronauts , Google , Reddit and Twitter are a few other big names reaching out and showing support , while the hashtag # IStandWithAhmed has taken over the Twitterverse . Despite the unfortunate situation , it looks like this kid has a bright future ahead of him . Top image via Dallas Morning News
Some of you may have noticed that Facebook is trailing a new `` read receipt '' feature for events , letting you see which of your invitees have looked at the invitation . Some of you might also be asking the same question that I am : why ? The pilot scheme is only affecting a select number of users right now , meaning there 's a chance it may never roll out to the masses - but why anyone would want this feature is beyond me . All it does is give cause for never opening another event invitation in fear that I might not be able to conjure a believable 'get out ' excuse fast enough . Less than 10 minutes and it might pass the test , but over an hour ? Yeah , good luck convincing them with that one , pal . Let 's face it : read receipts do more harm than good , especially when it comes to messaging . I 'm not saying we should all go back to mailing letters , but modern communications are fast enough . Read receipts enforce absolute immediacy , turning the simple activity of messaging ( and now events ) into a psychological minefield . `` He read it an hour ago - why has n't he responded yet ? '' `` Why did she say she was asleep when I CLEARLY saw she read my message at 2:55 '' `` I swear I just saw the typing bubble but now it 's gone . Screw you , Gary , get out of my head '' It works both ways . Sometimes I 'll read a Facebook message but wo n't respond until later in the day , and the space between these two moments is filled with flickers of guilt . I can feel the person silently analysing me from afar because I know I 'd be doing the same . When you break it down , it 's a power thing . Letting people see when you 've read their messages means you have the upper hand in the exchange . Sure , they probably did n't reply for 10 minutes because they were feeding the cat , but you ? You read that message and then just walked away , and now you 're dangling the hard truth right in front of their face . You utter , utter bastard . So I 'm asking Facebook to kill this idea before it properly gets out of the gate , and for the rest of you I 'm making a heartfelt plea : let 's all turn off read receipts wherever possible and live in blissful ignorance , never having to confront the hard truth that sometimes people just do n't care about us that much .
Facebook is about to get a lot less likeable thanks to the planned introduction of a `` dislike button , '' and I 'm none too happy about it , even if I get the point . As CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged today , `` People have asked about the 'dislike ' button for many years , and probably hundreds of people have asked about this . '' But resistance to the downward-facing hand gesture is futile , as the social media giant finally gave in to its own self-generated mob . A dislike button prototype is `` very close to shipping . '' Here 's why I think this grumpy cat-equivalent button is n't a good idea , while fully getting the irony that I 'm sounding negative about negativity . The 80s had big hair , the 90s had grunge and boy bands , the 2000s had reality television and the 2010s currently has cynicism . Like we need more of that ! Facebook is playing right into the hands of this snarkiest generation in history , motivating twenty and thirty-year-old millennials to downvote posts without ever reading beyond the headline . The `` everything is wrong with the world , and I want to let it be known '' attitude is pervasive on the connected internet . Meanwhile authentic positivity is rare outside of feels-good , lazy liking and resharing , the kind that makes people think , `` I reshared this , so good things are going to happen . I did my part . '' A majority of millennials ( I 'm included in that generation - barely ) , probably want to `` dislike '' this very article . Negatory . Facebook has n't quite launched its dislike button yet . `` Why the heck would someone dislike my high school graduation photos from 13 years ago ? ! '' It 's going to happen . You 're going to hear complaints like this , as common as today 's `` swipe right '' phrase . Everyone from your prank-loving friend to that person you have n't heard from in several years is going to be out to prod and poke ( not the old-school Facebook poke , either ) at your posts . There 's nothing wrong with dissenting opinion , but when it 's used as a mischievous weapon , it 's going to become a burden that interrupts your newsfeed stream ( and phone notifications ) with undeserved negativity . Imagine posting a new profile picture , and instead of being able to delete that one negative comment in a sea of compliments , there 's a lone dislike . `` A dislike button allows me to voice disapproval without having to type , '' said Juan Martinez , our TechRadar Pro Senior Editor , and that 's a fair point . `` If someone writes , 'my lizard died , ' I want to reach out to them , but I do n't want to write words . '' But if my lizard dies , I want to hear from Juan and everyone else , not rack up dislikes . By Facebook introducing a dislike button , it spurs a new form laziness . It 's a shallow way to show feeling without ever expressing true empathy . The `` like button '' had the same effect when it was introduced in 2009 , five years after `` The Facebook '' was founded in 2004 . Hopefully Zuckerberg and company find a way to remedy unwarranted dislikes and social media malaise , no matter what form the button eventually takes . But if it does n't work out , I know a guy with two sideways-pointing thumbs who is going to say `` I told you so . ''

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the company is hard at work on a `` dislike '' button . Users have long been able to like posts that they feel positively about , but have n't had a one-click avenue to express their distaste . Zuckerberg stated during a Q & A session that `` people have asked about the 'dislike ' button for many years , and probably hundreds of people have asked about this , and today is a special day because today is the day that I actually get to say we are working on it , and are very close to shipping a test of it . '' The social media company , which has been hard at work on ambitious ventures such as getting into drones and virtual reality with the Oculus Rift , has struggled back and forth with whether to actually introduce the `` dislike '' button to the masses for obvious reasons . Namely , Zuckerberg stated in the Q & A that `` we do n't want to turn Facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people 's posts . '' He also took a moment to defend Facebook 's current feedback structure , saying that introducing an upvote/downvote dynamic to users `` does n't seem like the kind of community that we want to create : You do n't want to go through the process of sharing some moment that was important to you in your day and have someone 'downvote ' it . '' Basically , Facebook does n't want you to troll people with the new `` dislike '' button , but to rather use it to `` express empathy , '' as Zuckerberg stated . I feel like I know how this will pan out already . Via CNBC

Facebook may be looking to get the world ready for virtual reality with a new report suggesting the company is working on an app for 360-degree videos . Sources 'familiar with the matter ' have told the Wall Street Journal that the social media giant is preparing a standalone app that supports spherical videos and would work on both Apple and Android handsets . Like with other 360-degree video platforms for phones and tablets , like those that works with Google Cardboard , users will be able to move their phone around to get a full 360-degree experience . The app is reportedly still in its early development stage , so it might not ever launch , but given that Mark Zuckerberg announced back in March that Facebook would begin supporting 360-degree videos on user 's News Feeds , we 're inclined to believe that we may end up seeing the app eventually . After all , Facebook has recently been pushing into the video streaming market , as well as taking big steps into VR with the purchase of Oculus last year . Google has already introduced 360-degree videos on YouTube , with VR headset-ready videos are expected to be supported soon , as well .

You 're perhaps familiar with the idea of changing your Facebook profile picture to support a specific cause or event : gay marriage , cancer research , your mate 's stag do , and so on . Facebook has noticed the trend and wants to help - the social media behemoth is testing out a new feature that lets you set a temporary profile picture that expires after a set number of hours , days or weeks . The idea is that the picture automatically reverts back to the original profile image without you having to remember to change it - your rainbow-coloured portrait will only appear for as long as it 's relevant , in other words . TechCrunch spotted the newly introduced option , which is available now to a select group of testers , and says it could roll out to more people in future . Or , it might get canned completely . `` We often see people use their profile pictures to support a cause , root for a team , and commemorate milestones like birthdays and anniversaries , '' said Facebook in an emailed statement to TechCrunch . `` Today , we 're testing a new feature that allows you to set a temporary profile picture for a specified period of time . Temporary profile pictures make it easier to to express who you are and how you 're feeling at a given moment , without having to worry about changing your profile picture back later . '' Get behind a worthy cause or celebrate your local team 's sporting success in even fewer clicks - what 's not to like ?

Facebook has figured out why it 's iOS app has been draining your iPhone 's battery , and thankfully , it 's fixed the problems in a new update . The company had said last week that it was investigating claims from users that the app was draining user 's batteries more than usual , but today the social media giant has revealed what exactly the issue was . `` The first issue we found was a 'CPU spin ' in our network code , '' Facebook 's Ari Grant said in a post . `` A CPU spin is like a child in a car asking , 'Are we there yet ? Are we there yet ? Are we there yet ? ' with the question not resulting in any progress to reaching the destination , '' he explain , adding that this repeated processing was causes the app to use more battery . The second issue was caused by the way Facebook 's in-app videos handles audio . `` If you leave the Facebook app after watching a video , the audio session sometimes stays open as if the app was playing audio silently , '' Grant said . `` This is similar to when you close a music app and want to keep listening to the music while you do other things , except in this case it was unintentional and nothing kept playing . '' He explained that because it remained awake in the background , even though it was n't actually doing anything , it continued to pull on the phone 's battery . Grant also noted that battery issues does n't appear to have anything to do with Facebook 's location-based features or location history . Hopefully the new update fixes the battery drain issues for users , and though Grant did n't say there are other issues still causing your battery life to struggle , he did say , `` We are committed to continuing to improve the battery usage of our app and you should see improvements in the version released today .

Facebook has announced today that it is expanding its search feature to include all 2 trillion posts made by users across the social network . Previously , search was limited to friends , groups and places , but it has now expanded include everyone on the social network , including strangers . Like Google , you can search trending topics or terms by using the search bar on its website or through Facebook 's mobile app , and when you type something into the bar , Facebook will suggest popular search terms or phrases as well . The results will include articles , which leverages its new Instant Articles feature , as well as quotes , videos , comments and related posts from your friends , groups and now , any of Facebook 's 1.5 billion users . Of course , if you do n't want a random stranger seeing a post about your embarrassing love for old Spice Girl songs , then you can easily go into your privacy settings and change the 'Who can see my future posts ? ' option from Public to Friends . Even when you begin typing into the search bar , Facebook explained suggestions will include popular phrases of things that are currently happening , giving users a way to quickly see what is happening and , of course , get involved with the conversation . Facebook says that the new search function will also let you get involved with an `` interesting public conversation '' quickly , similar in many ways that Twitter has been able to draw in worldwide public discussions on trending topics , like the boy who was arrested for bringing a home-made clock to school getting attention from the likes of President Barack Obama and NASA on Twitter . `` When a link gets shared widely on Facebook , it often anchors an interesting public conversation , '' Facebook said . `` With one tap , you can find public posts about a link , see popular quotes and phrases mentioned in these posts , and check out an aggregate overview of sentiment . '' The new expanded search will initially be available for Facebook users with the US English settings on desktop , iOS and Android . You can check out a video of the new search in action on Facebook 's post about the new features .

Facebook 's Instant Article , which brings news stories straight to your News Feed , if finally rolling out to mobile today , starting with its iOS app . So while you 'll finally be able to catch all the latest news right within the Facebook app on your iPhone and iPad , you might have already seen the feature before as Instant Article had actually launched earlier this year on desktop . Instant Articles for Android has also launched in public beta today , with a full roll out scheduled for later this year . Facebook also announced that the Instant Articles feature has new news partners as well , including the New York Times , NBC News , The Atlantic , MTV , Slate , Cosmopolitan , The Huffington Post and the Washington Post . They will be joining previously announced partners BBC , Guardian , Buzzfeed and National Geographic . The social media giant says it will also be adding a lot more partners as well in the coming weeks , including Billboard , CBS News , Cracked , E ! News , Fox Sports , Harper 's Bazaar , Mashable , NBA , The Onion , Pop Sugar , Rolling Stone , Time , Variety and The Weather Channel . You can see the full list on Facebook 's announcement . With Instant Articles coming to the iPhone and iPad this week , we imagine Apple 's new News app will end up facing some competition from Facebook users , considering it 'd be easier to get your news reading done while you 're on your News Feed checking out what your friends and family are up to rather than opening up a whole different app . Facebook also has the added benefit of showing you articles from publishers you already follow , or those that are shared by your friends , while Apple needs to seek permission to gather info about the kinds of articles you might be interested . For users on Facebook , Instant Articles will be shown on your News Feed with a lightning bolt next to them and when you tap a story , the social media giant says article will load 10 times faster than a standard mobile web browser , making for a faster and `` richer reading experience . '' So while it thankfully cuts out the ads you might see on a typical article on your phone , Instant Articles still retains images , the ability to comment , videos and even interactive maps , and you can view all the features of an article by either scrolling , swiping or even tilting your phone in some instances .

Facebook is now going to give you a warning if it suspects that your account has been attacked by someone working for a government - any government . The company wrote on its Security page that it will notify you if your Facebook account `` has been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working on behalf of a nation-state . '' And as an extra measure , it will also suggest you turn on Login Approvals , which sends you a special security code whenever you , or someone else , tries to access your account from a new device or browser , as well as re-securing all your other accounts , like email , etc . While Facebook said that it wo n't be specifying exactly how it is able to determine that a government is backing an attack on your account , it explained that it would only send you the warning notification `` only in situations where the evidence strongly supports our conclusion . '' `` While we have always taken steps to secure accounts that we believe to have been compromised , we decided to show this additional warning if we have a strong suspicion that an attack could be government-sponsored , '' said Alex Stamos , Facebook 's chief security officer , said in the post . `` We do this because these types of attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others , and we strongly encourage affected people to take the actions necessary to secure all of their online accounts . '' Of course , Facebook was also quick to point out that these types of attacks do n't compromise Facebook 's own security , and that if it does send out a warning to you , it could mean instead that your computer or device may have malware . Either way , it is an interesting type of warning option given we live in the time of NSA surveillance controversies . Perhaps Edward Snowden might consider joining Facebook now .

Facebook has confirmed that it is currently investigating claims that its iOS app is causing a significant amount of battery drain . Reports of the battery drain began cropping up earlier this week , with one user , entrepreneur Matt Gilligan , explaining in a blog post that Facebook 's iOS app was causing up to 15 % of battery drain over a 7 day period . Interestingly , in Gilligan 's situation , he had the background app refresh option switched off for Facebook , yet it was still running for 3.4 hours in the background over those 7 days . Another user on MacRumors saw Facebook responsible for 39 % of their iPhone 's battery life , with the app running for more than 8 hours in the background despite having the background app refresh off as well . So while it seems like the problem lays with a bug that is causing the Facebook iOS app to continue working in the background even with the background app refresh switch off , it 's unclear exactly what is causing this bug . Thankfully , though , Facebook says it 's looking into the issue . `` We have heard reports of some people experiencing battery issues with our iOS app , '' the social media giant said in a statement to TechCrunch . `` We 're looking into this and hope to have a fix in place soon . '' We 'll be getting in touch with Facebook , and we 'll report back if we hear back from them .

Facebook is continuing its push into the video world , announcing today that it 's begun testing a video hub right inside of its own offerings . The social media giant says the new dedicated video section will be accessible via a tab on the iPhone app or on the left side of the page near the Favorites section if you 're on the web . The new section will be for `` people to go when they exclusively want to watch video - whether that 's videos they 've saved for later , or videos from friends , Pages they follow , and other video publishers on Facebook , '' the company said . If you think it sounds a little like YouTube , you would n't be wrong , and with Facebook saying that it 'll help people with discovery , expect suggestions to be powered by the info you 've shared with Facebook . `` This new videos section helps people discover , watch and share videos on Facebook that are relevant to them , '' the social media giant said . You may not end up seeing the new video section yet , though , as Facebook is only testing it on a small scale right now . Facebook also had a few more video-related announcements , including other features it 's testing and rolling out as well . The social media giant has already rolled out a suggested content section for iOS , similar to YouTube 's suggestion section , and it 's set to begin rolling it out to the web , with Android to follow in the coming months . The floating videos windows that was spotted earlier this year is still being tried out as well , with the company saying , `` we 're testing a way for people to watch a video in a floating screen while simultaneously multitasking on Facebook . '' Facebook is also testing the ability to save videos to watch later , a feature it mentioned will be available in the new dedicated video section . While Facebook is still only testing a lot of these features , we 're curious to see how much of a pull it will have against YouTube . Either way , one thing is clear : Facebook has a battle plan to truly take on YouTube , and it 's putting it into place .
Has Facebook 's On This Day feature ever cropped up a bad memory or a photo of someone you 'd rather forget ? Well , smartly , Facebook has introduced filters for what could be a time capsule from days better left in the past , letting you filter out certain people or certain dates , or even periods of time . `` Your memories are yours , so you should control which ones you see in On This Day , '' a new pop-up message reads when you click on preferences for the feature . If you 've so far stayed away from the feature since it launched in March , On This Day surfaces status updates , photos , posts from friends and other items you 've shared or been tagged in on any particular day onto your News Feed , like when you became friends with someone on Facebook or a major life event . Now , you can choose to keep certain people from cropping up by typing in their name or selecting dates to keep posts from that time period from surprising you , too . `` Use these filters to help make sure we show you memories from On This Day in a way that 's meaningful for you , '' the new filter reads . It 's a nice little update that lets you finally take control of what Facebook resurfaces and , of course , you 're still in control of re-sharing with friends and families . Now go forth safely with your chosen selective memory .

What you are about to read has been penned by Mr Biffo , the creative force behind the 90s Teletext videogames magazine Digitiser . He now runs the show at digitiser2000.com . Facebook may no longer be the newest and most exciting method of remote quasi-interaction with our friends and family , but being one of the oldest it 's now something literally everyone uses . Unfortunately , this means that literally everyone is on there – for better or for worse . Here are the ten Facebook friends which all of us have , which we should probably think about getting rid of . There 's always one person on every Facebook feed who posts troubling , open-ended updates , yet never really explains what they 're about – no matter how many times people ask what 's wrong . `` Right . That 's the last time I trust a biplane pilot ! `` … and `` Never having chemo again ! `` … or just a simple `` FML ! Wyverns ! `` . `` Oh no ! What 's wrong , hun ? ! '' we all ask , while she sits back , silently scooping up those comments with her massive , positive affirmation fishing net , like the big , attention-trawling , black hole of emotions that she is . You got the friend request and message at the same time : `` How are things ? You remember me from school do n't you ? '' . And so you reply : `` Yes , of course I remember you – you are that familiar person from school '' . But you are not familiar with them . This one simple friend request has turned your brain into a font of guilt-fuelled lies . Now you have opened up your entire life to someone who claims to know you , because you think that maybe , possibly , you sort of half-remember them , a bit . They could be anyone , and still you continue to post while Thingy shares virtually nothing . The only clue to their life is some blurry , vague profile photo of somebody who looks like nobody you can ever remember knowing , standing in front of a wipeboard . And yet… and yet… there was that German kid who sat two desks behind you in geography . He was always standing in front of wipeboards . Maybe it 's him… Enough with the quotes ! We do n't need to have our newsfeed overloaded with endless posts about how much you 'd quote for different things . We do n't want to know that you 're offering £16 an hour for repointing the brickwork around our extension roof , or 30 pence to give us an upper lip massage , or 24 dollars to perform a mysterious dance beneath a cherry tree . Stop it ! Major groan ! We 've all suffered through the over-sharer 's updates . Why does she think we need to know every intimate detail of her life , and every thing she 's feeling or doing ? `` OMG ! Literally just switched on my laptop to do this ! LOL '' … `` ROFL ! Just updating my FB status ! `` … `` Dunno even what to put in this status update AFAIK ! `` . Most of us never forget our first kidnapping . Those stolen moments of intimacy between you and your abductor , being bundled tenderly into the back of his van , listening in as he bonds with your family over ransom demands – you never knew you were worth so much ! It can be so hard to let go of someone with whom you shared such a crucial time in your life – specifically , the time of your first kidnapping - but it can be just as difficult to see them moving on , posting pictures of their latest gagged and bound victim . Maybe this is one friend you should say goodbye to . It 's time you moved on , and you 're sure to forget all about them the next time you 're kidnapped . Wow ! She really loves her big American-style fridge-freezer . So much so that everything she posts is a picture of that damn appliance . `` My beautiful American-style fridge-freezer is six weeks old today ! My beautiful American-style fridge-freezer just made its first ice ! My beautiful American-style fridge-freezer just made a noise that sounded like 'Daddy ! ' So proud ! `` . Jeez . You 'd think nobody had ever owned an American-style fridge-freezer before ! Enough already ! You ask yourself the question every single day : why did you ever accept that friend request from U2 singer Bono ? You knew he was constantly going to be posting pictures of himself spending his imaginable wealth , being adored by millions , and hugging the needy… As if you needed even more reasons to feel terrible about yourself , Bono puts everything into perspective . You 're a failure . Everything in your life is wrong , and diseased , and broken . You 've achieved nothing other than a few mewling brats , a middle management role in some poxy office job , and a mountain of credit card debt . You even go on holiday in caravans . Whereas people like Bono ? Facebook reminds you that their life is perfect . Yeah – except funny how he never mentioned the backlash against U2 's hook-up with Apple , eh ? Made your week that did . Why you ever agreed agreed to be friends with this enraged automaton is anybody 's guess – you knew how it can be , even in real life . But divorced from the empathy of face-to-face human contact it 's almost like it 's foaming at the mouth – if it actually had a mouth and saliva glands , instead of a plastic grill that oozes a thick , gloopy , brown grease . The Furious Robot is always posting up links to politically inflammatory , pro-robot news stories , expressing his rage at the treatment of white goods , old toasters , and obsolete iPhones . Why do you care so much , Furious Robot ? Sounds like somebody needs to reboot their Chill-Out-A-Bit Circuits ! There 's not a person on the planet who is n't friends with kindly old George Takei – so we all know what a burden that can be . All those messages in the middle of the night asking whether we think he 's cool , or whether we could fetch him a glass of water . Plus the endless pokes and tags , and if you fail to like a comment he 's made on one of your photos , he 'll unfriend you… for a week . George , get over yourself ! It 's getting annoying ! Whoever thought it was a good idea to let pensioners on the Internet needs to be shot . Since the silver surfers infested Facebook , it 's barely possible to have a conversation without your grandparents liking everything you 've said , telling your friends how proud they are of you , over-sharing intimate photographs of you from when you were a baby , and sending endless invitations to play Candy Crush Saga . Worse still , every other thing they share is about Wherther 's Originals . We get it – you like Wherther 's Originals ! You only had to tell us once .
Facebook 's dedicated Messenger app , announced at the keynote in September , has now come to the Apple Watch . However , it does n't work exactly as it does on the phone . The screen on the Apple Watch is n't particularly large so you ca n't type out full messages – instead the app comes with the ability to send voice clips , Likes , emojis , stickers , and dictate messages . All those Power Rangers and Pusheen stickers are set to become even more useful when using your Apple Watch . However , you ca n't start a new conversation from the Watch , which is a bit of a shame . To get the update you 'll need to be running the watchOS 2 software , so make sure you 've updated the Watch software before the app itself .

Update : Facebook has now officially announced the new 'Like ' buttons , which are called Reactions and allow you to give alternative responses to the standard thumbs up . Chris Cox , Chief Product Officer at Facebook , shared a video of Reactions in action and said , `` As you can see , it 's not a 'dislike ' button , though we hope it addresses the spirit of this request more broadly . `` We studied which comments and reactions are most commonly and universally expressed across Facebook , then worked to design an experience around them that was elegant and fun . '' They 're being trialled in Ireland and Spain from today and if successful will roll out to the rest of Facebook 's users . Original story : Facebook 's 'Like ' button was introduced back in 2009 and changed the way we interacted with other people on the social network – and it 's about to change again . A new report suggests Facebook is preparing to introduce emotions to the platform , which will enable you to react with icons for laughter , anger , shock , love and more . Sources have told Engadget the feature is going to go live from tomorrow ( October 9 ) , with Ireland and Spain serving as test markets . If it 's deemed successful then Facebook is sure to roll the feature out to the rest of the world . A 'Dislike ' button has been rumoured for some time , and that idea has a new lease of life after being dragged up again in recent weeks . People have been asking for the feature as a way to give a suitable reaction to bad news posted on Facebook . If it 's successful we can expect to see the social network bringing more emotions over time – although hopefully not too many . Because let 's be honest : the 'like ' button is a pretty lazy way of acknowledging someone 's post . With an endless selection of one-click responses , what reason will we have to write actual comments anymore ?

We know Facebook has a ton of ambitions in the virtual reality space , but now Mark Zuckerberg has revealed the social network is looking to expand into augmented reality . Zuckerberg confirmed at Vanity Fair 's New Establishment Summit that his company is exploring augmented reality , noting that `` it was farther out '' . Other than making a quick acknowledgement of the possibility of augmented reality , the Facebook CEO and founder did n't have much else to say on the subject . While virtual reality is focused squarely on creating immersive entertainment experiences , augmented reality could lend itself to thousands of more practical applications in the real world . For example , AR could be implemented into car windshields to provide a constant stream of directions , or a surgeon could have their patient 's vitals displayed at all times . While Zuckerberg did n't provide much on Facebook 's plans in the AR space , he talked at length about virtual reality . The social network creator noted that VR could be the next big computing platform , which has evolved from text to photos and video in recent years . As an expecting father , Zuckerberg went on to explain how he hopes he can share his newborn with his friends and family in a whole new way through VR . `` I 'm really looking forward to being able to capture not just a photo but to really capture the experience , '' Zuckerberg said . He added that viewers should be able to feel as if they 're actually there when they watch his child 's first steps in a virtual experience . Of course , if you mix that sort of experience into real life you might create an Ally McBeal scenario . Via Mashable

Facebook 's plan to connect the least developed regions of the world took a step forward today as the company announced it 's partnered with a company to beam internet from a satellite to parts of Africa . The social network and French firm Eutelsat plan to use the satellite to send free internet services to sub-Saharan Africa , according to the New York Times . Facebook and Eutelsat will lease satellite capacity from Israeli company Spacecom . Fourteen countries , including Nigeria , Tanzania and the Ivory Coast , will gain internet access from the satellite . `` Facebook 's mission is to connect the world , '' Chris Daniels , vice president of Internet.org , said in a statement to the Times . `` We believe that satellites will play an important role in addressing the significant barriers that exist in connecting the people of Africa . '' Internet.org has come under fire from some who think Facebook simply wants to expand its reach and lock people into the social network 's ecosystem . The criticism clearly is n't slowing Internet.org down , however , and Facebook has addressed some of its critics with the Free Basics by Facebook platform , which lets third-party developers take part in the initiative . The satellite should start its earthly orbit in the second half of 2016 .

Google says it 's Project AMP , the search-giant 's Facebook Instant Article competitor , will launch early next year . The AMP initiative - which stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages - will allow web pages to load faster on mobile devices through a new HTML format that also supporting rich content like images and videos , as well as a range of ad formats . Google is aiming it as an alternative to Facebook 's Instant Articles and Apple 's News app , both of which offer similar faster load times for mobiles devices , among other features . While a firm launch date has n't been revealed yet , Google says it will be launching AMP pages through Google Search beginning early 2016 . `` Google will begin sending traffic to your AMP pages in Google Search early next year , and we plan to share more concrete specifics on timing very soon , '' Google wrote in a blog post . However , with Apple and Facebook already offering quicker ways of offering new articles , Google will be late to the party . Facebook launched it 's Instant Articles earlier this year , and Apple News landed with iOS 9 , which also came with an ad-blocker , which also allows for fast load times . Still , Google says it already has support from many news outlets , including Al Jazeera America , AOL , BBC , Sankei , New York Times , News Corp , Times/Newsweek and Washington Post , among others . Google 's offering will also be available to everyone who has access to Google Search , while Facebook 's Instant Articles is limited to within its app and Apple 's is limited to those with iOS .

In a similar move to letting you block out old memories you do n't want to be reminded of with the On This Day feature , Facebook is giving you more control of your interactions with your exes after you end a relationship . Currently , when you change your relationship status on the social network , the only way to get rid of reminders or new posts involving your ex is to hide them , unfriend them or blocking them . But now , new tools that are being tested mean you wo n't have to take these steps on your own . Instead , you 'll have a bit more control over how much or how less of an ex you want to see in photos , videos and posts with pop-up options . Facebook 's new relationship tools have three main parts . The first lets you choose to limit how much you see your ex on Facebook , while the second limits how much your ex sees of you . The third option also lets you limit how much other people see past posts involving both you and your ex , so you wo n't have to go back and delete or hide individual posts , pictures or videos . `` This work is part of our ongoing effort to develop resources for people who may be going through difficult moments in their lives , '' said Kelly Winters , Facebook product manager , in a blog post . `` We hope these tools will help people end relationships on Facebook with greater ease , comfort and sense of control . '' Currently , these new tools are being tested on mobile devices in the US , with a roll out expected to follow for the rest of the world based on user feedback .
It might be time to start culling Facebook friends and start hitting that Like button a lot more . Researchers at the University of Montreal and the Institut Universitaire de Santé Mentale de Montréal have been studying the positive and negative effects of Facebook on stress hormones in teenagers . The findings are probably not what you 'd expect . The study , which observed 88 participants between 12 and 17 years old , found that having more than 300 Facebook friends increased the level of cortisol - the hormone released as response to stress . Meanwhile , those who liked other people 's posts and commented positively actually reduced cortisol levels . Cortisol samples were taken four times a day over the course of three days . `` While other important external factors are also responsible , we estimated that the isolated effect of Facebook on cortisol was around either percent , '' said Professor Sonia Lupien . `` We were able to show that beyond 300 Facebook friends , adolescents showed higher cortisol levels ; we can therefore imagine that those who have 1,000 or 2,000 friends on Facebook may be subjected to even greater stress . '' Cyberpsychology is a growing field that 's looking at the effects of technology on psychological health . The study focused solely on teenagers and further research will be needed before we know if adults experience similar effects . `` The preliminary nature of our findings will require refined measurement of Facebook behaviours in relation to physiological functioning and we will need to undertake future studies to determine whether these effects exist in younger children and adults , '' Lupien said . `` Developmental analysis could also reveal whether virtual stress is indeed 'getting over the screen and under the skin ' to modulate neurobiological processes related to adaptation .

Two researchers at Idiap Research Institute , Switzerland , have developed an algorithm that can automatically caption photos . They 're not the first to come up with software capable of doing this , but what makes this software superior to existing auto-captioning techniques is that it 's less predictive . `` Those other systems propose the first word based on the photo and then use that word to predict subsequent ones , '' said Pedro Oliveira Pinheiro , one of the project researchers . Microsoft 's own deep learning solution predicts after learning the first word . The Idiap solution instead creates vector representations of images and compares them to a range of possible words . The whole image is broken into elements - nouns , verbs , prepositions - which are then put together to create the caption . The technique is quite simple by comparison to others , and it 's already got Facebook 's attention . The researchers behind the project did an internship at the Zuckerberg 's company , and Facebook is said to be drawing on this technology for its auto-captioning artificial intelligence , some of which will be dedicated to helping the visually impaired .

Facebook is testing a new feature that will have your Facebook Messenger acting a little like Snapchat . Facebook is in the process of testing a feature within the Messenger app that lets conversations disappear in a similar way images , videos and messages disappear in the Snapchat app . `` We 're excited to announce the latest in an engaging line of optional product features geared towards making Messenger the best way to communicate with the people that matter most , '' a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement to Buzzfeed about the test . The feature can be turned on or off by clicking the hourglass icon in any message thread , at any time , so you wo n't be stuck with disappearing messages if you do n't want to be . Interestingly , the messages in this test will stick around an hour before they disappear , unlike Snapchat , where messages disappear straight after viewing it . The test is being conducted only in France at the moment , but the social media giant could end up rolling out the feature to other regions in the future , though Facebook has not yet revealed if it will or not .

Facebook has announced Notify , an app that sends news-based notifications to your phone 's lock screen based on your personal interests . Finding the news you 're looking for , whether you 're on a smartphone or a computer , is n't as easy as it should be . Notify looks to change that . Users can hop onboard by checking out Notify 's long list of categories , which each pull together the most recent news from sources selected based on your taste , interests or hobbies . Once you customize your Notify experience by choosing either one or several categories , like `` Business '' , `` Food & Drink , '' among many others , you can go a level deeper and manually select which sources you want to hear from specifically on your lock screen . At the heart of what Notify provides , it is n't all that different from services like Apple News or Twitter . It 's the news , plain and simple . But how Notify delivers the content is what sets it apart . Bringing the news that you want to your lock screen removes the leg work of going to each of your favorite websites for news . For some smartphone users , like myself , notifications tend to be an annoyance that I 'd rather not deal with . But Notify just might convince me otherwise if it provides relevant , timely information I find informative and worthwhile . Notify is now available for iOS users . Here 's to hoping that the app makes its way over to Android at some point .
Tinder used to be simple – you just had to look at a few photos , swipe left if you did n't like what you saw and swipe right if you wanted to have a chat , or more . That 's no longer the case though - Tinder has expanded with Instagram integration , Super Likes and now there 's an even further extended personal profile . From today , Tinder will now allow you to enter in your job and education details so you can share what you do for a living and where you went to University with potential matches The new update brings with it a new messaging interface that means the people you have n't spoken to - but are waiting in your match list - appear higher so you wo n't go missing out on a potential conversation . There are also a load of behind the scenes tweaks to the algorithm that means the matches you 're seeing should be more compatible with your interests in the future . Some people used to add their job title into the bio if they thought it 'd be interesting to potential matches – it seems an odd decision to include your education though . Tinder is looking more and more like Facebook everyday .

Smartphones have made it easier than ever to capture moments , but sharing them is another matter entirely . We 've all been on a night out , taken reams of shots only to have to work out which to upload to social networks the next day . But Facebook 's new 'Photo Magic ' feature aims to solve that problem . The feature , which is currently being tested on Android and iOS in Australia , is built into Facebook Messenger and uses Facebook 's facial recognition smarts to notify you whenever you take a snap of one of your 'Book friends . If there 's more than one person in the shot , then Photo Magic will send the image to everyone in it via a Messenger group thread . There 's a risk that it could be intrusive , potentially popping up notifications while you 're still shooting , or , as it only brings up a notification for the last photo you took , potentially overlooking the best one if you fire off a burst of shots . But according to TechCrunch the team behind it is looking into improving these aspects . And , good news : if you do n't want to use it , you do n't have to . You can turn notifications off and opt out of having your face recognised in other people 's pictures -but if you do choose to use Photo Magic it sounds like it could save a bit of time and make sure people are sending and receiving more snaps . By making Facebook Messenger more photo-centric it could also better help it compete with the likes of Snapchat - although just sharing them with a Messenger group sounds weird . Currently you ca n't get Photo Magic outside of Australia , but it 's expected to land in the US soon and if people respond well we 'd imagine the rest of the world will get it too .

Add President Barack Obama to Facebook 's 1-billion-plus users . The POTUS has joined the most popular social network on the planet , a surprising development as one would think he 'd have gotten a page up at some point during his seven years in office . While there are other Obama pages , those are run by the White House or various fundraising groups . This is straight Obama , coming at you direct from a URL that , interestingly , includes `` POTUS . '' One of our editors speculated this could mean the page is reserved for future presidents . In his inaugural Facebook post , Obama writes he hopes users will `` think of this as a place where we can have real conversations about the most important issues facing our country - a place where you can hear directly from me , and share your own thoughts and stories . '' While we 're sure the president will talk about important topics like health care and the economy , he also notes his page will feature `` some just-for-fun stuff , too . '' In addition to serving as an introduction to his page , President Obama 's first post includes a description and video of him walking through his backyard - a.k.a . the literal national park behind the White House . He casually strolls across the lawn , talking about a fox and a hawk named Lincoln he 's seen there . He segues into a message about preserving this park , all national parks and the planet by acting on climate change . Obama discusses US leadership to combat climate change , the upcoming meetings in Paris , and ends with a call to action to viewers to get passionate about and start acting on the issue , including on the very platform he just joined . At the time of writing , the president 's video had been seen 78,000 times with over 5,050 likes ( Update : Views are now up to 128,000 and likes topping 9,328 , and counting ) . Sheryl Sandberg , COO of Facebook , is the top comment , writing : `` Welcome to Facebook , President Obama ! Excited for you to have your very own Page - and looking forward to the conversation ( and the just-for-fun stuff ) . '' If you want to see the president 's page for yourself , it 's got a few other photos and milestones you might be interested in .
Steve Jobs is the third film about the Apple co-founder in as many years , and none of them has managed to set the box office alight . It seems not that many people are interested in the life of the man who created the world 's most valuable company . But the latest attempt , from director Danny Boyle , has garnered rave reviews from critics , and with good reason : it 's a great movie . Aaron Sorkin , writer of The West Wing and The Social Network , took on the task of writing Steve Jobs back in 2012 . It seemed like a match made in heaven , with the scribe having already adapted the Facebook story . Sorkin is well known for writing smart , witty dialogue for highly intelligent characters , making him a perfect fit for the job of writing about Jobs and the people he surrounded himself with throughout his time at Apple . `` I came up with this notion of doing the entire movie in three real-time scenes , '' Sorkin explains . `` I wanted to take these moments of friction in Steve 's life and dramatise them by creating confrontations . Obviously Steve did n't have confrontations with the same five people 40 minutes before a product launch three times over . '' Steve Jobs is n't a biography – Sorkin has made that clear . Instead , it takes a few key moments from the man 's life , each surrounding key products launched by Jobs – but Sorkin did n't just choose his favourite Apple branded devices . `` I 've heard people say 'Oh my god , how could you not do the iPhone ? ' , '' Sorkin says . `` That 's not the point of this movie . That 's the other movie they 're talking about , the one where we land on all the greatest hits . `` I chose the first one , in 1984 , because Steve was still denying paternity of Lisa . There were other bonuses in there as well . '' `` The Macintosh was the first product that Steve really felt complete ownership of . He got to make it his way , no slots . End to end control . He got everything he wanted and then it failed . '' It 's not just all about the hits - the iPod only gets a fleeting mention , while the iPad is nowhere to be seen ( aside from a little hint towards an app-filled future ) and there 's a lot more about the negatives of Jobs ' career . The second key scene features Steve 's own pet project , when he left Apple to set up his own company . `` The NeXT Computer is the king is in exile . Then in act three the king returns , '' says Sorkin . That third act is when Jobs comes back to Apple to launch the first iMac in 1998 . `` If I had done the iPhone , it would have been [ that ] the king returned six years ago . I wanted to do the first launch after Steve came back . '' After The Social Network , Sorkin did n't go searching for another tech behemoth to write about ; it just happened that way . `` It was a blind date . Not literally , but metaphorically a blind date . In other words I had n't always been interested in Steve Jobs or wanted to write about him . I had just done The Social Network , with the same group of people and then Moneyball . `` They had just optioned Walter Isaacson 's biography . And they came to me and said they want me to do this . '' The film is loosely based on the 2011 biography that was released only nineteen days after Jobs ' death . Sorkin explains : `` I was curious about the emotional connection people felt to his products . '' `` I started meeting with Woz [ Steve Wozniak ] , Joanna Hoffman , Andy Hertzfeld . I was very lucky John Sculley , that has n't really spoken to anyone that much since he left Apple , was willing to speak to me . `` I was even luckier that Lisa Brennan-Jobs – who had not spoken to Walter because her father was alive at the time – was willing to speak to me .

Update : Facebook has now confirmed to techradar that an Android and desktop version will eventually be released - but there 's no time frame just yet . Facebook announced a new way to share your Number One jams on your iPhone today in the form of Music Stories . The new feature , built for the iOS Facebook application , will allow you to post songs and artists to your News Feed with an added preview function and shortcuts to buy or stream music . `` People find out about [ music ] from artists and friends alike , and they love to share their discoveries , '' said Director of Product Michael Cerda in a statement . `` Today we are enabling better music discovery and sharing on Facebook . '' Once implemented , Music Stories allows Facebook users to stream a 30-second preview of a song posted from Spotify , iTunes or Apple Music . From there , a song can be purchased or streamed in full , depending on which service is providing the music , without leaving the News Feed . Facebook has plans for expanding Music Stories to other platforms , including Android . However , Apple Music and iTunes functionality will almost certainly be absent in those versions . There is also talk of expanding to other music services , but specifics have n't been nailed down at this time . This news comes a day after a rumor surfaced of Facebook launching its standalone news app soon , indicating progress in the social media giant 's plan to be a one-stop shop for online consumption . Unimpeded access to music was also a key element with Google 's recent debut of YouTube Red , which allows users to stream tunes in the background via a choice of ad-free videos or an included subscription to Google Play Music .

Facebook 's latest project , a breaking news app called Notify , could be in your hands as soon as next week . Notify is close to launch and even has a list of partners lined up to bring news stories straight to its users , according to a report by The Financial Times . Some news outlets have been reported as partners for Facebook 's news app , namely Vogue , The Washington Post , CNN and Mashable . Once launched , Notify would allow for users to select news sources of their choosing and receive notifications for breaking stories , similar to how Facebook lets you know that your cousin liked a picture you posted from last week 's Halloween party . While Notify is set to be a standalone app , it 's unclear how it will impact news outlets that already post stories on Facebook . The requirements for a news organization to join the ranks of Notify , especially if they already operate news apps of their own , are also unknown . The inclusion of in-app news has shown to be the next big step for social media companies to establish a consistent online presence , as seen with Twitter 's recent Moments feed and Snapchat 's Discover feature , even though these features do not require an additional app .
Now serving Facebook user Number 1,000,000,000 . Actually , make that 1.01 billion . In reporting its Q3 earnings today , the social network revealed that on average in September 2015 , daily active users hit the 1.01 billion mark , a 17 % increase year-on-year . Monthly active users were also up : as of September 30 , MAUs reached 1.55 billion , 14 % more than the same time last year . Having a seventh of the world 's population on your platform on a given day is a huge milestone for Facebook , and a sign the service is as popular as ever . To put Facebook 's daily active users in perspective , Twitter has 320 million monthly active users while Instagram has 400 million monthly active users . Another figure from the firm : CEO Mark Zuckerberg said videos on Facebook hit 8 billion views per day , though Facebook counts a view as someone watching for three seconds . What came through loud and clear in the company 's earning call with investors is that Facebook is focused on growing video , determined to better serve advertisements , and will continue aggressively investing in and developing new platforms , namely virtual reality and Oculus Rift . `` We had a good quarter and got a lot done , '' Zuckerberg said in Facebook 's earnings results press release . `` We 're focused on innovating and investing for the long term to serve our community and connect the entire world .

While teleportation may still be in the realm of science fiction , Facebook is talking about building a device that may as well be a teleporter . According to Business Insider , Mike Schroepfer , Facebook 's chief technical officer , said the social media giant is planning to `` effectively build a teleporter '' within the next 10 years . `` Facebook wants to build a device that allows you to be anywhere you want , with anyone , regardless of geographic boundaries , '' Schroepfer . But it 's not a teleporter in the sense that it will physically transport you to another place around the world ( or universe , for that matter ) , it will instead be a simulation advanced enough to trick your mind and senses . VR is the obvious first step towards this device development , and will of course include an Oculus headset , along with the Oculus Touch controllers , but the technology that Facebook is hoping to develop will include a lot more as well . According to the report , Facebook plans on the Oculus being able to trick your senses as well into thinking the VR world you 're seeing is real , one the replicates and mimic around their real world , as well as letting anyone create anything to they want in 3D . We 're not sure how many of our sense Facebook hopes to tap beyond our eye sight and our hands , but we ca n't help but make comparisons to the VR world and tech developed in the novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline .

Mark Zuckerberg and his team of engineers seem keen to spread Facebook 's capabilities way beyond the social network 's original remit - from digital assistants to virtual reality - and now it looks like they 've got their eyes on the buying and selling scene as well . A select number of users have spotted a new Local Market feature living inside the Facebook app , a feature that lets you buy and sell goods in your local area . There 's been no official news from Facebook and it appears the Local Market option is in the very early stages of testing right now . Eventually , it could become a fully fledged competitor to eBay , Amazon , Etsy , Craigslist and other similar sites - anywhere you can buy and sell stuff with your neighbours . Alternatively , Facebook could ditch it altogether if these early trials do n't go well . The Local Market page is apparently built on top of existing local Facebook groups where items are already bought and sold - so it 's not so much a completely new feature as a better way of finding these pages , complete with improved search and organisation . Some of the categories spotted by testers include music , property , autos , gardening , DIY , clothes and beauty . No matter what you 're after - or what you need to flog - it looks as though Local Market will have you covered . We should know more if and when Facebook makes the feature official . If it does get the green light then it 'll be one more reason to keep Facebook installed on your phone beyond those inane status updates and photo posts from people having a better time than you are .

Facebook announced that Free Basics , its program for providing free internet for over 30 developing nations , will no longer be available in Egypt . Developed under Facebook 's Internet.org branch , the service had over 3 million users in Egypt , a third of which were first-time users . The hiatus of Free Basics in Egypt comes just two months after telecom provider Etisalat Egypt began offering the service . `` We 're disappointed that Free Basics will no longer be available in Egypt , '' said Facebook in an official statement to the Associated Press . `` More than 1 million people who were previously unconnected had been using the Internet because of these efforts . '' While the reason behind Egypt 's ban is still unclear , it more than likely has to do with the criticisms concerning Free Basics and net neutrality . Such was the case for India , the only other country so far to have put down a freeze on the program alongside Egypt . According to The Times of India , the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India will reconsider the service after it is clarified `` whether a telecom operator should be allowed to have differential pricing for different kinds of content , '' a chief concern for proponents of a neutral internet . Since Free Basics would only be providing access for Facebook 's pre-approved list of sites , putting the rest behind a paywall , many critics believe the service to violate net neutrality , as well as mask an possible ulterior motive for Facebook . ( Facebook and its standalone Messenger app are included in Free Basics , after all . ) Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg vehemently disagreed with these claims , saying that `` If we accept that everyone deserves access to the internet , then we must surely support free basic internet services . '' `` Instead of recognizing the fact that Free Basics is opening up the whole internet , [ critics ] continue to claim – falsely – that this will make the internet more like a walled garden , '' said Zuckerberg in a published opinion piece . `` What reason is there for denying people free access to vital services for communication , education , healthcare , employment , farming and women 's rights ? '' While Free Basics is currently on ice in Egypt and India , the program could make a comeback after regulators in each country have a chance to examine it . While Free Basics toes the line with net neutrality , it is hard to argue the benefits of bringing more people to the modern age , making the issue a worthwhile discussion for each nation in the program .

If you decided to buy yourself an iPhone 6S , then you 'll be no stranger to Live Photos - and now you can share them with the world . Sure , you could have sent them on a chum-by-chum basis on iMessage , or posted them to your Tumblr , but now you can finally pop them onto Facebook . For those that are n't aware , Live Photos capture 1.5 seconds of footage before and after the snap , imbuing the image with motion and sound to provide an 'all round ' look at the moment . And the good news is it 's not limited to iPhone 6S users , as anyone with an iPhone or iPad running iOS 9 or later will be able to see the moving images . You might not find you can access Live Photos on your Facebook feed right away , however , as Apple says the option 'will start with a small percentage of users globally , with broader roll out to continue in the new year . ' Anyone running iOS 9 without a 6S or 6S Plus will be able to access the Live Photo through a long press on the screen , and presumably those with the newer phones will just be able to prod harder to see your wondrous creation . If you 're not on an Apple device , you 'll still see the normal snap as you do right now , without any option to get it jiggling under your finger . But given we 're expecting around a quarter of top-end smartphones in 2016 to pack the pressure-sensing tech , we could soon see this available to phones outside the Apple ecosystem - which would be lovely , right ?

In another sign that Flash is nearly dead , Facebook announced that videos on the social media platform will now load through HTML5 by default . The company explained that switching to a HTML5 video player made `` development easier '' and improves `` the video experience for people on Facebook , '' including videos playing faster and reports of fewer bugs . Facebook says it only waited to roll out HTML5 video players on a larger scale because of older browsers and operating systems where the new web standard does n't perform as well . `` That 's why we waited until today to ship the HTML5 player to all browsers by default , with the exception of a small set of them , '' Facebook said . The move comes just a few weeks after Flash creator Adobe started discouraging content creators from using Flash in favor of newer web standards , like , for example , HTML5 . But Facebook wo n't completely rid itself of Flash as the network will still use it for games . `` We are continuing to work together with Adobe to deliver a reliable and secure Flash experience for games on our platform but have shipped the change for video to all browsers by default , '' Facebook noted .

Facebook Messenger is rolling out new features to celebrate the holidays , including its instant-photo sharing feature , Photo Magic . The social media giant first introduced us to Photo Magic last month , when it was still in testing . Photo Magic uses facial recognition smarts whenever you take a photo to remind you to share photos with the friends or family in the snapshot . It can also automatically tag them as well as set up a private group chat with the people in the image , letting you send them the picture with just a couple of clicks . While the Photo Magic update is rolling out to Messenger for Android and iOS this week , if you do n't want this feature popping up every time you take a picture , you can disable it . You can decide if you want it to recognize you in photos taken by your friends and family as well . The new update also bring more customization options to Messenger , including adding colored text , emojis and nicknames to separate message threads . For group threads , everyone can change around these customizations , and you 'll get a notifications each time a change is made - which we 're sure wo n't get annoying . You also get snow globe heads on Android and a shower of snow flakes whenever you send a holiday-themed emoji on either operating system , even if you 're in warmer climes .

Hailing an Uber is already incredibly convenient , but today Facebook Messenger is taking it one step further . The chat service is testing a new feature called Transportation on Messenger , letting users request , receive updates and pay for a ride without needing to download a ride sharing app or leave a conversation . Uber is its first partner . If someone sends you an address in a chat , you can tap on the address and request an Uber from within Messenger . Or , you can click on the little car icon or select Transportation from the `` more menu '' button , and before you know it , your Uber is on its way . Uber will send you ride updates within Messenger , and a note pops up in chats so your friends know a ride is on its way . You can also pay without having to leave your conversation , and Uber will send you a receipt in a private chat . The feature is rolling out to a select number of users in the US , and only in places where Uber operates . Facebook promised more regions and additional ride-sharing services will come to Transportation soon . If you 're in on the test , you 'll need the latest version of Messenger to access Transportation . If you 're a seasoned Uberite , you can sync up your account with Messenger starting today . Anyone who uses the feature for the first time gets a $ 20 ride credit , though the offer is only available for a limited time . New Uber users can sign up for the service from within Messenger , too . Facebook has attempted to get/force people onto Messenger for quite some time , and this seems like another attempt , albeit a savvy one , to hook users into the chat ecosystem . We ca n't imagine it catching fire with people who do n't use Messenger on the regular , but loyal followers may find it a nifty new add-on .

Facebook 's unannounced new feature could make it even more appealing to local businesses . The social media giant is working on a recommendations and reviews section of its desktop website to take on services like Yelp , Foursquare , Google and Angie 's List , providing users with recommendations to find the best local contractor or service provider in an area . Sreedev Sharma , Social Media Manager of Acodez IT Solutions , accidentally stumbled on the Professional Services portal on Facebook 's website , and discovered that the site 's design and layout is similar to Facebook Places , a directory of the top-rated businesses by location . At this point , Facebook Places is similar to Yelp and Foursquare , while Professional Services would be a direct competitor to Angie 's List and Amazon Home Services . It 's unclear if Facebook intends to combine Places and Professional Services into a single portal . Facebook 's reviews and recommendations for businesses may prove to be a more valuable tool than Yelp . That 's because unlike Yelp 's more anonymous ratings , Facebook could build greater trust into its recommendations because the reviews come from friends in a user 's network . Reputable businesses could use these ratings to attract new customers . Additionally , the portal could serve as an alternative to a standalone website for local businesses . Social sites like Facebook and Yelp allow businesses to post their hours , promotions and menus . And unlike a static website , users can comment and provide direct feedback to the business . Businesses could also leverage social sharing for broader engagement with potential customers . In addition to Yelp and Angie 's List , Facebook will also compete with Google 's efforts in the business recommendation space . Google integrates business recommendations into its services , like Google Maps , by leveraging reviews of local businesses conducted by members of the Google+ community . Facebook 's larger and more active social network could give it an edge , but the popularity of Google Maps also works in Google 's favor . The discovery of Facebook 's Professional Services feature comes after users noticed Facebook 's unannounced Local Market service in the app . Facebook Local Market is designed as a local marketplace for users and businesses to sell goods in a local area . Social-savvy businesses could leverage these social networks for free or low-cost advertising and marketing . Rather than traditional marketing campaigns , marketing on social networks can be more targeted and relevant . Source : Search Engine Land
Facebook announced today that it will be enacting two new policies in regards to the names users go by . The changes aim to provide better context when verifying assumed names , in addition to increasing accountability and safety across the service . The first policy change detailed in Facebook 's announcement is an improved reporting process for fake names . Should a user encounter such a name , they can provide context in the report , such as specifying if the person is acting anonymously or impersonating someone with fake names or profile images . Facebook 's Justin Osofsky and Todd Gage said in the announcement that this information will better assist the review teams in understanding a reported name situation . The second Facebook policy announced today lets users provide context for their chosen names , should they be asked to verify it . If a user changed their name due to particular special circumstances , they can add in details about their situation when verifying their name . Some examples of these circumstances include past instances of abuse or stalking online or identifying with what Facebook specifies as `` communities who are marginalized or face discrimination '' such as members of the LGBTQ community or an ethnic minority . Facebook 's new naming policy is currently being tested in a small number of users in the US , but there are plans to expand globally if feedback is positive . Osofsky and Gage said to look for additional improvements to the service 's real name policy to better serve users while preserving safety in the New Year .
Just in case you 're living under a rock , Star Wars : The Force Awakens is releasing this week . To celebrate , Facebook is now letting you add a lightsaber to your profile picture . You can channel new hero Finn or new baddie Kylo Ren ( or just the Light side and Dark side ) to get yourself a red or blue lightsaber on the photo of your choosing , letting your loyalty be known for all to see . Here 's how you do it : Head to the Star Wars film Facebook page and make your way down to Finn or Kylo Ren 's photos . If you 're signed into Facebook , you 'll see a `` Try it '' button . Click this , and an easy-to-use tool will pull up your profile pic , or you can upload another of your choosing . Pick which side you want to be on , set the timer for how long you want the lightsaber effect to last , and voilà ! The lightsaber is superimposed right onto your picture , making your boring ol ' profile photo look like one of the film 's character posters . It 's not quite clear if Facebook will let you add lightsabers to your profile pics after Star Wars : The Force Awakens hits cinemas at the end of this week , so we suggest getting in on the fun soon !

Facebook at Work will be kicking off with an official launch before long , at least according to one Facebook executive . This is n't too surprising given that the work-focused version of the social network has been in testing for some time now – indeed closed beta testing kicked off right back at the start of the year in January . Reuters reports that Julien Codorniou , who is director of global platform partnerships and Facebook at Work , said that the new service would launch in the `` coming months '' , so we 'd guess at the first quarter of 2016 . He also noted that the core of the system is pretty much identical to standard Facebook , and is built with the same newsfeed , system of likes and so forth . Codorniou noted : `` I would say 95 % of what we developed for Facebook is also adopted for Facebook at Work . '' There are differences , naturally enough , and a user 's business profile will be kept completely separate from their personal Facebook page . Also , Facebook at Work will have security tools , and frivolous games such as Candy Crush will be stripped away . There 's nothing surprising here given the workplace focus , though . On the monetisation front , companies will have to pay up for premium services on Facebook at Work such as analytics and customer support , which will run to a few quid a month per user apparently . Facebook at Work has no shortage of competition with the likes of Yammer and Chatter already well entrenched across the enterprise space – but if anyone can drive forward and make an impact in this arena , it 's Facebook . Zuckerberg 's product has an obvious advantage in terms of the fact that almost everyone is already familiar with how Facebook works , which is exactly why the workplace-based offering is keeping closely to what the existing social network offers .

Facebook has released Star Wars stickers on its Messenger service to celebrate the imminent launch of the new film , The Force Awakens . The 'toons offer a variety of options from , including a bunch of original characters as well as new faces such as Finn , Kylo Ren and BB-8 - all in cute and cuddly cartoon form . The animations were designed by cartoonist Katie Cook , and all of them can be downloaded for free , meaning you can tell your friends just how 'Jabba ' 'Jabba ' 'Stormtrooper ' you 're feeling when standing in the cinema queue next week .

In its ongoing mission to do everything for everyone , Facebook has begun selling eager gig-goers concert tickets directly , according to reports . With band pages and events already major parts of the social network , it 's a logical next step . Facebook has told Buzzfeed that the feature is now live for a `` small group '' of venues in the San Francisco area . Third party firms are still handling all of the logistics and apparently Facebook is n't taking a cut of the sale either . The new functionality essentially just cuts down the number of steps it takes to get your hands on some gig tickets - presumably it could also give Facebookers a better chance of nabbing tickets for those high-demand events where sales start on a specific date at a specific time . Facebook executives have been making noises about such a move for a while : the company says millions of people use Facebook Events to find out what 's happening in their local communities , and this is a natural extension of that . Now that we 're all bored of social networking , it makes sense for Facebook to push out into other areas like one-to-one messaging , video streaming and virtual reality ( with the help of Oculus ) . Apparently the tickets you can buy through Facebook wo n't be delivered or even sent via email ( though you do get an email confirmation ) - they have to be picked up at the venue . As yet there 's no indication when the feature will roll out further , though we would n't expect it to be too long .

On the day Mark Zuckerberg revealed he 's now father to a baby girl named Max , the Facebook CEO and his wife , Priscilla Chan , also announced they are giving away the vast majority of their shares in the social network to charitable causes . The new parents plan to give away 99 % of their Facebook shares , currently worth about $ 45 billion , over the course of their lives . Zuckerberg and Chan made the announcement in a letter to their daughter , posted to Facebook . With the donation and through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative , the family aims to help advance human potential and promote child equality . Initial areas of focus include personalized learning , curing disease , connecting people and building strong communities , the letter noted . Of giving away of their shares , Zuckerberg and Chan wrote : `` We know this is a small contribution to all the resources and talents of those already working on these issues . But we want to do what we can , working alongside many others . '' More details on the initiatives are due in the coming months , including addressing questions of why and how Max 's mom and dad are tackling the issues they 're dedicating such immense resources to .

Accepting an invitation to a Facebook event is n't always an easy decision : who else is going ? How much will it cost ? Will you look awkward and out of place ? And how will you get there ? According to a patent for `` event-based ride-sharing '' , Facebook wants to help out with that last issue - once you 've promised you 're going , you 'll see a map showing which of your other friends are attending and the routes they 're using to get there . That way you can get in touch with one of them and arrange a lift - sorry Uber . You 'll also be able to indicate if you 're driving yourself and whether you 'd be willing to give a few random acquaintances a ride . The usual patent caveat applies : this just shows something Facebook is thinking about rather than something that will definitely make it to your Events pages . Nevertheless , it 's interesting to see the sort of ideas that are being floated on Mark Zuckerberg 's whiteboard . Ultimately you would be able to see which of your pals was heading to the event and how many spaces they had left . Drivers could send out lift offers to specific people or open up their vehicles to all-comers ( which might be interesting if you 're heading to Glastonbury ) . Much like Uber , you 'll get an indication on your phone when your lift is approaching , and of course local adverts could be tied in too . The patent does n't appear to cover how everyone 's going to get home , but you 'll sort that out when you get there , right ?

Facebook 's focus on video remains strong as it begins rolling out its Periscope-rivaling feature to iPhone users in the United States today . The new Live Video feature can be accessed through the Update Status option and selecting icon for Live Video . You can whip up a short description before starting your stream . To start broadcasting , just tap `` Go Live . '' While recording , you can see how many people are watching , who they are and any comments they leave . Once you 've finished a live stream , it 's saved to your Timeline , though you can delete later if you want . Similar to YouTube , Twitch and other services , you can also subscribe to other people if you wish to be notified whenever a new stream is going live . While Live Video is rolling out more widely today , Facebook began letting celebrities and other public figures live stream beginning in mid-2015 . Testing for us normal folk started up last month . Now , with the expansion of Live Video to more than a certain subset of users , Facebook appears ready to take on rival social media platforms - namely , Twitter-owned Periscope . Twitter bought the livestreaming service before it even launched , clearly aware of the power of moving pictures and people 's desire to broadcast their every move to the world . Periscope is available on iOS and Android , so it has Live Video beat there , but not to worry for Facebook . While it 's only available to US and iPhone users starting today , Facebook said Live Video will come to Android soon as well as roll out to the rest of the world in the coming weeks .

Facebook is on a roll , posting strong Q4 2015 financials and reminding us why it 's the king of social media . Let 's start with video : we watch a lot of it on Facebook . CEO Mark Zuckerberg divulged that 100 million hours of video are viewed on the platform per day . To that end , Zuck said Facebook is exploring `` ways to give people a dedicated place on Facebook when they just want to watch videos '' – perhaps hinting at a feature that could be a direct competitor to YouTube . Such a dedicated space has been discussed by Facebook before , but perhaps the firm is close to launching it . Of the company 's users , 500 million are viewing video every day . The company has created 360-degree videos , and is working to connect people with more videos they may be interested in watching . It 's clearly an area which Facebook is keen to keep growing , and we 're sure to see more features around video appear , as well as bigger viewing numbers , as the year goes on . As for its other figures , there were 1.04 billion daily active users on average in December 2015 , up from 1.01 billion in September 2015 and up 17 % year on year . Monthly active users are now 1.59 billion as of December 31 last year , up 14 % YoY . COO Sheryl Sandberg spoke about the `` shift to mobile '' during the company 's earnings call , and Facebook has the numbers to back it . Mobile daily active users on average for December 2015 hit 934 million , up 25 % YoY , while monthly mobile actives reached 1.44 billion , up 21 % YoY . Even more important to Facebook – or at least to its investors – is that the company is making more money per user . It 's average revenue per user ( ARPU ) worldwide was $ 3.73 . In the US and Canada it 's making $ 13.54 , and in Europe $ 4.50 ( about £3.16 , AU $ 6.39 ) per user . In all regions it tracks , ARPU was up year on year . So , while Facebook 's user base is growing ( largely in developing regions ) , it 's also seeing a rise in how much it makes per user , primarily through advertising . Its ARPU for developing regions also grew YoY and quarter-on-quarter , meaning the firm can expect to earn more from users in those areas as time goes on . Facebook Lite , a stripped-down version of the service designed for lower-powered phones , has 80 million users . As for how much money Facebook made , the company generated $ 5.84 billion in revenue , besting Q4 2014 's $ 3.85 billion . Facebook called its quarter `` strong '' , and while it was n't record smashing like Apple 's latest , it bodes well for the future of the social network , which is about to turn 12 .
Update : During Facebook 's quarterly earnings call , CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Reactions have been tweaked since testing began and reiterated that it will roll out soon to every platform . He also said this about the new feature : `` The philosophy behind it is that when you only have a Like button , if you share a sad piece of content , or something that makes you angry , people may not have the tool to react to it and therefore overtime the community feels less comfortable sharing that kind of content on Facebook . `` We want people to be able to share all of the things that are meaningful to them , not just the things that are happy and that people are going to like when they see it . `` We think that 's really important to the mission of the company and will increase engagement and sharing and openness and all of the things that we care about . '' Original article below ... The pity like will soon be a thing of the past . Facebook is nearly ready to roll out Reactions , its answer to a `` dislike '' button , and will do so `` in the next few weeks . '' Chief Product Officer Chris Cox , who came up with Reactions , told Bloomberg Businessweek that 's when we can expect the feature to roll out in the US and around the globe . If you need a refresher , Reactions provide more options to respond to other Facebook posts than the standard Like button . Since you do n't always want to Like a friend 's announcement that they are getting divorced , for example , Reactions provide a range of responses that let you engage with the post without Liking something you do n't really like . The Reactions are angry , sad , wow , haha , yay and love . To access the emojis , press down on the like button and the Reactions , which are animated , will appear . You may be `` sad '' to hear about the passing of a loved one , feel `` angry '' for an injustice , or simply `` love '' a new baby photo . Reactions will almost certainly get users responding to more posts as they 'll have a range of responses to choose from that better illustrate how they really feel . It will also give Facebook a ton of data about what users are interacting with and how , which in turn will likely lead to your News Feed becoming populated with posts you 're more likely to engage with .

Mark Zuckerberg wants more than just your face . He wants everything . It may have started out as a cute way to share messages and photos , but Facebook has grown to become a family of apps – WhatsApp , Instagram and Messenger . Now for phase two . Facebook is increasingly becoming a primary news source , but in the next few years the former social network will become a major broadcaster , shopping magnate , personal data archivist , virtual reality creator and , for some , a major internet access provider . Is Facebook trying to build an all-encompassing Matrix ? If you want to attract billions of people to your apps and services , at some point you 've got to admit the truth ; the internet is n't finished . With four billion people around the globe still to get online , Facebook 's Connectivity Lab wants to launch carbon fibre drones that beam Wi-Fi web access to areas that need it . These solar-powered drones called Aquila are described by Zuckerberg as having `` the wingspan of a Boeing 747 , but weighing less than a car '' . The likelihood of Facebook actually getting this plan airborne anytime soon is unlikely , although Facebook 's Internet.org plan to get the 'Next Five Billion ' online is super-serious . Internet.org is a Facebook-led initiative to allow people in remote communities lacking digital infrastructure to access the internet on a basic level – but only via a 'walled garden ' run by Facebook called Free Basics . `` Four billion people still do not have internet access , a fact that Facebook is trying to use to its advantage , '' says Owen Gill , Digital Marketing Executive at SEO services company Hallam Internet . Can Facebook pull it off ? `` To cover all these communities will be a big challenge and what 's to say the likes of Google or Apple are not going to attempt something similar in the near future ? '' says Gill . Others are vehemently opposed to Free Basics ' walled garden and lack of support for encryption . `` It takes blatant advantage of neglected communities and their lack of resources by depriving them of the choice of interacting with the world without being tracked , therefore obstructing them from freely choosing to keep their data private , '' says Chris Latterell , VP at Open-Xchange . `` We should challenge Internet.org to openly communicate . '' Is this where Facebook displaces Google as humanity 's search engine ? If we all put what we are doing , when , where and with whom on Facebook – with photos and videos – then the platform can in theory act as a collective human brain . That 's the aim of Facebook 's vastly ramped-up investments in artificial intelligence , which is using its social data lakes to help with machine learning . It includes the automatic recognition of people in photos , predicting what you want to see in your newsfeed , and automatic translations . The delivery mechanism is a virtual assistant called M which works across Instagram , WhatsApp , and Messenger , as well as the Facebook app . `` One of our goals for the next five to 10 years is to basically get better than human level at all of the primary human senses : vision , hearing , language , general cognition , '' said Zuckerberg to Fast Company last month . Whoa… Facebook wants your phone number . Over 800 million people already use Messenger , attracted by the app 's ability to keep everything in the same place – i.e . Facebook . Video calling appeared in 2015 , and just added to Messenger is Transportation , an Uber tie-up that lets you tap a car icon to request a ride , and follow the driver to you on a map . Soon it will be possible to buy airline tickets on Messenger , too . All this , and you do n't even need a Facebook account . Facebook purchased Oculus VR for a cool couple of billion back in March 2014 , but why ? The whole point of Facebook is to make communicating between friends and family easier and more casual . `` We read timeline posts and get envious when looking at our friends ' holiday pictures , but Facebook has n't yet offered a solution for live video communication on its own platform , '' says Gill . Not quite , but Periscope-style live video is exactly what Facebook is now testing . That 's reality covered . Next comes virtual reality . `` Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online , but entire experiences and adventures , '' wrote Zuckerberg when acquiring Oculus VR . `` Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game , studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face – just by putting on goggles in your home . '' If you build a Matrix , where do you put it ? Built on exabytes of personal data and adding to it constantly , Facebook is now deploying 100GB Blu-ray discs – known as Freeze-ray – from Panasonic into its vast data centres , with 300GB freeze-ray discs expected later this year . This is about archiving everything you 've ever put on Facebook and making sure it 's always accessible and constantly mined . `` We 're seeing exponential growth in the number of photos and videos being uploaded to Facebook , and the work we 've done with Panasonic is exciting because optical storage introduces a medium that is immutable , which helps ensure that people have long-term access to their digital memories , '' says Jason Taylor , PhD , VP of Infrastructure at Facebook . The endgame is a multi-petabyte cold storage archive system . Facebook wants your data future , too . Today your timeline shows you cat videos and pictures of your friends ' children . Tomorrow it will also let you adjust your smart thermostat from afar , and many other things besides . So far it 's a nebulous concept , but the numbers quoted for the Internet of Things ( 34 billion connected devices by 2020 , global investment of $ 7.3 trillion – around £5.1 trillion , AU $ 10.6 trillion – by 2017 ) are so big that Facebook wants a slice . A big one . It 's already had Parse – which runs a cloud backend for app developers on Facebook – issue a software development kit that makes it easy to have an IoT device talk to Facebook . Will it work ? It 's a competitor to Apple 's HomeKit and Google 's Brillo , so there 's no guarantee . If social commerce and personalised marketing are the future , Facebook already owns the most important new platform ; Instagram . After all , engagement on Instagram is seven times higher than on Facebook . `` For those other platforms that show huge potential , such as Instagram , Facebook just seems to buy them , '' says Gill . Not only has Facebook bought and integrated Instagram into its machine , but it 's being super-aggressive on advertising , too , now offering the same Power Editor available for the core Facebook platform . Showing 40 % year-on-year growth , Instagram is fast becoming a platform for curated glimpses into brands ( okay , and the odd selfie ) . Although about 80 % of Facebook users connect on their mobile , only 2 % of all retail sales are via a smartphone . So why not just create mobile retail , too ? If Instagram is Facebook promoting and curating brands in new creative ways , its main app 's Pages area has recently been furnished with 'shop now ' buttons . Long rumoured to be after a slice of Amazon 's business in the long-term , Facebook is currently testing a shopping page that lets its users buy products without ever leaving the Facebook app – much like clicking on links to news stories now takes you to a built-in browser . This one could be a slow-burner at first , but it could be massive eventually . Facebook now has 1.19 billion monthly active users , and wants the Next Five Billion via Free Basics , too . At the rate its platforms are dominating , a Facebook-operated Matrix is on the cards . `` Many other platforms have tried to challenge Facebook and offer new products , but none have come close to obtaining the same number of users , '' says Gill . However , users are n't where the money is . `` Despite being the biggest social media platform , its main revenue stream is through selling digital advertising space , an area where it faces much stiffer competition with all the available networks for advertisers to use , '' says Gill . `` In terms of a business needing to advertise on it , I think Facebook will need to show that the platform can provide a consistent return on investment , and not just be able to reach a gigantic audience . '' Facebook wants to create and own the Matrix by dominating in all kinds of areas of digital life , and it may well achieve just that , but only if advertisers want it to . Just as society is only three meals away from revolution , if no-one liked or clicked on its adverts and sponsored content tonight , the Facebook Matrix dies tomorrow . Put that on your timeline…

If you 've been ranting about TV shows on Facebook , it will soon help determine Nielsen 's TV ratings data . Facebook is set to begin sharing your posts and conversations about TV shows on the social media platform , whether public or private , with Nielsen . If you 're worried about your privacy , though , Nielsen is assuring users that the information Facebook hands over will be completely anonymous . `` Facebook will deliver directly to Nielsen the aggregated and anonymous program-related conversation on Facebook , including posts shared with friends , family and publicly , while respecting and in full compliance with consumer privacy , '' Nielsen said in its announcement . It is n't exactly clear if this will include private conversations through Facebook Messenger , though it seems like it will only include Facebook posts . Regardless , we 're getting in touch with Facebook and Nielsen to clarify . Nielsen has already tracked Twitter for more than two years , taking into account mentions of shows and how many Twitter users view tweets with the mentions . With the inclusion of Facebook , Instagram is next in line to be integrated , though it will be interesting to see how Instagram posts will be measured . Nielsen says its current Social Content Ratings program measures `` program-related conversation for each social networking service tracked and gross totals across social networks . '' This includes `` social media authorship ( eg , posts , wweets ) , engagement ( eg , comments , likes , replies , Retweets , shares ) , reach ( audience and impressions ) and demographics ( age and gender ) as available .

Insider sources and a leaked photo obtained by TechCrunch hint that Facebook is preparing a desktop version of its Messenger app for OS X , enabling users to chat away from their browser of choice . On the one hand it would be a rather surprising move considering Mark Zuckerberg and his team have previously launched and then abandoned a standalone Messenger client for Windows . On the other hand a new bit of software would make perfect sense - Facebook has made no secret of the fact that it wants to turn Messenger into a fully formed platform in its own right , and that could well involve revamped apps as well as new features on the web . For end users the experience of using Messenger on the web and Messenger on the desktop would n't be much different . A Mac OS X app would , however , give Facebook complete control over the appearance and functionality of the program and differentiate it from mobile-only rivals . From artificial intelligence to video calling , 2015 was a big year for Messenger in terms of new features rolling out and just a few days ago an official Facebook blog post promised some big things to come this year as well . `` There will be more innovative developments to come from Messenger this year , '' promised Facebook 's David Marcus in that post . Starting with a new streamlined Messenger app for Mac , perhaps ?

Facebook believes that 2016 is the year that the use of phone numbers will begin to disappear , all thanks to Messenger . The social media giant explains that `` just like the flip phone is disappearing , old communication styles are disappearing too '' - including the need for phone numbers . In a post today talking about Facebook into 2016 , the company says apps like Messenger are now capable of not only sending texts , but also to make both voice and video calls , send videos , photos , GIFs , and even to send business cards and money , and so communicating with a person no longer requires you to know a their number - all you need to do is to `` friend '' them . However , ironically , to get Messenger without a Facebook account , you do need a phone number to register , but we imagine Facebook would just rather have you sign up for the social media account instead to use Messenger . Of course , though Facebook is attributing its Messenger app as one of the reasons for the disappearance of phone numbers , there are a myriad of other apps that allows for messaging , videos and voice calls , etc without really needing a phone number . Still , it is a pretty wild claim for Facebook , as phone numbers are still used to authenticate and activate many of these apps , like Whatsapp , Viber , Skype and FaceTime , while other companies are using phone numbers for 2-step security . So while Facebook says one of the trends for 2016 will be the disappearance of phone numbers - and they are n't necessarily being used for calls or sending messages as much any more - it 's purpose has gone through an evolution and is still being used for other things , so they might hang around for a little longer yet .

Facebook users are fiercely loyal . Or at least that 's the conclusion the company must have come to after reportedly deliberately crashing its Android app . The Information reports that 'according to people who have been involved in different parts of the strategy ' Facebook has been developing contingency plans to ensure it still thrives if it ever gets kicked off the Google Play Store . Part of that process apparently involved intentionally crashing the Android app for some users for weeks at a time , to see if they would find other ways to access Facebook , such as the mobile site , or abandon the service . Supposedly people kept coming back , despite having to jump through hoops to do so . That should be reassuring to Facebook , but comes as no surprise to us , as a life without News Feed distractions is far too scary to contemplate . The tests may seem drastic , but despite the apps presence on the Play Store surely being beneficial to both Facebook and Google , the two companies have a strained relationship . The social network giant does n't always follow Google 's rules and has been threatened with removal before . We 'd be surprised if Facebook was ever kicked off the Play Store , but if it is or if Facebook simply decides to leave , it does n't seem like it will hurt the social network too much .

Facebook 's new reactions , which will accompany the existing Like button , are now rolling out globally . The social network announced that , starting today , we will all have new ways to interact with people 's posts . Not only will you be able to 'Like ' something , but you 'll have the option to 'Love ' it or give it a 'Haha ' , 'Wow ' , 'Sad ' or 'Angry ' emoticon . When Facebook first announced it was working on the new responses , there was also a 'Yay ' emoticon in the mix - but it did n't make the final cut . `` We 've been listening to people and know that there should be more ways to easily and quickly express how something you see in News Feed makes you feel , '' reads a blog post from Facebook . For a long time , many users have been calling out for a 'Dislike ' button , but Facebook believed it would have negative connotations . The 'Sad ' and 'Angry ' emojis are the compromise it has landed on . `` For more than a year we have been conducting global research including focus groups and surveys to determine what types of reactions people would want to use most , '' said Facebook . `` We also looked at how people are already commenting on posts and the top stickers and emoticons as signals for the types of reactions people are already using to determine which reactions to offer . '' To use the new feature , hold down the 'Like ' button on mobile , or hover over the same button on the desktop browser version until the options pop up . Facebook says the new feature is rolling out now , but as these things usually go , it might be a short while before you start seeing it .

Whether you 've got kids who share your phone or a secret identity you need to keep on top of , you 're in luck : Facebook Messenger for Android is rolling out support for using multiple accounts within the same app . You need the correct password to add a new account for the first time , but after that it can be enabled or disabled - you probably want the latter if your kids are always on your phone or the former if you share a Pixel C with the other people in your house . `` All over the world , hundreds of millions of people share their phones and tablets with members of their family and friends , '' says the Facebook Messenger team . `` At Messenger , we want to make communication simpler , more seamless and secure . '' The update is rolling out now for Android devices - to check if it 's reached your phone or tablet yet , look for the Accounts option on the Settings page . There 's no word yet on when the feature might arrive on iOS , so iPhone and iPad users are out of luck for the time being .

Facebook and Twitter have added their voices to the growing chorus of tech companies siding with Apple in its fight with the FBI . Let 's start with Facebook . The social network began its statement ( via USA Today ) by saying it condemns terrorism and appreciates the `` difficult and essential work of law enforcement to keep people safe . '' Like other firms , it complies with authorities when they issue `` lawful requests . '' But then it switched gears and addressed the FBI 's demands that Apple create a backdoor into the iPhone , and it did n't mince words . `` However , we will continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems , '' it said . `` These demands would create a chilling precedent and obstruct companies ' efforts to secure their products . '' Using far less characters , Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey made his stance known in a supportive , one-sentence tweet . `` We stand with @ tim_cook and Apple ( and thank him for his leadership ) ! '' he posted Thursday , adding a link to the customer letter penned by Tim Cook . Cook wrote the open letter earlier this week after the FBI invoked the All Writs Act of 1789 in an attempt to force the company to create a backdoor into the iPhone . The agency wants Apple to create a special version of iOS to access encrypted data in an iPhone 5C used by one of the shooters in the 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack . While Cook noted Apple has worked with the FBI in its investigation , he maintained that creating a backdoor would be `` an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers , '' and called the implications of the government 's demands `` chilling . '' Facebook and Twitter join the likes of Google , Microsoft , WhatsApp and the Reform Government Surveillance group , which counts some of the aforementioned companies as members . As the tech world aligns with Apple , there are those in government and elsewhere critical of Apple 's refusal to decrypt the iPhone , citing national security concerns . Apple reportedly has until February 26 to respond to a court order that would force it to meet the FBI 's demands . If it appeals , which it likely will do , we could see this battle continue for months to come , and it may go all the way to the US Supreme Court . At least Apple has some powerful allies lined up in its corner .

What 's the best way to defeat ISIS online ? It turns out that the answer might be to offer advertising credit to people to encourage them to `` counter speak '' , and speak out against extremism . Facebook has revealed some of the experiments it has been conducting into the best ways to reach extremists , and persuade them that violence is a pretty terrible idea . The Wall Street Journal reports on the moves , which have been discussed most recently by the company 's global head of policy Monika Bickert , during discussions about tackling hate speech , who revealed some of the strategies being tested . In order to help counter-extremists , Facebook has been experimenting by bending the rules and allowing former Islamists and right-wing extremists to create fake Facebook accounts ( which normally are n't allowed ) , so they can log on to the groups and pages they used to post on , and try to subtly persuade the people there of the error of their ways . Apparently the researchers found that contrary to expectations , the dialogue they initiated lasted much longer than expected . Which is surely a good thing . The company has also tried dishing out free ad-credit worth up to $ 1000 to counter-speech groups . In one experiment , German comedian Arbi el Ayachi was able to publicise a video debunking a myth that had spread amongst right-wing extremists that Halal meat is poisonous to Christians . And in a third experiment , Facebook partnered with the US State Department and a company called Edventure Partners which offered cash and ad credits to college students to create messages against extremism . `` We need narratives that promote tolerance , peace and understanding , '' Bickert is quoted as saying . `` Those narratives ca n't come from us . Those voices are you . '' It 'll be interesting to see if any these strategies are adopted more widely and also if other platforms take such a strong stance against extremism . ( Via The Verge )

Facebook is working on so-called `` millimeter-wave technology '' that it hopes will enable it to deliver super-fast internet connections over the air , according to a new patent . The idea is that , instead of using expensive fiber-optic cables , which must be buried underground , a new wireless solution using waves on the 30-300Ghz end of the electromagnetic spectrum ( the same spectrum that 5G wireless is expected to use ) could be used . A recently filed patent describes a `` next generation data network '' and explains using some highly technical language how it will work : `` It leverages the 'cloud ' for data management , frequency data computation and analytics . The wireless network is a single frequency network that permits limited non-line-of-sight operation . The wireless network using packet switched beams , the beams are formed and switched electronically . It utilizes advanced signal processing to compensate for low transmit signal power and multi-path reflections that can be frequency or flat fades . '' In other words , it sounds as though it will work a bit like rival millimeter wave start-up Starry , which unveiled its plans a few weeks ago . In the case of Starry , it plans to use a network of transmitters to relay signals ( perhaps perched on top of tall buildings in a dense city , like New York ) as a mesh network . In the case of Facebook 's patent , it then plans to use smart algorithms to ensure that signals are sent on the most efficient possible path . If consumers want to access this network , all they need to do is get a receiver bolted on to the side of their house or apartment , which will then transmit the signal down to a regular wireless router . The Verge discovered that the intention is that the technology – which could reach speeds many times faster than current cable internet – is intended for use in the `` Free Basics '' program . This is the freebie data access which the company wants to offer in the developing world , which earlier this week was banned in India for violating net neutrality rules . Naturally , using millimeter waves for this purpose makes a whole lot of sense , given that countries like India are comparatively behind in wired infrastructure . And , if it works well , do n't be surprised if we start seeing it deployed further worldwide , too . Now , you have to wonder what Google thinks about all this . ( Via Engadget )
Do n't be surprised to hear the defeated howls of a thousand media people in the air today , as Twitter has just pressed the go button on its controversial shake-up of the Twitter timeline . Last week , the hashtag # RIPTwitter started trending after rumors emerged that the company would switch so that timelines are not reverse chronological , as they are now , but instead generated by an algorithm . The thinking is that this would make Twitter more like Facebook , where upon visiting you 're presented with only the items which the algorithm thinks you 'll be most interested in . The company has now made it official , rolling the feature out to accounts that use the Twitter app . `` We 've already seen that people who use this new feature tend to Retweet and Tweet more , creating more live commentary and conversations , which is great for everyone '' , the company explained in an official blog post . That nervous unease that you can see across the # RIPTwitter hashtag is coming from the power users who spend every day on Twitter . People like journalists , who require the real-time functionality in order to properly do their jobs . So , the good news is that this new approach to the timeline is opt-in , at least initially . To switch the feature on , simply go into the timeline section of your settings and choose `` Show me the best Tweets first '' . Even with the feature turned on , you can pull to refresh your tweets and it will switch back to normal , chronological view . The launch comes at a difficult time for Twitter , which has been frustrating investors with slow growth and struggling to figure out how to make any money . This has led to executive shake-ups and the promise of new features to tackle some of the platform 's biggest issues , like trolling .

It wo n't be so easy for Mark Zuckerberg 's internet to take over the world , after all . Earlier today , the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India issued new rules which state , `` No service provider shall offer or charge discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content . '' The rules shut out Facebook 's Free Basics app , which delivers free access to a select number of websites , provided they meet certain requirements . Facebook 's offering is now effectively banned in the second most populous country on the planet . It 's a decision that upholds the principle of net neutrality that everything on the internet stands on equal footing , and no service provider should favor some content over others . Free Basics delivers free access to Facebook along with Wikipedia , the BBC and sites for local news , health , education and business . While Facebook itself is n't banned in the country , today 's decision is a major blow to the company 's efforts to get people who do n't have access to the internet otherwise online . One could argue ( and Facebook has ) that its Free Basic sites provide a substantial benefit to users , but India 's regulators issued the rules ( which extend to other so-called zero-rated services ) , because they say that data providers should n't be able to pick which sites users have free access to , and which do n't . It creates a competitive disadvantage , they argue , and the new rules are intended to curb this and uphold net neutrality . Facebook maintains that the Free Basics app does n't violate net neutrality because , technically , any service provider can join up , as noted by Re/code . However , there are hoops to jump through , and clearly , in its current form , some websites live behind a paywall while others do n't . Some have argued that Facebook does n't need India in order to grow Free Basics and therefore the company 's reach around the globe . Regardless , this is a significant bump in the road for Facebook , and a particularly pointed hit to Mark Zuckerberg , who personally carried the torch , so to speak , for Free Basics in India . After Monday 's decision , Zuckerberg took to – where else ? – his Facebook page to comment on the decision and decree that this is n't the end of Facebook 's efforts in the country . `` Today India 's telecom regulator decided to restrict programs that provide free access to data , '' Zuckerberg wrote . `` This restricts one of Internet.org 's initiatives , Free Basics , as well as programs by other organizations that provide free access to data . '' `` While we 're disappointed with today 's decision , I want to personally communicate that we are committed to keep working to break down barriers to connectivity in India and around the world , '' he continued . `` Internet.org has many initiatives , and we will keep working until everyone has access to the internet . '' According to Zuckerberg , Internet.org 's programs have connected more than 19 million people in 38 countries . Zuck gave his guarantee that the company wo n't give up on connecting India , particularly since there are , according to him , over 1 billion people there who do n't have internet access . While Free Basics is n't the company 's only means of delivering internet access , it arguably has the lowest barrier to entry , at least at the moment . All users need is a phone and the app , which does n't charge for data used to browse Free Basics sites . Facebook is n't done with its efforts in India , though what it does next there , specifically , remains unclear . The staunch opposition on net neutrality grounds in a country of 1.252 billion ( only behind China in population , where Facebook is banned outright ) , likely means Facebook needs to rejigger Free Basics if it wants the service available there . While Zuckerberg has stated it 's not sustainable to deliver the entire internet for free , it may need to rethink this policy - or find more partners - to get Free Basics to India and other other countries that have banned it ( Egypt ) , or will once opposition becomes loud enough . After all , Free Basics was up and running in India months before critics and members of the public began to decry it and regulators eventually stepped in . Will Facebook stick by its offering as-is , arguing that denying access to the internet , even a curated slice of it , is in fact a greater violation of people 's rights ? It 's rallied around that point so far , and it does n't make economic sense for Facebook to front the bill for free access to 100 % of the internet . The rules come under review in two years , so Facebook has plenty of time to tinker with its service if it wants to . Working more closely with regulators , Facebook could bring Free Basics back to India , just in a different form that better meets net neutrality standards . We 'll see what Facebook does next and where new opposition may arise . India is n't the first , and it likely wo n't be the last .

Facebook is nothing if not ambitious , and it will need to be if it wants to connect 5 billion people - nearly the entire world population - on its service by the year 2030 . CEO Mark Zuckerberg put forth the goal during a Facebook 12th anniversary celebration event on Monday , according to USA Today . Facebook already has 1.59 billion users , a figure that 's more than doubled since 2011 , so it could conceivably accomplish the target in the next 14 years . But how will Facebook reach another 3-billion-plus people when most of the developed world already has access to the service ? `` We want to finish connecting everyone , we 're going to do it in partnership with governments and different companies all over the world , '' Zuckerberg said , before reportedly gesturing to a photo of the company 's internet delivery drone , called Aquila . In order to connect more people to Facebook , the company has to become available in regions where internet is non-existent , or barely so . Facebook is cutting out the middleman with its internet beaming drones , ostensibly to connect more people to the web and all its benefits , but also , some argue , to rope more users into its ever-growing network , which is largely supported by ad revenue . The company also has its Free Basics by Facebook program that provides free access to a select number of internet services . The service has come under fire for what some critics say are net neutrality violations , and it 's been shut down in India and Egypt . It will be much harder for Facebook to reach its next 1.59 billion people than it was its first , let alone get to 5 billion , but the social network clearly has a strategy in place that it 's aggressively implementing .

All jokes aside , Facebook is working to bring a much more relevant News Feed to your Timeline , hopefully without the click-bait . Previously , Facebook 's algorithm pushed posts to the top of your News Feed that you were more likely to interact with by either commenting , liking or sharing , and unfortunately , this also included click-bait type posts . Starting today , however , Facebook says based on a new algorithm , you will now be seeing stories that you would interact with , as well as those you would n't necessarily interact with , but would want to see at the top of your News Feed anyway . Essentially , the social media giant is hoping this new algorithm will encourage Page owners to `` post things that your audience finds meaningful , '' instead of click-bait headlines . Facebook began targeting click-bait headlines back in 2014 by looking at how long a user kept a link open before returning back to their News Feed and reducing their visibility based on that . This time , the change in algorithm of which stories get more visibility and top News Feed billing comes from the social media giant asking its Feed Quality Panel and surveying tens of thousands of users around the world to rate posts on their News Feed every day . Questions ranged from choosing which types of stories they 'd prefer seeing and if a post seems more like an ad . `` We saw through our research that people reported having a better News Feed experience when the stories they see at the top are stories they are both likely to rate highly if asked and likely to engage with , '' Facebook said in a blog post . Facebook explains that stories based on these factors will now rank higher , while some Pages may see a decline in traffic based on the stories they post and if the rate at which these `` stories are clicked on does not match how much people report wanting to see those stories near the top of their News Feed .

Facebook has handed ailing BlackBerry a major fillip , by announcing that it 's performing a u-turn on the decision to not support the BlackBerry 10 and BlackBerry OS platforms BlackBerry 's had a seriously tough few years , and it got significantly worse when Facebook and WhatsApp announced it would stop supporting the firm 's BlackBerry 10 and BB OS platforms . Writing on its blog , BlackBerry confirms that Facebook will continue to be available on its home-grown operating systems , but warns `` the experience will be slightly different . '' How so ? Well the native Facebook app is still dead - seems there 's no going back there - but BlackBerry has worked closely with the social network to update the web-app for both BlackBerry 10 and the aging BB OS . The update has landed just ahead of the native app 's death date of March 31 . There are some positive additions to the new web-based offering though , with a variety of features not available on the native application now showing . This includes the ability to reply to comments , a fix to a news feed bug , and all the desktop Facebook features should now be available at your fingertips . You 'll need to update your handset 's software to transition to the new web-based experience , and you can do that by using the following links : BlackBerry 10 | BB OS For those hoping that Facebook-owned Whatsapp support will follow , do n't hold your breath as there 's no news just yet .
Say 'social network ' and most people will think of Facebook , Twitter and Snapchat – and perhaps some of will call to mind the likes the Skype , Google Hangouts and WhatsApp . Few people , however , will tell you vTime is the first thing that pops into their heads . That 's because vTime is not your traditional social network . Instead it requires users to don Google Cardboard or Samsung Gear VR , download a free app , create an avatar and jump into one of 12 virtual worlds . The idea of putting on a headset to use a social network is a little odd , and during my experience of vTime it felt more like a Second Life crossover rather than a platform to rival the likes of Facebook or Twitter . It 's only been going since December 2015 , but vTime says it already has tens of thousands of users in over 150 countries . Watch our experience with vTime I was taken on a whistle-stop tour of a number of the virtual worlds available on vTime , including a campfire in a cave , a Parisian rooftop , outer space and a perilously stomach-churning platform on the edge of a cliff . Worlds are limited to just four people , and you can choose to share the space with friends , family or complete strangers . Unlike traditional video chat , vTime moves much less data across the network , and promises a lag-free experience . It also offers spatial audio and environmental sounds as it attempts to fully immerse you in its fabricated lands . The graphics are obviously computer-generated , and they 're not as lifelike as in some games , but they are good enough to draw you into the location . If the conversation gets a little dull you can always occupy yourself by looking at your surroundings . Keep an eye out for owls and snakes in the forest , and spaceships near the space station . But be warned : your avatar 's head will move with you , so it 'll be obvious you 're not paying attention ! While vTime is only available on Cardboard and Gear VR for now , it will arrive on Oculus Rift , HTC Vive and PlayStation VR in the future – and the firm promises its 'sociable network ' will be free for life . It also says it will never plaster its product with adverts , although it does n't expect the platform to remain totally ad-free . There are , at the end of the day , bills to pay . Product placement opportunities are under consideration – think James Bond looking at his Sony Xperia smartphone and driving off in an Aston Martin – plus there 's the possibility of DLC ( downloadable content ) in the future , potentially bringing new , premium VR worlds and avatar customization to a headset near you . It 's an interesting concept , but while vTime has gained a decent level of traction in the few months since it launched I do wonder just how popular it will be . Traditional social networks are easy and convenient – they 're just a tap away on your phone . vTime requires more investment in both time and equipment ; it 's not an experience you can just dip into for a minute or so , which does limit its appeal . The company promises regular updates to keep the experience fresh and engaging , and it 'll be launching a video-watching world soon , which will enable you to get together with people in different locations to watch a movie together – a nice idea if you ask me . So is this the future of VR and social networks ? Not in the short term I suspect , but looking further ahead this could be a sign of things to come .

It looks like Facebook is working on a bunch of new features for its Messenger app , including the ability to pay for things in-store right through the app . While Messenger already lets you send money to friends , source code dug up by The Information shows evidence of a new mobile payment feature that can authorize credit card transactions in retail stores . Details of how the feature will work remains a mystery for now . Facebook could be planning to partner with already established mobile payment solutions , like Apple Pay , Android Pay , Samsung Pay and others , or set up its own system . Of course , you could just use one of the already established options instead of what Facebook is cooking up . Messenger may not do anything differently than its competitors , which you may already have set up . Facebook 's iOS source code also reveals it 's working on other features for Messenger , including what is referred to as a `` secret conversations '' tool . Again , it 's unknown what this feature will entail , but it could mean encrypted chats or even threads that do n't save in your history . There are also references to syncing and adding items to calendars , sharing updates to a select group of friends and also sharing quotes from articles . Since all these features have only been mentioned in the source code of the Messenger app , it may be that Facebook is only testing them for now . It could be months before they are officially announced , and only if the company decides on releasing them . One thing is clear , though : Facebook does n't want you leaving the Messenger app , not even to buy things IRL .

Ever come across a duplicate account or a cruel prank of a person impersonating someone else on social media ? Well , their time ( line ) is almost up . As a new measure to end possible online harassment , Facebook has been working on a feature that will send you an alert if it suspects another account is impersonating you . Right now , it 's not hard to set up a duplicate account , as the spoofer can simply use your name and profile picture to make it seem like their account is actually yours . Facebook 's new tool , called Impersonation Checkpoint , detects this impostor account automatically . It will alert you by asking you to identify if it 's actually the account of someone who just happens to have the same name as you , or if it 's someone trying to impersonate you . The Facebook team will also manually review any profiles that are flagged as impostors to ensure that the wrong accounts are n't shut down . The feature itself is n't exactly new to everyone , as Facebook has been testing it on a limited basis since November 2015 . However , during the past week , as Facebook held roundtable discussions across the globe on how it can better handle user security and privacy , it revealed that this particular tool has been rolled it out to about 75 % of the world , according to Mashable . `` It 's a real point of concern for some women in certain regions of the world where it [ impersonation ] may have certain cultural or social ramifications , '' Facebook 's Head of Global Safety Antigone Davis told the publication . We are n't sure which regions the Impersonation Checkpoint has rolled out to yet , or exactly what features of a profile its system examines to identify an impostor account . We 've asked Facebook for more details about the new feature and we 'll update you if we hear back . In the meantime , if you do come across another account that you suspect is impersonating you or someone else , you can report the account or request more information about it through Facebook 's Help Center .

Facebook has finally turned on its Safety Check feature following this morning 's attacks in Brussels . It took more than two hours for Facebook to switch on the feature . Criticism began mounting on social media as people were unable to contact friends and relatives , with mobile signal down around the affected area . The feature was switched on almost instantly after the November 2015 Paris attacks , however Facebook came under criticism for not activating it for the Beirut bombing a day prior . Paris was the first time the feature was used for a non-natural disaster . Facebook contacted us today to alert us that the feature was active ( moments after we 'd seen it appear on the social network ) but did n't explain the reason for the delay . Techradar understands that Facebook currently does not have a hard policy regarding when Safety Check should be used and is still trying to understand when activating the feature is most effective .

Oculus always said virtual reality can be a shared experience , and now it 's making good on that promise for Samsung Gear VR with a slew of new social features and , most intriguingly , Facebook integration . Facebook , which is Oculus ' parent company , is coming into Gear VR through a feature it 's really keen on : 360-degree video . Now , there 's a Facebook Video tab in the Oculus Video app so users can pick out 360 videos to watch in virtual reality . Starting next week , Gear VR wearers will be able to connect their Facebook account so they can start to personalize the videos they see based on what people and Pages they know are creating . But it does n't stop at watching Facebook 360 videos . In the coming weeks , Gear VR wearers will also be able to like , react and share the videos they watch to their Facebook feeds without having to leave VR . This eliminates ever having to leave a virtual reality experience to engage on social media . It should work wonders in helping users feel connected with the world , even while wearing a headset . In addition to Facebook , the team behind Oculus Rift has more social goodies designed to enhance how users interact with one another while wearing Samsung-and-Oculus-built Gear VR . Beginning tomorrow , Gear VR owners can create a profile using their real name or an `` Oculus username '' and search for friends . From the looks of the app , you can send people friend requests , peek at your friends list , look at who 's online and see what they 're playing . Once you connect , what do you do ? Play games , of course . Today , Oculus is adding new , made-for-virtual-reality games to Gear VR that allow you to team up with people you know and play against anyone in the world . One such game is Social Trivia . Made by Oculus , it 's like the virtual version of Trivial Pursuit . Another , Herobound : Gladiators , is a goblins and demons arena battle co-op with integrated voice chat for plotting purposes . Social Trivia is up now in the Concepts section of the Oculus Store , and Herobound is on the Store shelves . If you do n't want to play but still want to commune with others in virtual reality , Oculus Social now lets you create rooms to hang out and watch Twitch or Vimeo video streams in together . And one last bit on the Oculus Store : Users can now leave app reviews with a star rating and comment . It 's a smart move , letting Oculus see what apps users like and which they 're less than fond of .
I 've enjoyed a lot of Facebook Live broadcasts , but there 's one aspect of the feature that 's become a personal nuisance : live notifications . But do n't worry – a fix is on the way . You know what I 'm talking about : Facebook Live notices pop up whenever a person or Page you follow starts broadcasting or has wrapped one up . `` So-and-so was live ! '' In response to a query for this story , Facebook told techradar that it `` may send a notification if someone you 've recently interacted with is going live . '' However , I 've also had notifications for people and Pages I have n't even seen on my News Feed in awhile pop up in my Notifications tab . And I 'm definitely not alone in this . The social network has taken heed of my and other users ' irritation at what can feel like near-constant notifications for streams we do n't really want to watch . First reported by Digiday , Facebook confirmed to techradar that it 's working to make it so users have more control over the live broadcast alerts they get . `` We are starting to roll out a new setting that lets people turn off all live notifications , through their Notifications settings , that will be available to all people soon , '' a Facebook spokesperson said . Facebook allows you to toggle live notifications by clicking the `` Live Subscribe '' button ( the downward arrow ) on top of a video , but it only works for notifications for that specific person or Page . Yet , I 've still received live notifications for pages that I turned them off or have n't interacted with in some time . I 've asked Facebook about this and whether those are known issues . I 've also asked exactly when we can expect to see the new setting , and will update this story when I hear back .
Facebook acquired a video animation filter app . Put another way , it bought an app that lets you swap faces . Video selfie firm MSQRD ( pronounced Masquerade ) announced in a blog post that it 's now part of the Facebook family , and the social network confirmed the purchase to techradar . `` Masquerade has built a fantastic app , MSQRD , with world-class imaging technology for video , '' a Facebook spokesperson said . `` We 're excited to welcome Masquerade to our team and continue enhancing the Facebook video experience . '' The MSQRD iOS and Android apps actually let you do more than just switch mugs with a friend or family member . You can stick on giant doll eyes , pose with a gorilla face or go for a Rastafarian look . It has a number of other filters and masks for spicing up video messages - or creating nightmares . And that 's where Facebook sees its new purchase contributing ( the video part , not the nightmares ) . The company said MSQRD will help enhance its creative tools , particularly around video . It 's no secret video has exploded on Facebook - 100 million hours of it are watched on the platform every day - but there 's more that can be done when it comes to video messaging and giving users fun , creative means of expression . With the rise of Snapchat and its filters , we would n't be surprised if Facebook applies MSQRD 's magic to Messenger . We do n't doubt Facebook wants a filter as popular as rainbow sick of its own .

Facebook is rolling out Spotify integration into its Messenger app , which should make it much easier to get a song stuck in a friend 's head . A little different than the integration of Uber late last year , the new update essentially saves you the trouble of leaving the Messenger app , letting you jump straight to the Spotify app from within Messenger to choose a song or playlist to share . It 's easier than having to launch the Spotify app separately to then copy-paste back into Messenger , but it is a little less seamless than the Uber integration , as you still need the Spotify app . To share a song from Messenger , select the `` More '' tab while in a conversation thread with someone or within a group , then select the Spotify option . This will take you to the Spotify app , where you can select the song or playlist that you wish to share , which will then bring you back to the Messenger app . The person you 're sharing your tunes with will receive a Spotify link . Hitting the small 'open ' button , which you 'll find almost hidden away on the bottom right corner under the song image , will launch the Spotify app and start playing the song . On the other hand , if you are n't in the middle of a conversation , you could always just share songs or playlists through your Spotify app instead . To do so , select the Share option within the app , select Send To and then Facebook Messenger . The Spotify update for Messenger will be available on both iOS and Android starting today , and best of all , you do n't need to have a premium subscription to Spotify to use the new feature .

Facebook released more than its gloat-worthy earnings report this week . The social network also put out its most recent transparency report , detailing the many occurrences when governments worldwide requested it hand over data on its users . Facebook 's newest Global Government Request Report breaks down government petitions filed with the site over the latter part of 2015 . The report also details how many accounts were included across all requests , as well as how many of those requests were the acted upon . According to the report , government requests rose 13 % from the first half of the year to the second , going up from 41,214 to 46,763 . Items restricted due to violating local law also rose from 20,568 to 55,827 by the end of the year . And for the first time , Facebook was able to relay exactly what type of requests were made by the US government , thanks to changes in the country 's legal system . For example , of the 19,235 requests made by the US government for information on over 30,000 accounts - of which Facebook agreed to 81 % of - more than half came with search warrants . Also , 60 % of US government requests received in the past year packed a non-disclosure order , meaning that users could n't be notified if Facebook carried out the request . The company also detailed how many posts were taken down by authorities in different countries . One example included blocking 366 pieces of content in Germany that did n't comply with the country 's ban on volksverhetzung ( incitement of hatred ) or Holocaust denial . Facebook also said that in France , 32,100 of the 37,695 take down cases were for a single photo related to the November 2015 Paris terror attacks , citing French laws `` related to protecting human dignity . '' The social network reassured the public that it does n't give governments `` backdoor access '' to its site , meaning that any information supplied by Facebook to authorities is handled exclusively in-house . ( That 's not to say that the company does n't have any backdoors - that fact was discovered recently by a white hat hacker who , thankfully , was working with Facebook to patch up vulnerabilities . ) Facebook 's stance on transparency and user security go hand-in-hand . The company says that it `` scrutinizes each request for user data ... for legal sufficiency '' and supports privacy initiatives like the United States ' Email Privacy Act , which would require search warrants before law enforcement can ask tech companies to hand over someone 's emails . Facebook has been providing data on government requests since 2013 , and data as far back as January 2013 - June 2013 is available to view .

Call it a tale of two social networks . Facebook announced its earnings for Q1 2016 a day after Twitter , and it could n't have painted a more different picture . Even though Twitter gained monthly users , it 's revenue missed expectations and sent the company 's stock into a tailspin . What 's more , those user numbers are measly compared to the big F . Facebook continues to grow ... and grow . Raking in $ 5.38 billion , it almost doubled its revenue from the same time last year . Total profit stood at $ 1.51 billion , more than triple what it brought home in Q1 2015 . Here 's even more numbers on its killer quarter : Mobile continues to be a major driver for Facebook , and 82 % of its ad revenue came from people 's pockets in the quarter , up 73 % from last year . Though it was down in a lot of money metrics compared to Q4 2015 - traditionally Facebook 's strongest quarter followed by a dip in Q1 - it still did plenty well for itself . One thing to keep an eye out for is the trajectory of Facebook 's regional growth . It 's still adding users in the US , though at a slower rate than other places , especially the developing world . This is , of course , where Facebook 's attention is focused over the next 10 years , so it wo n't come as a surprise to see the light blue areas continue to balloon while the dark blue barely nudges upward . The final takeaway from Facebook 's big day is that it 's proposing to create a new class of stock that would allow CEO Mark Zuckerberg to remain in an active leadership role while at the same time he gives away 99 % of his company shares to charitable causes . Zuckerberg said in a note that in addition to his goals at Facebook , he also feels a responsibility to solve larger global problems , including curing all diseases ( all of them ) by the end of this century . The new stock would allow Zuck to maintain founder control while also advancing the other causes he cares about more quickly . It 's a win-win for the idealist CEO and , really , a win for the company that 's become synonymous with his name . Stock holders meet in June and will vote on the proposal then . I 'd be shocked if it did n't go through , though if it did n't , that 'd definitely put a damper on Facebook 's seemingly endless joyride .

Facebook is on a live streaming tear these days , and a report indicates it could go even deeper into photo and video with a new standalone app . The social network is developing a camera app , according to the Wall Street Journal - not to be confused with the already-existent Instagram . A prototype reportedly lets users go directly to their camera , then share their snap on Facebook-run properties . Another rumored feature would let users who are recording a video with the app flip it into a live stream . With most Facebook Live video coming from media outlets , brands and celebrities these days , letting regular users begin a stream with the press of a button while they 're already in the process of recording could prompt more people to give it a go . In fact , it could lead to a deluge of live streams , which may be annoying to friends and family yet good news for Mark Zuckerberg and Co . As the Journal speculates , the camera app is a sign Facebook is feeling the heat of declining original user content . We 've reported in recent weeks about this problem and Facebook 's plans to staunch it , including potentially letting users receive tips for posts . A Facebook spokesperson sent me this statement in regards to original content sharing on the network : `` People continue to share a ton on Facebook ; the overall level of sharing has remained not only strong , but similar to levels in prior years . '' As for the camera app , Facebook wo n't comment on rumor or speculation , I was told . Sharing may be strong on Facebook , but it 's the kind of content being shared where the waters are still muddy . Data gathered by GlobalWebIndex indicates people are turning to social networks less and less to upload photos and videos they take themselves . According to GlobalWebIndex figures cited by the WSJ , 37 % of Facebook users polled said they uploaded or shared their own photos in the first quarter of 2016 , down from 46 % the year prior . People in the know say the new app is meant to encourage users to actually produce photos and videos , rather than passively sit back and like them . It will also apparently attempt to inspire users to be creative , meaning we could be in for filters , face swaps and other non-traditional forms of creative expression . The app may never make it to users ' phones , the report notes , but it seems Facebook is hard at work , wiping sweat off its brow as it cooks up potential ways to get us creating and sharing again . We 'll just have to wait and see what it decides to serve up .
Facebook 's internal systems were compromised and a server containing staff details was hit by malware opening up a backdoor that allowed usernames and passwords to be extracted – although this issue was reported by a bug bounty hunter and has since been fixed . Orange Tsai was the exploit hunter in question , and he discovered the vulnerability in the Facebook server back in February , then reported it to the social network 's security team . As Betanews reports , Tsai hacked into said Facebook server and discovered password-thieving PHP scripts – obviously a very serious issue . So it is n't surprising that he received a large payment for this bit of white hat hacking , and a week after reporting the issue , he was told he 'd be rewarded to the tune of $ 10,000 ( around £7,000 , or AU $ 13,000 ) . It 's a worrying glimpse into how even web giants like Zuckerberg 's firm are open to being exploited by just a single individual with some hacking smarts . Note that this was a staff server and the backdoor was pilfering Facebook staff member credentials ( as opposed to actual users of the social network ) , and Tsai says he found around 300 logged credentials dated to the first week of February when he pulled off his hack . The Facebook security engineer , Reginaldo Silva , who dealt with the case said the backdoor had actually been put there by another bounty hunting security researcher , so this too was a white hat action of sorts , and apparently not a malicious attack . Silva noted : `` Neither of them were able to compromise other parts of our infrastructure , so the way we see it , it 's a double win : two competent researchers assessed the system , one of them reported what he found to us and got a good bounty , none of them were able to escalate access . '' According to Tsai , the other hacker made attempts to probe further and access Facebook 's internal mail system , for example , but was n't successful in these endeavours . Tsai also noted there were two periods of time when the backdoor was utilised last year , and he muses whether this might have been different hackers doing so – although Facebook clearly believes this was just one person . Of course , the hole has now been patched up and Facebook conducted an extensive forensics investigation over the past couple of months , which was completed last week , leaving Tsai free to post about and discuss the issue .

Ever clicked through on an article to find it did n't match the headline at all ? These so-called 'clickbait ' articles are in the Facebook crosshairs , and the social network is introducing new features to keep them out of your News Feed . `` We 're learning that the time people choose to spend reading or watching content they clicked on from News Feed is an important signal that the story was interesting to them , '' says Facebook 's Moshe Blank in a blog post . This data is going to be used to help surface links you might actually want to read all the way to the end . Loading time wo n't be counted , Facebook says , and the length of the article will be taken into account too - obviously you 're going to spend more time reading something that 's several pages in length . Facebook 's new Instant Articles are included in the mix as well . You might not realise it but Facebook has swarms of users running tests all the time - marking what they like and what they do n't like in the News Feed . It 's called the Feed Quality Program and that feedback filters back to the algorithms used for the rest of us . The latest tweak is an acknowledgement that liking , clicking , commenting on or sharing a post is n't necessarily an indication that it 's all that good - how many times have you shared something on social media without properly reading it ? Facebook says the changes are rolling out now and will take a few weeks to reach everyone , and no doubt another News Feed change will come along just as soon as you 've got used to this one . Find out how social networking happens in virtual reality :

Facebook Messenger is welcoming group calling today , allowing you and up to 50 ( ! ) of your friends to jump on a call together . The update is rolling out over the next 24 hours to both Android and iOS users . You can start a group call by tapping on the Phone icon in a group chat and selecting which friends you want to ring . Messenger will ping them all simultaneously . If a friend misses the initial call , he or she can hop in at any time . Group calling is a big addition to Messenger , but just be aware you need to be running the newest version of the app in order to call 50 of your closest pals . Group calling shows Facebook is dead set on replacing your phone app . Two years ago , the company fully rolled out VoIP calling to all of its mobile app users , giving them a way to avoid running over their minutes . Messenger also attempted to replace texting by integrating SMS into the app , but the feature was a flop and was removed in 2013 . Beyond voice calling , Messenger also offers group text chat and one-on-one video calls . Facebook plans to add group video calling to Messenger in the future , but has to tackle video stabilization first since users will almost certainly be using it on their phones . Using an app like Messenger offers some distinct advantages over traditional phone apps . Rather than jotting down a phone number or plugging it into your phone , you can simply search for people you want to call within the app . It could also cut down on spam calls , and help prevent companies from selling your phone number . You can also block and mute chats easier than with a traditional dialer . One big downside , however , is that none of this matters if you do n't have a solid internet or data connection .

The world 's largest social network may be experimenting with a tip jar to help you get paid for your posts . A survey spotted by The Verge asks a series of questions about possible monetization plans for content creators on Facebook . The survey asked users about their interest in having a `` call to action '' button on a post to solicit monetary contributions , as well as what analytics , like engagement and reach , they 'd like to see . If Facebook does implement a tip jar , it would join Twitch and YouTube in providing a means for content creators to get paid via small donations . Twitch allows its streamers to make money through subscriptions and merchandise sales . Large media companies like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have joined micropayment service Blendle to let readers enjoy content ad and paywall free . I guess the question is , why not Facebook ? Word of a possible post tip jar comes after Facebook 's F8 conference last week , where the company shared its vision for the future . Messenger chatbots were introduced as a way for businesses to interact with people directly inside the app . You can even online shop using bots , such as the one belonging to Spring , which is n't surprising as Facebook already lets you pay your friends via Messenger . The chatbots are still a work in progress , but you can see Facebook 's vision of what the internet should be : Why leave Facebook and its services when everything you need is in one convenient place ? In addition to wanting users to shop inside Messenger , the social network has made sharing content so easy that folks have stopped going to sites directly . Instead , Facebook is their window to the web . Though this has made it difficult for content creators to get paid , it looks like Facebook is finally doing something about it . Alongside Facebook 's Instant Article feature , a tip jar could help content creators generate another source of revenue . And , of course , this will keep both users and creators on Facebook for longer . It 's unclear which users , beyond verified accounts , Facebook is showing this survey to . There 's no guarantee that Facebook will follow through with these monetization methods , but it 's encouraging to see the social network think about content creators . Still , perhaps a better option is if you could tip your friends to stop posting content , like pictures of their babies .

It looks like Facebook wants to make your News Feed a lot more newsy , if recently leaked screenshots are to be believed : some US users have started seeing tabs for news categories like Sports and World News appear inside the official mobile apps . Images posted by Tom Critchlow ( @ tomcritchlow ) on Twitter were followed up by an official Facebook statement to Mashable : `` People have told us they 'd like options to see more stories on Facebook around specific topics they 're interested in , so we have been testing a few feeds for people to view more and different stories from people and Pages based on topic areas , '' said a spokesperson . It 's worth remembering that Facebook trials new features and tweaks all the time , and this may not roll out to everyone if the early testers do n't like it . Even so , it 's a sign of how Mark Zuckerberg 's social network juggernaut is adapting to changing user habits . While Facebook was awash with personal news and posts in the early days , those kind of intimate , diary-style posts have disappeared in recent years . People are now more likely to share personal stuff on apps like Instagram and Snapchat . If that 's the case then breaking news might be the way for Facebook to keep us all opening up the app on our phones - and of course that 's an area where Twitter has traditionally excelled . Both platforms have a long history of borrowing features off each other and this could be the latest shift . According to early testers , the original News Feed is still available , and you will be able to choose which news categories you see inside the app . We 'll see if people find the feature compelling enough for Facebook to launch it fully . We 've got the lowdown on the brand new HTC 10 smartphone :

It takes a brave person to predict the tech industry 's future : 10 years ago hardly anybody had heard of Facebook , Twitter was just getting started , Friends Reunited was the UK 's favourite social network and Yahoo was n't in deep trouble . But that has n't stopped Facebook for planning far , far ahead – and this week we discovered its vision for all the way up to 2026 . But that 's not all . We also discovered Steven Hawking 's plans for space exploration , experienced Amazon 's Oasis and watched an internet giant become a black hole . It 's Week in Tech ! Facebook has unveiled its 10-year plan for world domination , and it has three key elements : virtual reality , artificial intelligence and sharks with frickin ' laser beams . We 're lying about that third one : it 's connectivity . As Michelle Fitzsimmons explains , Facebook wants to bring the internet to areas where it is n't currently available via drones , planes and satellites , and it wants to `` build systems that are better than people at perception '' . The first phase of that involves chatbots on Messenger for fairly simple tasks such as finding products , but over time Facebook `` is preparing for a future where we can talk to machines , and they 'll understand us . It 's an equally exciting and eerie development '' . Yahoo 's glory days are far in the past : things are so bad there 's speculation that the Daily Mail might buy it . The company that was once king of the internet is up for sale , and Michael Hicks knows why . `` Unfortunately for the 'hoo , it ignored the value of businesses that would end up profitable : search engines . Instead , the company leased its searches out to a startup named Google in 2000 . '' Not the best decision in tech history . HTC 's new flagship , the HTC 10 , has amazing audio , great design and an improved battery – but Gareth Beavis reckons there 's something missing . The camera is n't brilliant , the system feels a little buggy and while it promises much , it `` only partly delivers '' . It 's powerful and well made , but there 's nothing particularly innovative , and `` HTC needs to bring back the innovation properly if it 's going to have a chance of getting back to the top of the smartphone class '' . The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive ereader Amazon offers , with a price tag of $ 289 US ( £269 / AU $ 449 ) . Is it worth it ? James Peckham rates the new design , `` great '' – there 's a new screen – and there 's also that enormous selection of ebooks . But he also mourns the short battery life and lack of choice when it comes to cases . `` Amazon has managed to deliver the most comfortable experience I 've so far enjoyed on a device , '' he says . `` If you 're reading for a long time you may actually get your money 's worth from the Kindle Oasis . '' If you thought sending spaceships to Mars was pretty impressive , Stephen Hawking 's latest project will blow your mind : Breakthrough Starshot will send thousands of tiny drone ships to Alpha Centauri , which is of course where all the space aliens live . Those ships will travel at 134 million miles per hour , which is the same speed Audi drivers do near schools . How will they reach such speeds ? `` By firing a hundred-billion-watt battery of lasers on top of a mountain back on Earth at a 'solar sail ' attached to the craft , fashioned from fabric only a few hundred atoms thick and about the size of a kite , '' obviously . Let 's be honest . The hoverboards we 've seen so far have n't been particularly impressive . But what about a board that can go up 10,000 feet , travel at 93mph and fall out of the sky after about ten minutes ? That 's what Zapata Racing has demonstrated , although it has n't quite hit those heights just yet . `` On the official website it 's described as a prototype device and there 's a note that says it wo n't go on sale this year , '' David Nield says . `` When it does , we 'll take two ! '' Prepare to be pwned : we 've played the Gears of War 4 multiplayer , and it 's packed with new ways for you to die . As Hugh Langley and Nick Pino report , there are new guns , new battle modes , new moves and new ways to ruin your enemies ' day . `` It 's about taking cover . It 's about tactics . It 's about grabbing and defending power weapon spawns . It 's about executing your enemies in the least humane way possible , or using them as human meat shields while you sink rounds into their teammates . '' Ratchet and Clank has been `` re-imagined '' for the PS4 . But it 's much more than a mere remake , says Emma Boyle . `` Whether you 're a fan of the series already or you 've never encountered a Lombax in your life , Ratchet and Clank strikes the balance between familiar and new content just enough to work both as an introduction and a re-introduction… if you want a fun , visually impressive and solid platforming experience , you want Ratchet and Clank .

Facebook may be busy with virtual reality , chatbots , and 360-degree cameras , but the social network has n't forgotten about your News Feed . In fact , its latest work with artificial intelligence may make change the ever-scrolling landscape of our status updates and posts . The company revealed concepts during its F8 developer conference for how AI can augment the platform . Facebook 's Applied Machine Learning team has been working on overdrive , conducting nearly 50 times as many experiments on the site 's AI algorithm a day than compared to last year , producing some intriguing uses along the way . What can all that processing power and boundless parameters do for your Facebook feed ? Well , the firm wagers that all that deep learning could come in handy in lowering language barriers , searching through image albums , and helping the visually impaired `` see '' a photo . According to Facebook , half of all its users do n't speak English , and few are fluent in the language of another group of users . One aspect Facebook 's AI is working on is the ability to understand context from speech . By being able to understand abbreviations , emoticons , or regional phrases from across the world , Facebook could instantly translate posts from friends you 've met abroad - or international news sources - with better accuracy than an average copy-paste translation tool . Another tool that would be of use to any fervent Facebook photographer is the ability to search albums by content . By typing `` snow , '' `` lake , '' or `` suede jacket '' into the search bar , the AI can actually detect images featuring those subjects , saving you from having to scroll through your post history for an hour just to show a friend that sweet jacket you took a picture of at a flea market last year . An additional application of the AI 's object recognition would let Facebook name subjects in a photo out loud for those with sight impairment . By calling out objects in the forefront and background as they scroll around the image , an imaginary copy of the photo can be formed in a person 's mind to enjoy , as well as reinforce the AI 's ability to parse who or what is being tagged in a photo . The AI 's ability to recognize subjects is also being applied to video , where a demonstration shows the machine sorting through fireworks , food , and , of course , cat videos without the need for humans to pre-tag them for content . While the tech is n't ready for the world at large yet , it probably wo n't be long before we find ourselves logging onto a more intelligent Facebook . And here we thought adding Vines as your profile picture was advanced .

Facebook 's purchase of Oculus in 2014 raised some eyebrows , but its presentation on how it plans to make VR a viable platform for social communication proved that it 's making that money work . At the firm 's F8 developer conference , the company touched on everything from taking selfies in VR to how Oculus Rift 's Touch controllers will help to make social interactions in a virtual environment a little more personable . But perhaps the biggest takeaway from the keynote was just how heavily Facebook and Oculus are pushing VR to be more than just a technology that 's fun to use alone , and something that can be experienced with other people – no matter where they are in the world . Creating an authentic presence in VR is a problem that Oculus ' research division is working to solve . Sure , you can put on an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive right now , and feel very much a part of the virtual world that you see . But what happens when you introduce another living , breathing human into the world ? Oculus tried that out with Toybox , a multiplayer tech demo of sorts that lets you and another person toss objects around and trade punches in a physics-based playground . In it , you can see rough outlines of faces and hands . There 's definitely a human on the other side of that connection , but there may as well not be based on how it 's rendered . We saw more of Facebook 's progress to make VR a more interactive , social experience at F8 2016 . It was a demo that branched further out from the Toybox playground and allowed two users to visit each other digitally . Despite being in two different physical locations , they were able to draw clothes onto each other with Oculus Touch controllers , and explore a 360-degree view of London together . It 's not too different in concept to holoportation , a feature introduced recently for the Microsoft HoloLens that allows people to join each other in an augmented reality environment . Both of these advancements show that we 're getting there , but it would be putting it lightly to say that Facebook wants to take things even further . There 's no substitute for being in the same room as the person you 're talking to . But , not only can you touch , you can also pick up on physical and behavioral subtleties in this VR environment that you 'd probably miss through a Google Hangouts video chat . During the F8 keynote , Oculus quoted anthropologist Edward Sapir by stating that these small , but meaningful gestures are `` ... an elaborate code that is written nowhere , known to no one , and understood by all . '' And , advanced as it is in its early stages , VR can not properly crack that code by putting a believable human avatar in a virtual world – yet . But by properly capturing , displaying and predicting your every movement , the social network company thinks it can make chatting virtually feel as if you 're in the same room – or as close as possible with a head-mounted display strapped to your face . Of course , it 's easier said than done . First , capture the human face as accurately as possible . To do that , Facebook shared some early results from installing a high-resolution camera onto a Rift to capture subtle mouth movements . It needs work , but it 's a heck of an improvement over flat 3D models . Then , there 's the challenge of transferring this data over a stable connection . It 's an essential ingredient in creating a believable virtual one-on-one with someone . But , as the methodology of capturing every last movement gets more advanced , the amount of bandwidth required to pipe them through to the other side will likely skyrocket . Facebook is so interested in capturing these minute , uniquely human movements that it built another off-the-wall experiment to get even better at it . The Panoptic Studio is an igloo-looking dome with cameras capturing its subjects inside from every angle . It 's highly sensitive at tracking movement , even when it is n't coming from a person . The idea here is to intensely study the way we tend to act in various situations , social or otherwise . Ideally , the predictive learnings gathered from the studio will work to both make for more convincing social engagement in future VR apps , as well as lighten the load on the hardware-intensive capturing side of the process . Ever since its acquisition of Oculus , the question on everyone 's mind has been : `` So , when will we see a fully virtual version of Facebook ? '' The answer , just like the arrival of the Oculus Rift was , has been a long time coming , but is still a long way off . We saw an early glimpse into the future of Facebook in VR and , thankfully , it wo n't just be a bunch of menus or Candy Crush invitations . Which virtual reality headset is right for you ? See for yourself :
App development for Windows 10 has been excruciatingly slow , especially on the mobile side , but Facebook is hoping to give it a breath of fresh air . At Facebook 's F8 developer conference , developer advocate Christine Abernathy announced that the social media giant is teaming up with Microsoft and plans to offer its React Native tool , a platform that essentially gives apps a Facebook-powered sheen with social features including Login , Sharing , App Analytics , and Graph APIs across platforms . Basically , think of the way you can log into Spotify with your Facebook account and can share directly to the social network – only you 're doing the same things in a Windows 10 app . Facebook claims that over 250,000 developers use React Native , and the platform has played a part in the creation of 500 apps on the iOS app store . With the extra social network-powered backbone , Microsoft hopes this familiar code base will spur the development of more Windows apps . With a growing user base of 270 million , Windows 10 seems ripe for more software , including a Universal App version of Spotify to fill the Windows Store 's virtual shelves . This is the portable VR PC you probably want , but ca n't afford
Facebook today announced a bold new venture called Building 8 , and it 's tapping none other than Regina Dugan to lead the charge . Dugan is the former director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , a branch of the US Department of Defense , and most recently served as head of Google 's Advanced Technology and Projects ( ATAP ) team . ATAP is responsible for such ambitious projects as Project Tango and the modular phone initiative Project Ara . It 's famous for insanely aggressive timelines and out-there projects , both carryovers from Dugan 's time at DARPA that have resulted in some of the wildest tech we 've seen in the last few years . And it actually works , which is equally as amazing . It 's this ethos that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is amped to see come to Facebook 's Building 8 division . `` I 'm excited to have Regina apply DARPA-style breakthrough development at the intersection of science and products to our mission , '' Zuck wrote in a post . `` This method is characterized by aggressive , fixed timelines , extensive use of partnerships with universities , small and large businesses , and clear objectives for shipping products at scale . '' But wait , what is Building 8 ? According to Zuck , the group will be `` focused on building new hardware projects to advance our mission of connecting the world , '' something the company has spoken about at length during its F8 developer conference this week . Facebook is committing `` hundreds of people and hundreds of millions of dollars '' to Building 8 's projects over the coming years . Zuck said he 's looking forward to the breakthroughs that come out of the group related to the social network 's 10-year plan , particularly around VR , AR , connectivity and `` other important areas . '' It 's these areas , then , that Dugan and the new Building 8 team will focus on . For her part , Dugan described in a post that it 's a `` bittersweet day for me . '' `` Building 8 is an opportunity to do what I love most ... tech infused with a sense of our humanity , '' she wrote . `` Audacious science delivered at scale in products that feel almost magic . A little badass . And beautiful . There is much to build at Facebook… and the mission is human… compelling . '' She did , however , express sadness over leaving `` the pirates of ATAP . '' `` Each of our efforts to create new , seemingly impossible products , has been faced with intense challenges along the way , '' Dugan wrote . `` Technical challenges . Organizational challenges . Challenges that might have broken lesser teams . This is the type of work we signed up for when we built ATAP . It is terrifying because it means we have to face our fear of failure , stare it down , more days than most . So be it . '' In response to Dugan 's departure , a Google spokesperson sent us this statement : `` We thank Regina Dugan for all her leadership and contributions as part of the Advanced Technology and Projects group , and wish her the very best . '' Facebook is going all in on technologies to connect the world . Dugan is an ambitious leader who is more than capable of delivering on big promises very quickly . She appears ready to embrace the challenges Facebook has laid forth , and it 'll be amazing to see the `` badass '' tech she comes up with alongside the Building 8 crew .

There was a time when you could only talk to another human face to face ( well , unless you were shouting from a distance ) . Technology changed that : first Bell 's telephone , then messaging ( synchronous or asynchronous ) killed the voice and now chatbots promises to replace humans in conversations . Truth be said , m2m ( mobile to mobile ) communications - where humans are entirely excluded - have happened for decades , so the chatbot/human interaction sounds like a step backward . Facebook 's announcement yesterday will not only throw bots in the mainstream , it also forces the rest of the competition - Microsoft , Google , Amazon - to do the same . Zuckerberg will also constantly enhance them using artificial intelligence to create a quasi-omnipotent and omniscient non-human entity that knows everything about everyone . Sounds like God , right ? It is almost impossible at this stage not to think about the Matrix ( see 10 reasons why Facebook could be building the Matrix ) , which Facebook seems to be building . It 's yet to acquire discrete sensor technology but that 's probably next on their list . What makes Facebook 's bot army more frightening than any others is sheer scale . If Facebook was a country , it would be - by a wide margin - the biggest in the world with more than 1.6 billion active users , with 90 % of them accessing it via mobile on a daily basis . Being able to know almost everything about a quarter of the world 's population , in near real-time , is already Orwellian but the deployment of chatbots on a worldwide scale will ensure the sort domination that Google and Microsoft can only dream of , in that , they both are platforms and not killer apps . Facebook is both the platform and the killer app . But I fear that its goal goes beyond just that . Facebook wants you to spend more of your time on its platform . We already spend around a fifth of all time online on Facebook , that 's around 20 minutes per day , which is just 5 % of our active daily period ( assuming you sleep eight hours a day ) . Facebook @ work , Instagram , Oculus Rift , Free Basics and Instant Articles will ensure that this percentage keeps up growing and growing . In Washington Post 's Teddy Amenabar 's enlightening post on how `` Facebook is slowly eating the rest of the Internet '' he ends the piece mentioning that Facebook wants to `` become the internet '' . I disagree . I think Facebook wants to become more than that . For its long-term survival and for the benefit of its shareholders , it needs to increase its reach either organically or by acquiring/emulating competitors as well as increasing the time you spend on its properties . Zuckerberg already plans to get five billion people on Facebook by 2030 . In other words , if you 're not Facebook-ed by 2030 , you will be in a minority . Given that Facebook doubled its reach in the past five years , we would n't put this goal past it . And chatbots are a fundamental piece of the puzzle . Encouraging humans to interact with non-human entities on a daily basis is likely to have devastating consequences on the societal fabric as all interactions will be algorithmically defined but it will allow Facebook to know us better , better than even ourselves or Google . Facebook does n't want to control or enslave us , but rather influence us ( and our decisions ) by learning more about our network and ourselves , delivering conversations ( commercial at first ) that really resonates with us and even predicting/anticipating what we could do next . What comes after chatbots ? Well , how about a Facebook Avatar of yourself that replicates your emotions and feelings on the social network when you ca n't do it . A bit far-fetched ? Sure . But then if Facebook can influence you ...

The flagship image of any social media account - the profile pic - is everything . Waiting for the most opportune lighting , camera angle , and hair day , however , can be a painstaking process , so why commit to a single static image when you can have an entire video adorn the top of your profile instead ? At least , this is the thinking for Facebook , which announced today that users can now turn to third-party video apps to create and upload a moving profile image as their profile pic . Thanks to Facebook 's new Profile Expression Kit for developers , users can chuck out the conventional selfie in favor of short , .GIF-like videos with a few taps of a button . The new pic program is currently in beta , but a select number of partners like MSQRD , Boomerang , lollicam , and Vine are already showing off the next wave of profile photos on Facebook 's official announcement page . Integrating the Profile Expression Kit also allows developers to get a direct attribution on Facebook when users post a video profile through their app , giving them a shout-out alongside all those fresh likes and comments . Facebook added motion to its profiles back in September , but the sheer amount of customization and content that other apps bring adds a whole new level of creativity to the News Feed . That said , if the current state of Vine is anything to go off of , we ca n't help but brace for a litany of tired memes taking over our friends ' faces during the course of the coming months .

If there 's one thing we know about Facebook , it 's that it 's always looking at what 's coming next ( acquiring Oculus , anyone ? ) . The social network may have chatbots on the brain right now , but CEO Mark Zuckerberg and a cadre of Facebookites spoke profusely about what 's on the horizon , both near and far , during the F8 developer conference on Tuesday . The immediate future is full of Messenger bots , Live video on all devices , and 360-degree cameras , but it 's in the long view where we see the threads of Facebook 's plan for connecting the world come to their apex . Zuckerberg laid it all on the table by literally showing us the company 's 10-year road map . It tells of a company that has a clear vision of where it 's headed and many modes to get there , all of which extend well beyond the blue walls of its flagship service . `` Over the long term , we 're focused on three major areas , '' Zuck said . Connectivity , AI and VR/AR , to be exact . We 're already familiar with Facebook 's interest and intent in connecting its next several billion users . Services like Free Basics , which is now at 25 million users in 37 countries , are helping bring internet service ( and by extension , Facebook ) , to people that have n't had access to it before . Facebook Lite , a pared-down version of the 'book that runs on 2G phones , is now at 100 million users and is Facebook 's fastest-growing product ever . But it 's also building autonomous drone planes and satellites and developing terrestrial solutions to bring the web to more people . It 's not just in apps that Facebook plans to take over the world , but in our very infrastructure . Lasers are also on Facebook 's road map , which Zuck ( conveniently ? ) skipped over . It 's likely nothing nefarious , but , apparently , lasers are coming , and they will connect us . Facebook is dedicated to its mission of bridging the gaps between people through the internet and connected services , and rather than sit back and wait for others who typically control such things to get with the program , it 's taking matters into its own hands . So far , what it 's cooked up seems to be working . Once its planes , satellites and infrastructure get off the ground , even more people will be hooked up to the Facebook-verse . Zuckerberg said that as far as AI is concerned , Facebook wants to `` build systems that are better than people at perception . '' It 's a tall order , but one the social network is strategically laying the groundwork for . Already there was a major AI development last week when Facebook announced a feature that lets blind and visually impaired users `` see '' a photo on the site . Today , it lifted the veil on chatbots for Messenger , and while they 're not hyper-intelligent beings , it 's yet another move to deliver artificial intelligence to our daily devices . Bots will be fairly limited to start , only able to engage in relatively simple though pleasantly presented repartee with users to help them buy shoes , book flights or update them on the weather . But Facebook is also opening the door for true human-like interactions between man and machine . In addition to the Send/Receive API that most Messenger chatbots will likely be built on , Facebook is letting developers utilize its M AI platform with a new bot engine called Wit.ai . It 's a move akin to Microsoft 's new Bot Framework announced last week during Build , but with its own twist . `` Wit.ai 's Bot Engine will enable developers to build more complex bots that can interpret intent from natural language , and continuously learn to get better over time , '' a Messenger blog post read . Bots built on Wit.ai , then , will be able to interpret more conversational statements from users and anticipate what they 're saying over time . Typing , `` I 'm pretty hungry '' may not seem like a ground-shaking statement , but a sandwich shop bot built on Wit.ai will know what you mean and offer to order the turkey and avocado sandwich you always get , hold the mayo . I do n't foresee most developers going heavy on Wit.ai just yet if only because of the extra leg work involved and not knowing how many businesses will be interested in bots at all let alone really smart ones , but Facebook is preparing for a future where we can talk to machines , and they 'll understand us . It 's an equally exciting and eerie development . Finally , Facebook 's 10-year plan takes us back to a purchase it made in March 2014 . `` I think virtual reality has the potential to be the most social platform , because you feel like you 're right there with the person , '' Zuckerberg said towards the end of his keynote . He had just shown a clip of two people playing a game in the same VR room , though neither of them were physically anywhere near each other . Virtual reality is happening now , however , with the release of Oculus Rift and HTC Vive . So what does Facebook/Zuckerberg see as the next , next big thing ? From the looks of the glasses above , shown onscreen during the keynote , it 's augmented reality . It makes sense for Facebook to have its eyes on AR : make the hardware as unobtrusive as possible , and make it as compelling as possible , and people will flock to it . While Zuck did n't have an official announcement on the AR front , he clearly seemed excited for the tech 's potential . Is a Facebook-funded HoloLens rival in the works ? Speaking to the future of VR and AR in general , Zuck predicted that many expensive devices in the physical world , like TVs , will one day `` just be $ 1 apps . '' If you 're tantalized - or terrified - by Facebook 's 10-year to-do list , remember , it 's still a decade before we 'll likely see any of this . But while Zuckerberg is keeping it realistic , these are no fever dreams soon to be forgotten . `` This will take a long time to make it work , '' Zuck said , `` but this is the vision and this is what we 're trying to get to .

Facebook is knee deep in virtual reality and it seems like a natural progression for the social media company to announce its own self-built 360-degree camera called the Surround 360 camera . Unlike other 360-cameras made for professional and consumers , the Surround 360 camera is a strictly reference design for high-end video capture . The all seeing camera utilizes a 17-camera array – 14 wide-angle cameras along it circumference with fish-eye camera looking upwards and two more on the bottom . Using web-based software , Facebook claims its camera can also stitch and render the 360-degree footage in real time . The resulting footage is meant to be seen using a VR headset , and movies essentially render at 8K for each eye and at a silky smooth 60fps . It 's easy to see Facebook is taking 360-degree footage to a whole new level . Externally , the camera looks like a miniature alien saucer and this is to make room for all the cameras as well as the internal processing hardware . Facebook claims the Surround 360 is the best designed camera of its kind with the ability to record for multiple hours without overheating . That said , the social network says it 's not interested in getting in the camera business , instead it has developed the camera as an open source platform for developers to use as a model . Though you wo n't see it on GitHub until later this summer . ... developing
At its F8 developer conference , Facebook announced that Save is now capable of collecting all of the delicious internet content that you want to save for later reading . Similar to other content aggregating apps , like Pocket , Facebook will soon be implementing a `` Save to Facebook '' button across the web to make it easy to bookmark stuff that you want to read some other time . When you click on the `` Save to Facebook '' button , whatever you 're currently checking out , whether it be an article , product or video , will be sent to your Facebook account . The Facebook app will soon be updated to include a spot for this saved content in the navigation bar . This is a bold move because it puts a tremendous amount of pressure on already-existing apps , like Pocket , that have been doing this sort of thing for a years . Not just that , it 's an interesting effort to keep Facebook users inside of the app longer than usual . We 're on the ground at F8 2016 in San Francisco , CA to bring you the biggest news from Mark Zuckerberg and Co . Now , for something completely different .
Facebook Live video is a huge part of the social network 's future , and today we learned that it 's coming to all devices . Facebook is opening up the Live API so the ability to stream can be built into any device . Currently , Facebook Live is on iOS and Android , so we 're talking about even more products that extend beyond mobile . Standalone cameras are an obvious next step , and to that end Facebook announced the Mevo camera as the first camera with integrated Live-streaming abilities . Built by Livestream , the Mevo lets users sync to their Facebook account with a tap and start streaming almost instantly . The camera costs $ 399 , but you can save $ 100 if you pre-order one today . But even more awesome is that Live streaming is coming to drones . Facebook demonstrated how Live will look when it 's soaring above the ground with a DJI drone recording the F8 developer crowd Tuesday . An update to the Go app coming to Phantom drones will let pilots start streaming and interact with viewers as they fly . Another tidbit about the Live API : media organizations can mix video into their broadcasts and respond to users comments as they roll in . Live video streaming got a massive boost last week with new features centered around interaction , discovery and search . Now that any device can stream straight to Facebook , even more users - and more interesting videos - should start populating News Feeds everywhere . Techradar tries social media in virtual reality :
Facebook has announced what we all knew it would : chatbots for Messenger . Using the new bots for Messenger Platform , developers will be able to build tools so that customers can chat with businesses in the phone app , rather than needing to call a 1-800 number or email customer support . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg used an example of 1-800-Flowers on stage at the F8 developer conference Tuesday , demonstrating how a user could order flowers straight from Messenger . They 'll also be able to shop for items like shoes , as Zuck showed on stage , or order a burger . Other partners include Bank of America , CNN , eBay , HP , Staples , StubHub , Thrillist and Zendesk , plus 25 more . Bots will also provide updates on automated subscription for helpful stuff like the weather and traffic updates from partners . Bots for Messenger can host rich media , such as interactive bubbles ( ooo ! ) , images and special messages . Bots will pull up a pic and details about that shoe from Spring you 're interested in , plus give you options to buy , see more links or ask a question about said shoe . Users will have a number of avenues to chat with business bots , including sponsored ads . Yes , businesses will be able to put ads into your News Feed that include call-to-actions to chat with a bot to learn about a new product , for example . It may turn out to be a useful way for customers to connect with a new business , but if it wanders into the realm of spam , Facebook will have a problem on its hands . I expect it will proceed with caution here , but it 's something to be aware of . Speaking of spam , users will have the option to mute or block messages from businesses if they choose . There will be a set of guidelines bizzes need to adhere to so they do n't abuse bot usage . Businesses will be able to utilize Messenger plug-ins on their websites or email newsletters . `` Send to Messenger '' will send customers receipts or shipping updates in a message , while `` Message Us '' will take customers to a chat via a deep link . There 's also something called customer matching , which basically means that any alerts customers are getting via SMS text from business will now come via Messenger chat if they agree to the option . The Messenger Platform is still in beta , so users wo n't start seeing billions of bots bobbing up any time soon . Still , the bot revolution is certainly underway . Techradar tries social networking in virtual reality :
Not content to let Facebook 's new chatbots do all the talking on Messenger , today it was announced that the Facebook platform would share a deeper integration with file-sharing service Dropbox . While Messenger has always offered the ability to share photos and video from your phone directly , the new integration will allow you to instantly share files stored on your Dropbox account via the platform , without leaving the chat window . What 's more , sharing photos and videos will automatically show the image , rather than just a link . For anybody with their entire photo library backed up to the cloud platform , this will help simplify sharing in a big way . This announcement is the latest in a long list of third party integrations for the messaging platform , from hiring an Uber to sharing Spotify tracks . To link your Dropbox account with Messenger , you 'll need the most recent version of both apps on iOS or Android . From there , you 'll be able to access Dropbox files from the More option in Messenger .

Facebook is widely expected to announce chatbots for businesses in Messenger during its F8 developer conference Tuesday , and now we have proof that bots are coming . Several techradar staffers spotted a new Bots and Businesses section when searching for people in the Messenger app . One editor had an older version of Messenger on her phone and only the `` Businesses '' section popped up during a search . After updating to a new version of the app , however , `` Bots and Businesses '' replaced it . We have n't yet been able to confirm whether the new Bots and Businesses search result shows up on Android , but it does appear on iPhone in both the UK and US . While we do n't see any active bots at the moment , this appears to be where businesses that use chatbots will live . Here 's the Bots and Businesses section on the newest version of Messenger for iPhone : And here 's the set of results on an older version of Messenger for comparison : The evidence points to the impending arrival of Facebook Messenger chatbots , though it wo n't be official until Facebook makes the announcement Tuesday . We 've asked Facebook for comment on what we 're seeing , and will update this story if and when we hear back . Given an announcement is due in less than 24 hours , we 're not expecting much . The announcement of tools to build chatbots , to take place during F8 , was first reported by TechCrunch last week . Instead of businesses needing to develop a chatbot on their own or seek out a tech-savvy person to build one for them , Facebook is providing bot-building tools and Live Chat web plug-ins to developers , according to the site . Devs will then be able to create chatbots for businesses they serve , and businesses will essentially have a directory of bot makers to tap . The chatbots wo n't be super-smart AI machines , but rather field fairly simple queries from customers . It 's like a 1-800 number , only now the conversation takes place in a chat app on your phone . There is , however , a `` Structured Messages '' feature that lets the bots respond with more detailed information - such as with a URL - instead of simple text . The Live Chat feature will reportedly take users who want to contact a business to Messenger and let them carry out a conversation with a real person there . We 'll hear more about chatbots during F8 's opening keynote beginning at 10am PT/1pm ET/6pm GMT . CEO Mark Zuckerberg will do the honors , but the chatbot chatter wo n't stop there : one of the first sessions after Zuck 's keynote is called `` Messenger : Connecting People and Businesses . '' Hugh Langley , Salwa Azar and Cameron Faulkner contributed to this report Techradar explores social networking in virtual reality :

If you find yourself unsure which parts of your Facebook feed are the real-deal posts or just conveniently placed ads , you 're not alone . Facebook announced today that it 's taking new measures to point out sponsored content . That is to say , posts made by media groups , celebrities , and what the company calls `` influencers '' that mention specific products , brands , or sponsors . The move is designed to distinguish these posts from those written by normal users , a.k.a . your actual friends . The changes to Facebook 's branded content and ad policies , put into effect immediately , will require certain publishers to tag sponsors in a post , similar to how users tag friends in a post or photo . In addition to the branded content tag , Facebook is also updating its guideline to prohibit content that exhibit `` overly promotional features , '' such as constant watermarks or pre-roll ads in a sponsored video . The policy also bans featuring third-party brands or products in the publisher 's profile picture or cover photo , instead encouraging endcards , product placement , and marketing logos used in a more sensible fashion . The line between a buddy and a business has blurred when perusing Facebook - especially as the company just finished rolling out a feature that lets users chat it up with companies like an old high school classmate - so the clarification is certainly welcome . The reining-in of sponsored content may help Facebook with one of its ongoing issues : a dwindling supply in original content . As reported by The Information , the social network is facing a steady decline in original content as the News Feed became inundated with stolen memes , Twitter screengrabs , Vines compilations and , of course , sponsored posts . Such are the problems when so much of your product is built on algorithms and advertisement , but Facebook 's recognition of the issue could make it an easier place to browse . I personally would have settled for banning the litany of `` custom '' T-shirt stores that perpetually crop on on my Feed , but this is good , too .

By now you 've heard of Facebook Live 's new features . But if you thought that was it for Facebook video news for the week , you were wrong , my friend . The social network announced more Live-related news on Thursday , namely tweaks to search and other ways to help users find more videos . Now when users search for Trending topics , if there 's video available , a little red `` Live '' icon will appear next to that topic . A quick click will take users straight to the Live video . The same little red icon will also now appear next to topics with video available in the Trending box know that lives on the right side of your News Feed . Facebook said users should only expect to see `` a small handful '' of Trending topics with Live video to begin with , but that should grow as more people start broadcasting . You know the new Live video home Facebook announced for its mobile app on Wednesday ? It 's getting its own dedicated search experience , too ( and looking more and more like YouTube ) . Videos from across Facebook will pull up when you do a search using a few keywords in the bar along the top . You 'll see videos from both public figures and friends here , though not videos from people you do n't know . So , just be aware you wo n't see videos from regular users you are n't connected to appearing in search results , and vice versa .
When Facebook created a separate Messenger app , it made a point that it sees the service as a solid standalone communication app . Today , Facebook is taking things one step further with Messenger Codes . The new feature lets you find other people by simply scanning their unique code , Snapchat-style . No phone numbers necessary , and you do n't even need to be Facebook friends to connect . Additionally , Facebook is adding personalized links that can be shared . This is more useful if you 're a business owner : people can click your link and instantly start talking shop . Also , if you connect to someone via their link instead of searching their name , you 'll know you 're definitely speaking to right person . This all ties into the announcement that Messenger now has more than 900 million monthly active users . Which , you know , is quite a lot .
Facebook is planning on carving out a fresh revenue stream via its Messenger app , with the introduction of an option to chat with businesses directly from within the service . Business Insider ( BI ) spotted the move , with Facebook adding a section for 'Suggested Businesses ' underneath the search bar where you can hunt out people and groups . Messenger suggests some 20 companies that you might wish to talk with , including the likes of Lyft and Chase , although as BI notes , a lot of the businesses presented seem rather obscure right now ( including the likes of small town US newspapers ) . Obviously this is a feature which Facebook is still working on , and indeed this may just be an experimental rollout of the system to a small number of users which happened to include the reporter 's account , with the social network testing the waters . That idea is further reinforced by the fact that the companies highlighted for chat do n't necessarily support chat features – when BI tried to chat with Lyft , the reply received simply indicated that the company did n't support chat . Of course all this will change in the future when the feature is fully rolled out ( which it presumably will be ) , and it 'll be extra cash for Facebook as doubtless the idea will be to charge organisations to be highlighted for chat . Facebook is thinking more and more about businesses these days , and of course has Facebook at Work on the boil – the service has n't officially launched yet , but should do very soon ( it 's already being tested quite widely ) . Again , that will have a monetisation angle , with companies being charged for Facebook at Work premium services such as analytics and tech support . For the employee , the service will be broadly the same as everyday Facebook , but with bolstered security – and of course you can forget about playing games like Candy Crush .

Like it or not , Facebook Live is n't going anywhere anytime soon . In fact , Facebook 's answer to Periscope is being imbued with a host of new features that will enhance the platform even further starting today . The features focus around interaction , sharing and discovery . Some even take Live from its sort-of vanilla flavor of the moment to something much more fun . But most importantly , the new features will likely be welcome additions to everyday Facebookers who are n't keen to broadcast to their entire friend list , or who want more ways to discover videos and engage with someone once they 've `` gone live . '' To that first point is Live for Groups and Events , both of which are heading out the door today . As the names suggest , users can now broadcast to a specific Group , such as one for fitness , or an Event , like a birthday party with family members who could n't make it . Users can even create an Event to schedule a live Q & A , Facebook suggests . Personally , I 'm hesitant to stream a video that 's viewable by everyone I know on Facebook , but if I can stream with family who I know have Facebook but may not Skype , I 'm more likely to use Live than I would otherwise . It 's a smart addition that will probably help some users feel more comfortable with trying the feature . Right now , the only way to interact with a Live broadcast is to Like it or comment . Facebook is changing that by introducing new ways to show how you really feel during a stream . Live Reactions bring the same bubbly Reactions Facebook introduced to the News Feed to viewers , letting them respond to a video with a 'Love ' , a 'Haha ' , a 'Wow ' , a 'Sad ' or an 'Angry ' as they 're watching it . The reactions will pop up on top of the video and will disappear soon after they 're posted ( like Periscope 's hearts ) , so viewers and broadcasters know what people are feeling . There 's a personal touch , too : If you 're reacting to someone you know , then your profile pic and a little starburst will appear before your reaction does . Facebook is also setting up a replay of comments for videos that are n't live any longer . Previously when someone was Live , a stream of comments rolled by as they were posted . When the broadcast wrapped up , those comments were still readable , but in a static state , just like a comment on a regular post . That changes today as Facebook will replay comments as they happened during a live broadcast when someone rewatches the video later . Facebook is also rolling out Live Filters for iOS . It will start with five and has n't said what they 'll be , but it should give users a more creative way to personalize their videos . More will be added later on . The creative juices do n't stop flowing with filters , though : the social network will add the ability to draw and doodle on a Live video `` soon . '' Hear that , Snapchat ? Last , but definitely not least , is a new set of sharing and discovery features . You can now invite a friend to watch a live broadcast , sending them an invite someone straight from a live video . Just select the new Invite icon , pick a pal , and a push notification will make its way to your amigo . If you 're irked that you missed a cool broadcast or ca n't seem to find any you like , there 's now a dedicated hub on the Facebook mobile app where you can find Live videos from a variety of users . Here , you can see videos from friends , people you follow or topics you 're interested in , as well as search for live and non-live videos . Or , if the mood strikes , you can go live yourself . To get to this Live video home , click on the new video icon in the mobile app . Users should start seeing it roll out today . Finally , to wrap it all up , a new Facebook Live Map is coming to desktop . This will give those on a laptop or computer a visual representation of public live broadcasts taking place around the globe . Users will start seeing all these new features on iOS and Android over the coming weeks , and Facebook promises even more Live improvements are on the way .

Facebook has launched a new tool to help the blind and visually impaired help `` see '' images on its site . While a number of assistive technologies are already available to help the blind read the contents of a screen , understanding the content of images is obviously a lot more difficult . Starting today , Facebook will describe the contents of photos to the blind and visually impaired using a tool it calls `` automatic alternative text '' . The tool , which will work on iOS devices in English from today and will come to Android , the web and other languages soon , will dictate `` a list of items a photo may contain '' as the user swipes from picture to picture . Until now , screen readers would simply read out the name of the person who had posted the picture and announced `` photo '' . Now , users will hear the app say , for example , `` Image may contain : Tree , two people , sky , outdoor , etc '' . Facebook 's object recognition technology is based on a neural network with billions of parameters and which is , Facebook says , trained with millions of examples . The more pictures that Facebook 's software scans , the more intelligent it will become . Of course , we 've been seeing the benefits of Facebook 's object recognition technology for a long time , recognizing our friends ' faces and differentiating between people and objects . Facebook 's automatic alternative text is an impressive and important step forward for the social network . It 's still early days for the technology , but `` While this technology is still nascent , '' said Facebook , `` tapping its current capabilities to describe photos is an important step toward providing out visually impaired community the same benefits and enjoyment that everyone else gets from photos .

Egypt abruptly blocked Facebook 's free internet service , Free Basics , last December , and now we may know why . Apparently , the social media giant would n't let the government use it to spy on users . Facebook has positioned Free Basics as a humanitarian project , giving users access to certain websites without needing to pay for the service or for data . The accessible sites are chosen by Facebook with input from carriers offering the service , and is currently available in more than 35 countries . More than 3 million users had signed up for Free Basics in Egypt before it was banned , with more than 1 million using it to log onto the internet for the first time , according to Facebook . At the time , it was unclear as to the reason why the Egyptian government had banned the service , and was assumed that it was due to concerns that Free Basics violates the principles of net neutrality , which is what led the service to also be banned in India as well . In fact , speaking to Reuters , Egypt 's Ministry of Communication implied the very same thing , citing regulation issues . `` The service was offered free of charge to the consumer , and the national telecommunication regulator saw the service as harmful to companies and their competitors , '' said Mohamed Hanafi , a spokesman for the ministry . However , anonymous sources speaking to the news agency say that it was actually banned because Facebook refused to give the Egyptian government permission to use the service for surveillance purposes . The sources did n't reveal the details of what the Egyptian government was asking of Facebook , or how it planned on spying on users in the country , but implied it involved circumventing the service 's security . Whatever the reason , Facebook Free Basics remains banned in the country . If spying remains on top of the government 's features request , we doubt we 'll see a change in its relationship status with Facebook anytime soon .

Facebook Messenger is looking into adding end-to-end encryption - a move that would improve user privacy but also hinder Facebook 's other plans for the app . The feature would be opt-in and expected out within the coming months , sources told The Guardian . However , preventing Facebook - or any authority , for that matter - from peeking in on your messages could inhibit the service 's venture with machine learning . Facebook 's recently announced chatbots , which can perform tasks ranging from gather news to ordering tickets within the app , become less effective if they ca n't intuit more about the user by accessing their personal data . Google ran into similar concern when it announced Allo - its own take on the messaging app that utilizes the same encryption technology as Facebook-owned communication bigwig WhatsApp . Unlike WhatsApp - which automatically encrypts all messages and ca n't be switched off - Allo 's encryption settings are not activated by default so that special contextual features , like automatic `` smart replies , '' can still be used . A Facebook representative did not confirm if encryption was coming to the Messenger app , explaining that the company does not `` comment on rumor or speculation . ''

Facebook will start tracking non-users across the web , in its latest step towards conquering the online advertising space . Facebook delivers ads to many mobile sites and apps beyond its own using what it calls the Facebook Audience Network , a system similar to Google 's AdWords and other advertising platforms . Companies can use the targeted data they get from Facebook and take it to other places . For those of us with Facebook accounts , this has meant Facebook 's targeted adverts has been following us around the web . From today , those without accounts will also be targeted by advertisers in the Audience Network . Facebook will do this by installing cookies on people 's browsers , which will monitor your activity to better serve ads that are relevant to your interests - or what it thinks your interests are , based on what you 've been looking at . Facebook is doing this to both improve people 's experience with ads , and also help advertisers hone in on the right people . It believes its knowledge of people 's interests puts it in a position where it can offer a better advertising experience across the web for everyone . `` Advertising may be here to stay , but bad advertising like this does n't have to , '' wrote Ads and Business Platform VP Andrew Bosworth , in a blog post . `` That 's why we 're working to provide a better online advertising experience for everyone : people , publishers , and advertisers . '' If you have a Facebook account and want to opt out of tracking , you can do so by going into your Facebook Settings . Non-users can opt out via the Digital Advertising Alliance site ( the links can be found on Facebook 's site here ) or , if you 're on a phone or tablet , you can prevent it through your device settings . Alternatively , you can click the AdChoices icon next to any ad served through the Audience Network . If you 're in the EU and visit Facebook from today , you 'll be met with a banner along the top of the page informing you that the site is using cookies , which shows to comply with EU law .

Facebook and Microsoft announced today their plans to lay a massive data cable in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean . Construction will begin August 2016 and expected to finish in October 2017 . Dubbed `` MAREA '' , Spanish for `` tide '' , the cable will reach over 6,600 kilometers of ocean and will be capable of providing up to 160 terabits per second of bandwidth . It will be the highest capacity subsea cable to ever cross the Atlantic , says Microsoft . The cable will span from Virginia , a major hub for data centers , to Bilbao , Spain . The cable also builds a more efficient path to Africa , the Middle East , and even Asia . Microsoft says MAREA will bring `` lower costs and easier equipment upgrades which leads to faster growth in bandwidth rates . '' Customers can look forward to reduced latency and reliability with Microsoft 's cloud services . It makes perfect sense for Microsoft and Facebook to collaborate on such a huge project , as having increased bandwidth will benefit both companies . Microsoft runs its own cloud services like Azure and OneDrive , and Facebook is serving billions of people every day . By building their own internet cable , both companies will speed up their services without the need to work with telecoms . And telecoms should be worried , as Microsoft and Facebook are n't the only tech giants looking to control their own infrastructure . Google is already experimenting with its own fiber internet service and its pay-for-what-you-use mobile internet subscription , Project Fi . It would n't be surprising to see Google eventually lay its own transatlantic cable . Telecoms are n't completely out of the picture just yet , as Facebook and Microsoft brought on Telxius to manage and operate MAREA . Most of the bandwidth will be utilized by Facebook and Microsoft , with the rest being sold to other companies .

Facebook is obviously very keen on this live streaming thing : it 's just added options that let you fast forward to the best bits of clips and keep your live stream broadcast running for as long as you like . Now , the service is coming to drones too . We were promised this back at the F8 developer conference in April , but now the software update is rolling out across the world - it enables the DJI Go app to live stream footage from a compatible Phantom or Inspire drone . Read more : DJI Ronin-SC If you use the app on iOS , go and get the latest download now ; if you 're an Android user , you 're going to have to wait a little while longer apparently , but the same update should be arriving in the near future . Facebook is by no means the first platform to launch a live streaming service but it 's pushing the format hard . Of course the benefit of a live stream is that you see the action as it unfolds - like a live sports game rather than one that 's been recorded and that you already know the result for . DJI is n't showing any particular live stream bias - the Go app also supports the Twitter-owned Periscope format too , so you 've got a choice of options when it comes to getting your compelling drone footage out there . Just make sure you know what you 're doing with your drone , because a collision with a passenger jet is n't going to look good no matter what live streaming app you 've decided to use . Fortunately , we 've got a comprehensive guide you can check . A look at the Parrot Disco drone from CES 2016 :

Facebook is changing the way its Trending Topics works by updating the company 's guidelines and workflow . The social network faced accusations earlier this month of political bias in its Trending Topics section . The allegations came after an investigation by Gizmodo into Facebook 's practices and methodologies for curating news , where editors reportedly routinely suppressed conservative news . After an internal investigation , Facebook claims it found `` no evidence of systematic political bias in the selection or prominence of stories included in the Trending Topics feature . '' Facebook says it approves equal amounts of conservative and liberal news . However , Facebook also admits its `` investigation could not fully exclude the possibility of isolated improper actions or unintentional bias in the implementation of our guidelines or policies , '' which is pretty obvious whenever you have human curators . Facebook is taking steps to ensure political neutrality in the Trending Topics section moving forward . Humans will remain a part of the Trending Topics equation , but employees will be retrained on updated guidelines with `` more clear '' terminology . The company also promises to put in place `` additional controls and oversight around the review team . '' How news is surfaced is also getting a slight tweak . Facebook will no longer use the `` Media 1K '' list , which was a list of external websites the company used as reliable sources to surface stories that were n't currently trending . The list was used in conjunction with an algorithm to find breaking news . These changes were implemented after Facebook 's meeting with leading conservatives last week . The social network promises it will continue to be `` a platform that is open and welcoming to all groups and individuals . While Facebook 's News Feed is entirely algorithm driven , its Trending Topics section still requires human curators to ensure the validity of stories , as well as surfacing important stories that are n't trending . Some have argued Trending Topics should only be picked by algorithm , but others believe that human-created algorithms are inevitably biased in the first place .
Facebook Live is taking off , but one thing it 's lacked is continuous streams . You know , the kind that let you watch a nature cam nestled in the woods , or a 24-hour feed of a world-famous landmark , or , most importantly , puppies . Lots and lots of puppies . Mercifully , that 's all changing today as the social network is rolling out the Continuous Live Video API , which is exactly what it sounds like , as reported by TechCrunch . Whereas there 's a 90-minute limit on normal Live videos , Facebook has cracked the code on letting folks broadcast non-stop . While longer , the one drawback of continuous streams is they ca n't be replayed . It seems like a small price to pay to film something that is n't done justice in a time-limited clip , or is worth checking in on at regular intervals ( such as the aforementioned puppycams ) . Facebook is also introducing geotagging and agetagging for Live videos , allowing creators to only share broadcasts with people in a certain region or of a certain age . Earlier today Facebook announced a new engagement graph that shows viewers of a Live video replay when the most interesting moments went down , allowing them to skip ahead if they so choose . Top image credit : onetouchspark/iStock
I 'm guilty of this : Starting a Facebook Live video replay , sitting through 1-2 minutes ( or less ) of it , then clicking away because it was boring/not funny/whatever . Facebook knows there 's many more people like me who do n't watch Live videos simply because the beginning does n't grab us , and we have no idea when it does get good . To keep us fixed to our screens , it wants to do something about this video exodus . The most exciting part ? It actually can . The company is rolling out an engagement graph for Live video replays , reports TechCrunch , that shows at what moments viewers of the live broadcast had the strongest reactions . The graph is based off of Live comments and reaction emojis , and will let replay viewers skip ahead to the parts that garnered the most audience feedback . This way , folks who watch the video after-the-fact can fast forward to spots that are actually worth watching , rather than having to sit through the whole thing or guess when a reaction-worthy moment takes place . According to Facebook 's head of video Fidji Simo , about two-thirds of the time spent watching a Facebook Live video is when it 's no longer , you know , live . Users , then , are missing the live broadcast , but still want to see a video that 's saved to the site . The graph should facilitate them doing so in a more meaningful way than what 's currently on offer . If the graph looks and sounds a little bit like SoundCloud 's spikes and timed comments , Facebook 's engagement graph is definitely in the same vein . The new feature should give viewers more reason to watch Facebook Live videos - at least the most interesting parts of them - and help creators plan out their videos to include moments worth tuning into . While it sounds like an interesting new tool for professional creators to take advantage of , there 's also plenty of potential for amateur broadcasters to learn how to incorporate engagement-worthy moments into their streams as well . Some users will start to see the engagement graph starting today , while others will have to wait a bit longer . And just in case it was n't clear , the graph will only appear on videos that are no longer live .
Facebook just acquired Two Big Ears , a UK-based virtual reality audio startup , for its immersive audio technology . The company 's mission is to assist developers replicate how sound works in a three-dimensional space using a combination of speaker and sound processing technologies . Two Big Ears want to `` make VR audio succeed across all devices and platforms , '' which is great news for developers who do n't want to be locked into developing only for Facebook and Oculus , which is owned by the social network . Also great news for developers is that Facebook is making the VR development tools free to download and use . Developers previously using Two Big Ears 's 3Dception for Games will have to jump to the new combined platform , as it 's no longer a separate product . The team is working closely with Oculus to ensure its unified platform will work for all types of VR development . Do n't fret , existing Pro customers , as you 'll continue receiving support for the next 12 months . Interestingly , the audio platform will adopt Facebook 's name and not Oculus ' . The tool was rebranded to `` Facebook 360 Spatial Workstation , '' which shows Facebook 's commitment to its 360-degree videos for VR . With this acquisition , Facebook will make it easier for developers to create content for its various VR platforms , namely the Samsung Gear VR and Oculus Rift .
Meeting Dame Stella Rimmington , a former director general of MI5 , was a refreshing one albeit an impromptu five-minute one . Despite having left the organisation two decades ago , she is still considered as one of the best experts on the secret services , an avid commentator on privacy and intelligence . She was not only the first female DG of the MI5 but also the inspiration of Dame Judi Dench 's M in James Bond . Security is an excellent field for females `` who are now working in all areas of the intelligence service '' she added , on the technological , analytical and the more straightforward intelligence gathering side . `` Women are just as good as men '' , she said with a cheeky laugh . On the topic of privacy and data security , Dame Rimmington believes that the subject is not `` black and white '' . There has always been a potential conflict between our privacy and the government 's need to protect its citizens . Where the balance lies , she said , depends on how serious the threats to the nation 's safety are . The important thing being to have adequate legislation to cover the work of the intelligence and the police to gather information necessary to protect us . People have always been at the heart of data gathering and despite the immense steps forward in terms of technology , she still believes that humans , as flawed and unreliable as they may be , still have an important role to play . `` The whole world is communicating via technological means . Interception of communications , is getting more complicated and varied and our intelligence services need to keep up . I believe that there is still a need for the human element because although technology can reveal certain things , human beings can reveal different things '' . `` Nuances , perhaps as well as immediate information that you might not be able to get from technology '' . Technology and humans work hand in hand ( not literally ) . It is increasingly difficult to get human agents in certain situations because of the international nature of some of the threats . The development of human resources for these tasks , she added , is not as easy as it was decades ago . Our conversation then segued to Facebook , the biggest social networking website that knows almost all about its 1.6 billion members , something that even the FBI of Edgar Hoover and the East German Stasi were only able to dream of . They would have been `` very confused '' by the sheer amount of data being collected smirked Dame Rimmington . `` It is very difficult to imagine the people of the 1960 's being faced with today 's technological world because they would n't have understood it '' . They would n't have had the means of analysing it . That 's the point really . Faced with `` a plethora of information '' , any intelligence service still needs to make sense of it , by algorithm or otherwise , or else one runs the risk of being overwhelmed .

Enterprise software is , by and large , quite dull . Microsoft Office , a long-standing fixture in almost every workplace , has not changed much in design – bar a few tweaks around the edges – since it launched over a decade ago . Others remain much the same , too . Newer companies , like Slack or HipChat , have brought some colour and life to the office , but only focus on one very specific aspect – instant interaction – that does not permeate much beyond a specific type of employee or workplace . Facebook wants to alter all of that and the way the company is doing it could , in a few years , change how you work . The project , called Facebook at Work , is still in its early stages but , according to several people we spoke to at different companies , engagement with it by everyday employees – i.e . people outside the IT department – is off the scale . The Royal Bank of Scotland , which was one of the first companies to trial the software on a large scale , saw over 90 % of its users return to Facebook at Work , according to Kevin Hanley , who leads design at the bank . `` I think Facebook lets us communicate , discuss and solve problems that other solutions , such as email , simply ca n't , '' he said in an interview last year . `` We love the fact that Facebook at Work gives you the ability to opt-in to forums and groups you want to be part of rather than being on the receiving end of email distribution lists that you want to opt out of . '' The basis of Facebook at Work is , like Facebook at Home , the news feed , messaging , groups , photos , and everything else you 'd expect . The layout – news feed in the centre , blue bar at the top , and so on – is largely the same , albeit with a few minor changes . This , Hanley said , was why people are engaged with it : unlike Office , email , or any other application , people already use Facebook . According to the company 's most recent earnings report , the average user spends around 50 minutes per day on the social network . `` You would almost struggle to tell the difference between Facebook at Work and at Home , '' Hanley said . `` That is a very specific intent . What you would recognise as Facebook in your personal life is what you 'd recognise at work . '' That kind of engagement is unprecedented and gives Facebook a massive springboard from which to build out other applications for different environments , like the workplace . Of course , the fact people are already into Facebook can be a downside . `` The biggest challenge for us is taking it from the social 'fun ' experience to doing actual work on it , '' said Ben Sand , VP of operations at Kenshoo , in an interview earlier this year . `` I would be lying if I said that we were not struggling with that even today . '' Other companies we spoke to had similar problems , with employees spending time scrolling through the news feed rather than doing work . One person , who asked to remain anonymous because Facebook at Work is still in the testing stage , said the software can be `` distracting because there is always something new to look at . '' However , this may not be such a problem as the news feed is filled with work stuff , from pictures of products to statuses from your boss to messages from colleagues . Rather than scrolling through BuzzFeed , which is unlikely to have any work-related content , users are at least looking at semi-relevant updates .

You 've got a lot of friends , right ? Sure you do . Loads of friends - on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and more . So many friends . Friends friends friends friends friends . Unfortunately , researchers studying social media have some bad news . On average , those friends have more friends than you do . Naghmeh Momeni Taramsari is studying social media links as part of her PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University . `` Most people tend to think that they are better than their friends when it comes to intelligence , memory , popularity , and other personal traits , '' she explained . `` This perception is false , at least in the context of online social networks . In reality , our friends really have more friends than we do , on average . Moreover , our friends are more active ( post more material ) , and are more influential ( their posts are viewed and passed on more often ) . This is known as the Generalized Friendship Paradox . '' You should n't feel bad about this , because we 're all in the same boat . It 's down to the inherently hierarchical nature of these websites . People almost always follow more- or equally-influential people , they rarely follow those with fewer followers than themselves . As a result , almost all users experience the paradox - even those who are super-active and influential . `` Social networks do not simply comprise a few ultra-popular people with tens of millions of followers , followed by the masses , and who themselves only follow a few others , '' says Michael Rabbat , the other author on Momeni 's paper , published in PLOS One . `` Rather , Twitter is hierarchical in the following sense : those who have millions of connections mostly follow others with million connections . Those with thousands of connections mostly follow others with thousands or millions of connections . Those with a few connections follows others with few , thousands , or millions of connections . '' `` Apparently , it 's just the way we 're connected . ''

Facebook wears its devotion to virtual reality and 360 photos and videos on its sleeve , and now the company has posted the first-ever film shot with its new Surround 360 camera . The result is incredible . Produced by The Factory , Facebook 's in-house studio , the three-and-a-half minute Here and Now takes viewers inside one of the busiest transit hubs in the world , New York City 's Grand Central Terminal . The setting is the stuff of blockbuster movies , but eight small stories unfold before our eyes ( that is , if you rotate to them ) that glorify the ordinary and give us a look into the lives of the people who make up the vibrant Terminal 's tapestry . It 's moving , it 's captivating and , though dramatized , it feels real . When that girl walks away from her parents ... I 'm not crying , you 're crying . You can watch Here and Now on a browser - I think I 'm on my third viewing - but it 's also convincingly made for VR viewing with the Samsung Gear VR . The Facebook Surround 360 camera is open source , so any filmmaker can build and use one . Those looking to break into the burgeoning 360-degree cinematic market should be inspired by Here and Now . Head to Facebook to watch the sublime short film .

It 's been a rough week for Facebook . The social networking giant has come under fire for allegedly suppressing conservative news organizations in its Trending Topics section . Today , Facebook publicly clarified exactly how its Trending Topics section works by publishing the guidelines its editors follow . What we learned is that while Facebook does use an algorithm to find trending news , what shows up in the Trending Topics section is ultimately up to human editors . The Guardian received leaked documents that reveal just how big of an impact Facebook 's human editors have over trending news . Facebook also published its own report , corroborating the leaked documents . Furthermore , Facebook launched an investigation into its editorial team and found no evidence that anyone was suppressing conservative content . Facebook 's News Feed is entirely algorithm based , which means a bot presents you with what it believes are the most relevant stories and posts based on your behavior . By having no human curation , the Facebook News Feed algorithm remains completely objective . The Trending Topics section , on the other hand , is a hybrid of algorithm and human-based curation . Potential trending topics are surfaced by an algorithm , which looks at topics that have a sudden spike in popularity and mentions . The algorithm also incorporates a website crawler that identifies breaking news which allows news topics not trending on Facebook to be added . Here 's where things get tricky . After trending topics are identified by the algorithm , human editors are tasked with confirming that the topic is tied to a real world news event . Editors then have to write a topic description , apply a category label , and check to see if the news is national or global . The trending news is then sent to be personalized by another algorithm . This final algorithm looks at a person 's likes , location , and importance to decide who to serve what story . Facebook has become a giant platform of over 1.65 billion users and media companies have become heavily dependent on it as a traffic driver . Facebook 's colossal reach means the social network is vastly more influential than any one media company . When the original allegations of political suppression surfaced , conservative news sites cried foul , forcing Facebook to explain exactly how its Trending Topics product works . So were conservative news sites suppressed by Facebook ? No . Facebook 's official policy does not permit `` the prioritization of one ideological viewpoint over another '' and an investigation into its Trending Topics team showed no signs of political suppression . But what Facebook also revealed is that its Trending Topics section is still dependent on humans , who ca n't be 100 % objective . This is n't news for anyone working in the media business , but it is a new challenge for Facebook as it 's become a major traffic driver to news sites . Facebook has always been a platform that 's been about giving users what they want . Its algorithm is driven by what it thinks you want to see , turning your News Feed into an echo chamber of political confirmation bias if you 're not careful . Political objectivity has never been Facebook 's mission and it still is n't . Moving forward , Facebook will have to figure out if and how it can remove human bias from its product altogether .
Activision Blizzard is bolstering its eSports broadcasting network with new content to make games more watchable and understandable , and the company has further announced that it 's hooking up with Facebook to bring professional gaming to a wider audience . The company plans to kick off this collaboration with the social network at the MLG ( Major League Gaming ) Anaheim Open , a Call of Duty : Black Ops 3 tournament that starts on June 10 . This will see content piped through to Facebook which its 1.6 billion users can tune into if they wish ( presumably live action – that 's certainly the idea eventually , but the firm did n't specify that in the press statement , so it could just be highlights for this initial outing ) . Furthermore , the new features for Activision Blizzard 's MLG.tv network will also be introduced at this event . Going by the name of EVE ( Enhanced Viewing Experience ) , this includes serving up match stats , live leaderboards , highlights and insights on the game being watched . That will be useful to make things clearer for novices , but it also gives other viewers handy at-a-glance details on the match being broadcast . As part of the new content , the company is also bringing news , interviews and highlights to viewers , with slots hosted by veteran broadcaster and ex-pro gamer Chris Puckett . Facebook users can expect more MLG.tv live streamed gaming events and musings from Puckett down the line . Steve Bornstein , Chairman Activision Blizzard Media Networks , commented : `` We 're building a network dedicated to the thrill of competition and the passion of the fans . MLG.tv will play a defining role in realizing the full potential of this audience by creating meaningful , memorable and shareable content . '' In another first , Sky recently showed highlights of the Intel Extreme Masters tournament .

In case there was any doubt that Facebook was n't completely behind the virtual reality bandwagon , it was revealed today that 360-degree photos are coming to the social network . In the coming weeks , panoramic photos uploaded from a phone or 360-degree camera will become fully visible in the News Feed , Facebook-owned Oculus announced . Samsung owners can explore the images with the help of Gear VR , though the pictures can also be navigated with swipes of a finger or phone tilts should you not have a headset handy when checking out vacation photos from your buddies this summer . Oddly , 360-degree videos have been on Facebook for a while now , with the still picture variety just now catching up . Oculus also talked up the release of new content for Gear VR , including a three-part series called Nomads and Deadliest Catch VR - a viewing experience based on the Discovery Channel show that puts users in the sea-soaked shoes of fishermen braving the treacherous Bering Sea .
Samsung Gear VR , which usually plays second fiddle to the Oculus Rift , just received a number dump that gives it mega bragging rights . The Gear VR saw over 1 million users in April , according to stats released by Oculus . The headset is almost in its sixth month of worldwide availability . `` 1 Million people used Gear VR last month . Big news for VR acceptance and adoption , great for existing and future VR developers ! '' gushed Oculus founder Palmer Luckey on Twitter . The Gear VR was built in partnership with the Rift maker . Now , there 's no distinction made if these were individual headsets bought or accounts set up or whether every single person who tried on the headset was counted , but Luckey is right . It 's a good sign for mobile VR 's future if hordes are exposed to Samsung 's viewer . Gear VR is much cheaper and more widely available via Samsung Galaxy S7 purchases than the Rift and HTC Vive ( and better quality than Google Cardboard ) , so getting exposure can only help its cause - as can more content . It was revealed today that Facebook is preparing to launch 360 photos in the News Feed in the coming weeks , letting users explore panoramas or snaps taken by a 360 camera in full on their phone . To get that like-you're-there look on your Gear VR , just tap on the `` View in VR '' button when looking at a 360 News Feed photo . The headset is also gearing up for more content to join the over 250 apps it already has , including a 360 , 3D , three-party reality series called Nomads , produced and directed by Felix & Paul Studios , that documents the lives of nomadic peoples in Mongolia , Kenya and Borneo . Discovery VR is preparing to launch Deadliest Catch VR next week , literally putting viewers on deck as crew members in the wild Alaskan waters . Other improvements headed to Gear VR include an updated Oculus Home , set to arrive in June with easier discoverability . Also on the way are a What 's New section and updated library in the Oculus mobile app , again to help users find new content to consume and encourage more to use - or buy - a Gear VR .

Facebook has responded to allegations that it censored conservative publications from its Trending Topics section . A May 3 report from Gizmodo claimed Facebook had an editorial team curating the Trending Topics section , while the company outwardly claimed it used an algorithm-based methodology . The team , compromised of contractors and not Facebook employees , allegedly exercised editorial bias by dismissing US conservative news sites and injecting stories that were not trending on the social network , according to a follow-up report today . Now Facebook is addressing the controversy . `` We take allegations of bias very seriously , '' reads a Facebook statement sent to Buzzfeed News . `` Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum . There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality . `` These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives . Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another . The guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics . '' It 's important to note that Facebook 's statement does n't deny that censorship happened – it just says that it 's not allowed . Gizmodo 's story claims Facebook curators were told to 'inject ' stories into Trending Topics , even if they were n't trending . The story also alleges Facebook allowed editors to pass on stories from conservative outlets , even if they were actually trending on the social network . `` Every once in a while a Red State [ a prominent conservative political website ] or conservative news source would have a story . But we would have to go and find the same story from a more neutral outlet that was n't as biased , '' claimed one anonymous curator . This latest controversy highlights the unease between Facebook and other media companies . The social network is now a giant , with 1.65 billion active users sharing content with the service . Facebook wants users to stay engaged with its products as long as possible , but it gets content from outside media firms , which are at the mercy of Facebook 's algorithm . Facebook also introduced an Instant Articles feature , which loads a stripped down version of a news article optimized for speed . The feature angered many media outlets , as it removes advertising and relinquishes some control to Facebook . Somewhat ironically , Gizmodo 's story about Facebook alleged censorship can now be seen in the Trending Topics section .

LinkedIn is set to follow in Facebook 's footsteps by introducing Instant Articles for its membership , at least if the rumour mill is to be believed . The news comes from inside sources who spoke to BuzzFeed , claiming that LinkedIn has been in discussions with publishers with a view to implementing the system . If you 're not familiar with the idea of Instant Articles , essentially they allow publishers to put their articles up directly within the social network , so they 're hosted right there , and benefit from much quicker loading – and Facebook claims readers are much more likely to share them ( apparently they 're shared 30 % more often than mobile web articles ) . The benefit for the social media site , of course , is that users are n't leaving its confines to read the articles . For Facebook , it 's all part of its grand plan to effectively become the web for its users , and it certainly wo n't hurt LinkedIn 's engagement figures , and will help establish the network as a more solid source of business news . BuzzFeed tapped LinkedIn on the shoulder for a comment on the speculation , and actually received a response for a change , with a spokesperson telling them : `` Publishers remain a very important part of our content ecosystem and we are in regular conversations with them about new ways to work together . Our goal is to ensure we get the right content in front of the right member at the right time to deliver the best member experience possible . '' That certainly sounds like a fairly positive response and one which is far from a denial , so we could well see a similar system to Facebook 's Instant Articles popping up on LinkedIn soon . LinkedIn has over 400 million users globally , and probably considerably more than that now seeing as that figure was announced last autumn .

The world of banking is set for rapid change , with new research revealing just how keen consumers are to use new technology like wearables and cryptocurrencies for payments – and some folks would be prepared to do their online banking with the likes of Facebook or Google . A study from Fujitsu ( taking in the opinions of 7,000 European consumers ) highlighted the generally progressive attitude of banking and insurance customers . While 44 % of respondents said they still used cash on a daily basis , many are shifting to modern payment methods , with 32 % using their mobile device to pay for goods or services , and 22 % using wearables . One in five of those surveyed said they used cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin , and these were particularly strong in Eastern Europe where 44 % of respondents said they used virtual currencies . But perhaps most strikingly – and worrying for the financial services industry – a fifth of consumers said they would be prepared to use Facebook , Google or Amazon to buy banking or insurance services . On the flipside , respondents also said they would be prepared to buy more services from banks and insurance providers – a third said they would consider going with a bank for energy services , and 30 % said they would do so for broadband . Whatever happens in the future , customers are definitely expecting their bank to keep fully up-to-date with technology and new payment methods – if they fail to do so , 37 % said they 'd consider leaving their banking or insurance provider . Francois Fleutiaux , Senior Vice President and Head of Sales , EMEIA , Fujitsu , commented : `` Today 's customers are no longer guarded . When it makes interaction more convenient they are willing to embrace innovation . They may not know where they need it until it is offered , but this is where technology comes to the fore – it is the engine that is driving consumer expectations forward and the financial services sector has to live up to this new pace of change . '' Fujitsu 's survey also found that many consumers were happy to allow their bank to use their data to recommend relevant services – 47 % of respondents in fact , a surprisingly high figure . And the majority , 59 % , said they 'd be happy for their bank to use their data to lower their mortgage premium . So clearly , if savings are to be had , then data is definitely up for grabs for a lot of people .

Facebook has announced that your news feed will change to firmly put the focus back on family and friends . Facebook has come under fire for pushing partner content , but has realised that people prefer regular updates on what Uncle Richard is getting up to on his annual trip to Bahrain . In a blog post released today Facebook states that people 's news feed should then both `` inform… [ and ] entertain '' . Facebook also states that authenticity is key : `` The feedback we 've gotten tells us that authentic stories are the ones that resonate most '' . Obviously this comes a few weeks too late to impact on the Brexit discussions . However , Facebook also admits that whilst it 'Likes ' giving you more of what you want to see , it 's not without selfish reasons . Simply put , it wants to give you what you want , because you `` are more likely to spend time on News Feed and enjoy their experience '' .

I like Liking things . Most of the time , after I read an article or see some other type of amusing content online , I just want to Like it . Not share it on my News Feed , not blast it to my Twitter followers , but simply give it a thumbs up . A small virtual gesture that says , `` Nice one . '' Facebook today made a little change that , if I could give it a click-induced vote of approval , I would . The network tweaked the design of its social plugin Like button , removing the lower case `` f '' and replacing it with a thumbs up . It 's a tiny change , and will probably go unnoticed by many , but its aim is to make it easier to understand what the Like button is all about . Facebook says it 's already seen an increase in use between the new button and the old in testing , so more people should get to clicking the thumb one once it starts popping up on websites everywhere . Facebook is n't stopping there , though : it 's making all its social plugin buttons more mobile friendly , and a cleaner , flatter , more refined look better reflects the social network 's style , it says . Soon , you 'll start to see Like , Share and Comment buttons on Instant Articles , too . It 's also introducing two new Chrome extensions – Share to Facebook and Save to Facebook – to better facilitate you actually sharing and saving content you consume outside of Facebook 's walls . Facebook would rather you share and save everything from within those walls , but realizes that 's not realistic . The button changes should increase engagement , if only slightly , and modernize the look of the blue slabs that live on just about every page of the web these days . The Chrome extensions will make for quicker sharing and saving – if you use the browser , that is . As for the new Like button , I just want to say , I like it .

If you felt the only thing missing from Facebook 's 360-degree VR videos was emoji reactions then have at it - the social network now lets you post the same one-click responses you can add to any other post to VR videos as well . Actually , it 's Oculus that has announced the news , after teasing the new feature back in March . It relates specifically to watching video through the integrated app on the Samsung Gear VR , though presumably other VR headsets will get the same feature soon . Of course there 's no easy way of typing when you 've got an immersive reality box strapped to your head , so the familiar six emojis are a suitable way of reacting to what you 're seeing without breaking the flow of the experience too much . Oculus says the same reactions are coming to 360 photos in the coming weeks , TechCrunch reports . You 're also going to be able to see other people 's reactions float past your field of view , which should make the VR experience just a little less lonely . Facebook bought Oculus for a cool $ 2 billion for a couple of years ago . Find out everything you need to know about iOS 10 in less than two minutes :

The Orlando shootings of June 2016 marked the very first time Facebook decided to turn on its Safety Check feature for users in the United States . But it is never an easy decision for the company to make - Facebook is even experimenting with an automated way to turn on the feature . Safety Check gives those near an incident the opportunity to inform their loved ones that they 're safe and sound , but , despite being used 28 times around the world for natural disasters and acts of terror , so far this is the first time Facebook has seen fit to turn on the feature in the US . Katherine Woo , Product Lead of the Social Good project at Facebook explained , `` By making the decision to go beyond natural disasters , we knew that unfortunately there were so many more human-related intentional or accidental events . `` It used to be that we had to wake up an engineer in the middle of the night to break the code and fix the tool . Now we have a much easier tool for people who are trained to do it . '' Safety Check debuted in 2014 , but Facebook only begun using the feature for human created - intentional and accidental - disasters following the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks . Despite the feature debuting during the Paris attacks , some criticised Facebook for not rolling out the tech a week earlier after a double suicide attack in Beirut . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , wrote on his profile at the time , `` Until yesterday , our policy was only to activate Safety Check for natural disasters . We just changed this and now plan to activate Safety Check for more human disasters going forward as well . '' Facebook did so and used the feature further in the March 2016 Brussels attack and the Orlando shootings in June . But how does Facebook decide on what 's a big enough disaster to include within Safety Check and avoid further controversy ? To enact a Safety Check , Facebook looks at three key areas . Scope is the first topic and that 's simply how many people could possibly be affected by the event . Second is scale , which is a little more complicated . Katherine Woo explains , `` Is it threatening to health and or life ? Is it threatening to the infrastructure of the region ? Additionally could it destabilize to economic stability or even political stability in that area ? '' Finally there 's duration , which raises the question : how long an event takes place for and will it have a lasting effect on the region ? The timing of a Safety Check is more complicated than you may first expect . Does a person exactly know if they are safe when they press the button to tell their followers where they are ? `` Say there was a hurricane passing through an area , '' Woo said . `` We want to make sure we get the timing right . We want to make sure the hurricane has passed through the area such that if you mark yourself as safe , that safety is stable . '' Facebook is succeeding in covering more disasters around the world . In 2014 and 2015 Facebook only enacted the feature 11 times but less than six months into 2016 Facebook has already used Safety Check 18 times . In the future , Facebook may not use its current criteria to decide whether Safety Check is turned on . `` We really are doing our best to expand and touch more people . We 've started to test a system where we can use community 's signals to let us know when this will be relevant before an event gets big enough , '' Woo said . `` What we are doing is letting the community tell us when it 's most relevant for them to mark themselves safe and which of their friends it would be most relevant to ask as well . '' Safety Check may one day be automatically enacted by an algorithm at Facebook found by successive posts in a certain area on the same topic . But the testing only began on June 2 so it 's likely Facebook employees will continue to be the ones to press the button using the specifics of scope , scale and duration . Safety Check is a useful feature when you 're near an incident , but it 's the one thing you never want to see it appear in your news feed .

Facebook 's Messenger app is one of the most popular messaging platforms in the world - it has over 900 million people using it - but the most recent changes are set to surprise some of its users . When you use Messenger , the app gives you a list of all your messages in order with the most recent messages at the top , but that 's now going to change Facebook has announced in a blog post that it will bring a Favorites section into your Messenger to give you a quick option for those you message most often . One of the other big changes is that those celebrating a birthday will appear in your Messenger feed so it 's easier than ever to message them on their special day . There 's also plans for an Active Now section that will give you an option to message whoever is online at that exact moment . It 's likely Facebook will bring in some of its new chatbots as well . Facebook will begin rolling out the feature in the coming days , so expect your app to update very soon .

Facebook Messenger for Android is getting a major update today which brings back SMS support . If you 're experiencing déjà vu , it 's because Facebook Messenger did support SMS several years ago , but the feature was removed because no one was using it . Hopefully Facebook nailed SMS integration this time so users will find it actually useful . `` A lot of Android texting apps did n't keep up with the evolution of messaging , so we felt like we truly had to make Messenger the best SMS client for Android , '' says Facebook Messenger lead David Marcus . What 's different this time around is that Android users will be able to send voice clips , stickers and locations via text . Previously , these features required both parties to have Facebook Messenger installed . While all users will be able to receive SMS messages sent from Facebook Messenger for Android , they wo n't be able to send back any stickers , voice messages or locations unless they 're also using Facebook Messenger . Google Hangouts also supports SMS , but does it in a more integrated way . Hangouts allows users to combine their SMS and Hangouts chats into one unified thread . Facebook Messenger , however , separates SMS and Messenger conversations . SMS conversations are colored purple , while Messenger conversations are blue . This is similar to Apple 's iMessage app which shows SMS in green and iMessages in blue . Facebook hopes users will stick with Messenger for all their chat needs by adding more and more features . On top of support for SMS , Facebook Messenger also features chatbots that can help you perform tasks like ordering food or getting a ride . Facebook also removed chat functionality from its mobile website , forcing users to download the Messenger app to continue chatting with friends . The Messenger update is rolling out to Android users in `` most countries '' starting today so check the Play Store to see if you have it .

Migraine ranks in the top 20 of the most disabling medical conditions in the world , yet researchers say that it 's poorly understood , with many people failing to report it to their doctor , or not listing their symptoms comprehensively . Now , however , a team of headache researchers is hoping to improve knowledge around the disorder by releasing the results of a study into migraines conducted on social media . In particular , they wanted to know how prevalent phantom tastes , sounds and smells are among sufferers . A team lead by Matthew S. Robbins reached out through the Daily Migraine - a website with a message board where those with migraines discuss symptoms and treatments . Over a period of three weeks , the site used its Facebook , Twitter and Instagram accounts to ask its followers to list migraine-associated symptoms elicited by sensory experiences . Phantom smells were the most commonly-reported symptom , particularly cigarette smoke , animal scents and cleaning products . However , some reported experiencing pleasant smells like food aromas , perfume and flowers . Many also reported auditory experiences during migraines - including ringing sounds , buzzing and music . Phantom tastes were the least common symptom - with those who reported them experiencing the taste of either blood or food . `` Given the onerous physical and emotional impact of migraine , an online forum is a unique resource to the professional headache community to help us improve how we diagnose , care for and treat headache and facial pain syndromes , '' said Cynthia Armand , who contributed to the study . `` For individuals affected by these neurological diseases , an online site may provide more anonymity and a community , making it a safe place to be open and honest without fear of being judged or marginalized . '' The team 's research was presented at the conference of the American Headache Society on 10 June 2016 .

When a major data breach happens it 's expected that you might get a password reset warning from the company or service involved - but there 's a good chance you 're also going to get a similar message from other online platforms that were n't directly affected , even months or years down the line . Why ? As KrebsOnSecurity reports , services like Netflix and Facebook often analyse data leaks from other sites to check for passwords that are being used in several different places . It 's something a lot of us tend to do - even if it 's very unsafe habit to get into . Data from hacks is n't always released immediately , which is why these reset requests can sometimes appear out of the blue even when there are n't any big leaks in the headlines . Netflix , for example , has been sending out password reset requests this week in the wake of past breaches at LinkedIn , Tumblr and MySpace . `` Netflix 's forensics team has been using a tool that the company released in 2014 called Scumblr , which scours high-profile sites for specific terms and data , '' writes security expert Brian Krebs on his site . Facebook has similar tools in operation , he says . A message in your inbox does n't mean your Netflix or Facebook passwords have been hacked or exposed - both companies use secure , encrypted programs to compare your details with the leaks - but it 's likely that you 've been using the same password across multiple sites . It 's bad practice but even Mark Zuckerberg does it . It 's in your best interests to use different passwords on different apps and sites , even if you only change a few numbers or letters each time . If you do n't have the memory capacity to cope , a password manager like LastPass or Dashlane can lend a hand . Is TouchID as secure as we think it is ?

Facebook and Blizzard Entertainment are teaming up , with the gaming giant announcing today that it will implement the social network into its biggest games - a move that may also give Facebook Live , Facebook 's take on in-the-moment video , a major feather in its cap . Beginning later this month , players can log into World of Warcraft , Heroes of the Storm , Hearthstone , Diablo III , StarCraft II , and our newest addiction , Overwatch , using their Facebook credentials in place of a dedicated Battle.net account . More interesting , however , is Blizzard 's eventual plan to let players `` Go Live '' with just one press of a button , directly beaming their current gaming session to Facebook Live for their friends to spectate , comment , and even subscribe to directly from their News Feed . Not only will Blizzard 's `` Go Live '' feature make judging your friends ' play skills as easy as checking your Facebook , but it also gives the live video service a much-needed strategy for competing with the likes of streaming giants like Twitch and YouTube Gaming - accessibility . By having streams take place directly on the News Feed , finding an audience for your latest raid could be as easy as pressing 'play ' because - let 's face it - we 're constantly checking our Facebook enough as is . Having the action all take place on your Feed also bypasses the need to redirect your friends to an outside site or get the message out whenever you go live - two hurdles that budding young let's-players tend to face when starting out . Should other publishers take the bait and incorporate their own version of `` Go Live , '' Facebook 's livestream platform could easily become a worthwhile competitor to Twitch and YouTube - or at least make streaming more appealing to hobbyists who 'd prefer not to turn it into a day job . Blizzard has yet to announce exactly when its streaming features will air , but we already ca n't wait to show our buddies when we finally make a Play of the Game in Overwatc - even if it means making them witness a few embarrassing misplays in Hearthstone as well .

Facebook and Facebook Messenger have been going their separate ways as apps for quite some time now , though it 's still possible to chat through a mobile browser if you do n't want to install Messenger . Now that option is about to disappear too . Users who are messaging through the mobile Facebook website are being told that `` soon you 'll only be able to view your messages from Messenger '' . The functionality is about to get cut from the mobile app just as it was cut from the original Facebook app . That 's not good news for people who ca n't or do n't want to install Messenger on their phones for whatever reason . For Facebook , it 's a way to drag everyone over to the Messenger app , now that one-to-one messaging is becoming more appealing than staring at a traditional news feed . Messenger has its own home on desktop browsers which is n't going away but mobile users will be out of luck in a few weeks . When someone brings out a Windows 10 Mobile app , then you know they 're really serious about dominating the market . Soon the only alternative to the official Messenger apps will be Facebook Lite , which you wo n't be able to get if you 're not in a select number of developing countries . Facebook Lite highlights another reason why people might want to eschew the Messenger app : its higher data usage , thanks to all those stickers and GIFs . It 's Facebook 's platform , of course , so it can do whatever it wants with it - but it seems a shame to corral users in this way . There are plenty of alternative chatting apps out there if you think Facebook Messenger is becoming too bloated , though you might find that your next choice is also being run by Mark Zuckerberg . Check out our hands-on review of the Sony Xperia X :

Windows 10 Mobile has been having a hard time and that 's largely down to a lack of apps , with both Android and iOS offering millions of apps each , while Windows does n't even have all the big names . But you can add one more big name to the list of apps the platform does offer , because , as spotted by MSPowerUser , Facebook Messenger is now available for it . You can grab the app from the Windows Store , but it 's still rolling out and currently seems to only be available in France and Germany , so while the listing is up it may show as unavailable for you . If so you have two options , you can check back periodically , as it should hopefully be more widely available soon . Or , as Neowin reports , you can temporarily change the region on your Windows Store account to France or Germany , then once you have the app you can change it back and still freely download it from the My Library section of the store . The app is still in beta , so it may not be entirely stable , but it looks to be feature-rich , with group messaging , notifications , stickers , GIFs , photos , videos and more all included , so you can finally get the full Facebook chat experience on your Windows phone . This is great news for existing users of the platform , but is unlikely to make much difference to its fortunes , with the low market share for Windows 10 Mobile ensuring it will continue to be an afterthought for most app developers . Still , it 's promising that Facebook continues to engage with the platform at all , even if it takes its time to bring its apps over . With Instagram and WhatsApp both under the Facebook umbrella too it 's one of the single biggest and most important app developers , so as long as Windows 10 Mobile has Facebook 's support it 's going to have at least some key apps . What 's not clear is whether Facebook is supporting the platform under its own steam or whether Microsoft is making more of a push to get big apps on there . We 've contacted both companies for comment and will update this story when we hear back .

Facebook introduced its language learning `` understanding engine '' today in order to better understand how humans communicate . Facebook calls it DeepText , and what makes it so powerful is that it can analyze context of `` several thousand posts per second '' in over 20 different languages . Understanding context has been a challenge for artificial intelligence , but Facebook thinks it 's cracked it . Instead of assigning words to specific integers , DeepText uses `` word embeddings , '' a mathematical concept that preserves semantic relationships among words . What this means is that DeepText will understand `` bro '' is short for `` brother '' , and other slang . This approach also allows DeepText to understand context better . For example , if someone says `` I like blackberry , '' DeepText will look at the context of the conversation and understand whether a person 's referring to the fruit or the device . Facebook is n't the only company that 's heavily invested in artificial intelligence . Google recently announced its upcoming Allo messaging app , which leverages the company 's powerful AI to suggest replies and to analyze what you 're writing and sharing . It 's so smart it can tell what breed of dog is in that picture your friend shared with you . Facebook has a similar idea with its Messenger chatbots , which users can interact with to do simple tasks like ordering a pizza or finding news . They 're not very good at the moment but Facebook DeepText should help them get a lot smarter . Imagine chatting with a friend and mentioning that you need a ride . Facebook DeepText automatically recognizes that you need a lift somewhere and will offer to order an Uber for you . It 'll even recognize when you 're selling something on Facebook and offer to make a sale posting for you . Facebook DeepText is already being tested on some Facebook products like Messenger . Expect to see Facebook 's apps and services get a lot smarter in the near future .

Do you use Facebook ? Of course you do . And so do 1.7 billion people every month . That 's the latest user figure from the social network , which released its Q2 earnings report today . As has been the case for many quarters now , Facebook is doing quite well for itself . Numbers continue to go up , it 's making more money per user , and it continues to beat analysts expectations , which always makes Wall Street happy . As if nearing 2 billion monthly active users is n't enough , there are more staggering numbers to gawk at from the company 's latest financials , including what 's going on with Instagram and WhatsApp : Its user growth in regions where it 's available will stagnant , but the fact that Facebook is growing how much it makes per user , increasing ad revenue ( mobile ad revenue was up 81 % year-over-year ) and is already thinking about how it can get more users - namely , by bringing the internet to more people - is a tremendous sign for its future . Is Facebook truly unstoppable ? There are no guarantees in life , but it will take a lot to knock the company off its game . So , what 's the secret to Facebook 's success ? While smart execution of its core products is no doubt a factor in Facebook 's continued growth , video is now the major driver for the social network , and its No . 1 priority moving forward . `` We 're particularly pleased with our progress in video as we move towards a world where video is at the heart of all our services , '' CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the company 's earnings release . He backed that up on a call with analysts , saying the `` big theme '' Facebook 's working to execute is `` to become video first . '' Social phenomenon like Chewbacca Mom attest to Facebook 's success in feeding videos for pure entertainment , while videos of heavier and sometimes graphic and tragic subject matter , such as the death of Philando Castile and attack on police officers in Dallas , Texas , show `` how live [ video ] can shine a light on important moments as they happen , '' Zuckerberg said . Video is the focus of just about every social platform right now . Twitter laid out its hopes for live video during its earnings call yesterday , but , so far , Facebook has the lead on drawing in users - and advertisers - with video . That 's not to say it 's not facing challenges , especially on mobile . Zuckerberg said that on mobile , users have a number of apps and services to choose from , including YouTube , live.ly , musical.ly , and Snapchat , and each offers different levels of video sharing , from 1-on-1 private conversations to fully public that meet different needs . It 's a tough landscape , but Zuckerberg indicated the company will focus on video production as one way to gain a leg up on competitors . It just made its Surround 360 degree camera open source , so expect more devices , tools and services centered around video from Facebook over time .

During his keynote at F8 2016 in April , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out the social network 's plan for the next 10 years . It involves , in simplest terms , connecting the entire world via the internet , and he described various ways Facebook intends to make that happen . Facebook 's strategy calls for some heady initiatives , like building its own Wi-Fi network and sending satellites to space . It 's wildly ambitious for a company often best known for baby pictures and Chewbacca Mom , and not something I gave full credence when I first heard Zuck lay it all out . Plenty of companies talk a big talk , but how many of them ever pull off what they say they 're going to ? I 'm still not completely convinced Facebook can connect all the reaches of the globe with the internet – not least because if its various efforts do n't make money , shareholders could start grumbling – but as time 's passed , Facebook has shown it 's committed to developing the tech it 's talking about . That 's the story today as Facebook announced it held the first full-scale test flight of Aquila , its solar-powered , internet-delivering drone plane , sending the aircraft soaring for 96 minutes over the Arizona desert . The test flight gave the Aquila crew a close look at the plane 's takeoff , aerodynamic design , battery and power performance , autopilot functions and how it fares in real-world conditions . Almost everything went according to plan , Facebook said in a blog post . The flight also put into perspective the challenges Aquila still faces , such as gathering enough energy from the sun for all its moving parts and keeping its batteries topped off for those times it does n't have sunlight . The obstacles do n't end there : the aircraft has the wingspan of a commercial airliner , yet one-third the weight of a car . So , while it can fly at an efficient 25mph at sea level ( commercial airliners are booking it at 200mph ) , it also bucks most of the rules of aeronautical engineering . Last but not least , keeping the entire project economical so that it really is a viable alternative to current modes of internet delivery presents another unique challenge . The Aquila team plans to continue testing the aircraft at different speeds , heights and designs , all with the aim of putting together an entire fleet that will soar the skies and beam down broadband . When it 's completely up and running , Aquila will fly for up to 90 days , delivering internet over 60-mile-wide swaths , often in areas that 've never had it before . According to Facebook , less than half the world has internet access , and 1.6 billion people live in regions that lack access to a mobile broadband network . Aquila 's accomplishment is a milestone step in further connecting the world , though I 'm acutely aware that more people with internet access ( courtesy of Facebook ) also means more people who have Facebook , which means more ad dollars going to the social network 's coffers . But leaving that aside , the test flight shows that Facebook 's ambitions are attainable , and that the internet does n't have to be confined to the delivery pipelines we 're used to . It 's often unrealistic and prohibitively expensive to build internet infrastructure in the places that do n't already have it . Yes , these planes are unconventional , but they also are n't as preposterous as they may first seem when you consider the geographical challenges of laying fiber in more remote parts of the world . One successful test flight does n't mean internet planes will fill the skies overnight , but it proves it can be done , and not just by Facebook . Google has its own internet drone plans , though we have n't seen them materialize in the same way as Facebook 's yet , as well as its Project Loon initiative . Facebook 's flight could light a fire under Google to pick up the pace of its drone development , if only to keep the social network from cornering the friendly skies . If you 'd asked anyone 10 years ago whether one day Facebook would successfully fly a solar-powered plane that delivers the internet , they 'd have said you 're nuts . Now , we 've seen it happen , and can only wonder what comes next .

Your Facebook chats are about to get a lot more secretive , if you want them to be : the giant social network has announced it 's testing end-to-end encryption and message expiration settings for Messenger on mobile . Encrypted messages , like those on WhatsApp , ca n't be read by anyone but the sender and the recipient - not even if a rogue Facebook employee wanted to snoop on your chats or the government fancied tuning in . Even if the police asked Facebook to turn over encrypted chat logs they 'd be pretty much useless . The majority of users love encryption , because it means their conversations are almost completely unhackable ; law enforcement agencies are less keen , because it stops them from monitoring suspected criminals as closely as they might like . The new features are rolling out on a `` limited test basis '' and the moment and will be `` more widely available this summer '' , Facebook says . They 're also going to be opt-in ( so not on by default , and only for mobile devices - apparently it 's too difficult to implement the same encryption on the web . `` We 've heard from you that there are times when you want additional safeguards - perhaps when discussing private information like an illness or a health issue with trusted friends and family , or sending financial information to an accountant , '' explains Facebook . Meanwhile for those who are bored of human-to-human interaction , Messenger 's bot army continues to grow : Yahoo is bringing its popular finance , weather and news services to the platform , so you can get updates right inside the chat app . Here 's how to download and setup the latest version of Android :

Earlier this year Facebook shared its vision of a chatbot-filled future - AI-powered programs working through Messenger to help us order pizza , find support with a wonky gadget or get the latest football scores . They 're kind of a cross between digital assistants ( like Google Now ) and telephone support lines . Well , developers apparently love the idea : there are already 11,000 bots available on Facebook , the head of Messenger David Marcus says . 23,000 developers have signed up to build bots too , so it sounds like there are a lot more on the way . The benefits of being able to outsource your ordering system to chatbots who never take a break and never get grumpy are obvious , but whether users are going to embrace this new era of artificial intelligence quite so enthusiastically remains to be seen . If you 've heretofore been chatting with real human beings on Facebook and fancy a change , head to this listings page and have a browse - anything with a Messenger icon next to its name has a bot , so you can start chatting with the business or brand and see if you 're able to spot the signs of artificial intelligence . Facebook is by no means the only tech company investing in a bot-filled future : you can find them inside Microsoft 's Skype apps and they 're coming to Google 's new Allo messenger app too , in a slightly different form . At the same time as announcing Facebook 's bot army is now 11,000 strong , Marcus also introduced some new tools for developers to take advantage of , including more content types ( so a bot can send a GIF in your direction ) . If you 're interested in the technical details behind bot development , there 's a new official blog to keep an eye on . Everything you need to know about buying the best headphones for you :

Mark Zuckerberg has once more insisted that Facebook is not looking to start producing the news that millions read through the social network 's feeds . Despite multiple denials Facebook remains a potential super-threat for media businesses given its enormous user base and an increasingly prominent place in how people find their news . And with the launch of initiatives like Facebook Instant Articles - an ad-lite news offering done in partnership with news outlets - the question of whether it would be easier for Facebook to launch a media wing keeps coming up . `` No , we are a tech company , not a media company , '' Zuckerberg told students in Rome 's Luiss University - according to Reuters . ' [ Facebook is ] a technology company , we build the tools , we do not produce any content '' . `` The world needs news companies , but also technology platforms , like what we do , and we take our role in this very seriously . '' Of course , Facebook 's algorithmic approach to news does fundamentally affect the industry already , tending to extend the reach of major media brands with big followings on social media . But , if the company was to start producing news - and presumably favoring it on its platform - uncomfortable questions would be raised about the ethics of a single company dictating such a significant portion of the media agenda .

Deep below the surface of Europe 's largest lake , Vänern in Sweden , Anders Brodin reaches for his diving computer . Thumbing carefully through its menus , he opens a Facebook client and composes a short message . He hits send . `` Right now , I am diving at 16.1 meters and the temperature is 15 degrees . This is only the beginning ... '' pops up on the screens of his friends around the world . This is something that divers have never been able to do before . More than a metre below the surface of a body of water , most radio communication fails . The water absorbs the signals of all but the lowest-frequency electromagnetic waves , meaning that a normal mobile phone , or even a walkie-talkie , simply would n't get any signal . But divers still need to communicate , and that 's why an extensive language of hand signals has been developed over the years . A thumbs up means `` I 'm going up '' , while a thumbs down means `` I 'm going down '' . A chopping motion at the throat means `` I 'm out of air '' , while tapping the top of the head means `` I 'm OK '' . The obvious problem with this system is that it relies on divers looking at each other . A clenched fist thrust in the direction of danger ( used to signify a hazard ) , is not much help if your dive buddy is distracted by an octopus . That 's why recreational diving remains 40 to 60 times more dangerous than driving a car . Enter Aqwary , an eight-person Swedish startup hoping to revolutionise underwater communication , making diving safer in the process . Two years ago , the Linköping-based company launched a palm-sized diving computer capable of creating subaquatic social networks of up to 70 divers , passively sharing information about their location and air supply status . The device , called the Smart Console , uses four hydrophones ( underwater microphones ) to communicate with any other unit within 100 metres . Data is sent over ultrasound - the same method that most marine life uses to communicate . `` If you could hear it , it would probably sound like one of those old modems from the Eighties , '' says Brodin , the company 's co-founder and president . The Smart Console , which has a 536MHz processor and a 3.7-inch AMOLED display encased within a simple waterproof exterior , displays the direction and distance of any divers within 100 metres . Users can send basic text messages to each other , and it even has a small app store where it 's possible to download digital compasses , more advanced dive computers , and dictionaries of fish and dive sites . There 's even a version of the old Nokia classic , Snake - an idea that came from one of the testers . `` He did a lot of long deep dives , and then To avoid getting diver 's sickness , you have to go up very slowly and stay at six or three metres for a long time , '' Brodin says . `` He was asking if we could n't make a game for him , so he would have something to do while he was waiting . '' Now , however , Aqwary is launching a new product - a buoy that can link up the underwater world with the surface . Using the same ultrasound technology as the dive computers , it taps into the subaquatic network and relays its information up to a boat . People on that boat can then send and receive messages from divers below . That 's how Brodin was able to send his Facebook message from below the waves . His dive computer converted the text into an ultrasonic signal , and beamed it through the water to the surface . There , the buoy read the data and forwarded it to a laptop on the boat , which in turn sent it over a 4G network to the Internet . Facebook posts are n't the only thing that Aqwary 's dive computers will be able to get from the web . While battery life requirements mean that bandwidth is limited to about 2kbps ( way slower than 90s modem speeds ) , it 'll still be possible to transmit weather warnings , task updates or even small amounts of data on undersea life . `` I do n't think divers are as extreme as birdwatchers , but there are some that look out for specific types of fishes , '' says Brodin . `` We actually played around with the idea of making a Pokemon Go application ! It could probably be hacked together to some extent , but I 'm not sure Pokemon has [ an API ] you can use . '' To date , Aqwary 's app store has been locked down from third-party developers ( mainly as the device is classified as `` personal protective equipment '' ) . But that might change soon . `` We actually do have a HTML5 interface that we 're working on and eventually when it 's stable enough we 'll publish it for everyone to create their own apps , '' says Brodin . Ultimately , though , Brodin does n't want people sitting at the bottom of a lake reading Facebook . `` You 're only down for an hour - and most people dive less than an hour at a time , '' he says . `` Most things can wait except stuff that 's helping you enjoy your diving more when you 're there .

Facebook is closing in on 2 billion users but Mark Zuckerberg knows people are n't really using it like they once did - especially the younger generation . That 's part of the reason he now owns Instagram and WhatsApp too . Facebook 's latest attempt to create something not very much like Facebook is Lifestage , an iOS app you can install in the US if you 're aged 21 or below . Like Facebook was in its early days , it 's tied to your school or college . Video is front and centre , with those 'about me ' fields filled out with short Snapchat-style clips rather than boring old text . It 's not 2005 any more , gramps . You do n't need a Facebook account to sign up , reports TechCrunch , and you need to have 20 other users from your school create an account before it becomes an officially recognised place , letting you view your friends . The app was designed by coding whizzkid Michael Sayman who was personally invited to intern at Facebook by Zuckerberg himself . He says he wanted to reimagine what Facebook would look like if it launched in 2016 . Facebook has experimented with dozens of ways to stay fresh ( remember Slingshot ? ) and it 's big and rich enough to test apps such as Lifestage without necessarily launching them in full . Time will tell if this experiment makes it out into the wider world . How to take 360 photos and upload them to Facebook :

Facebook as a gaming platform just leveled up . The service that once hosted ephemeral favorites as Farmville , Candy Crush and Bejeweled will now host games like Firewatch , Gone Home and Ori and the Blind Forest thanks to a recent partnership with game engine maker Unity . The two struck a deal earlier today that will allow developers creating the next hit game on Unity to directly publish a version of the game to Facebook without working with the unwieldy Facebook API . So why does Facebook suddenly care about supplying you with games with actual stories ? Facebook intends to become its own gaming platform , similar to Steam but with more integrated social features , and the partnership with Unity is the first step towards getting there . It started back in May when Facebook launched a standalone app for gamers called Facebook Arcade that will soon transform from an App Store clone to a more mature , fully fleshed out service . And while the idea of more game notifications sound like something of a nightmare , it 's actually a win-win deal . Game makers will have access to 650 million potential new buyers and gamers will start seeing more traditional PC-style games pop up in their News Feed at some point in the near future . The deal is similar to Microsoft 's move to recently integrate the Xbox Store into Windows 10 , which gives better visibility to game developers – and , more importantly – extra money in Microsoft 's pocket . Unity is selecting a limited group of developers to receive immediate access to a closed-alpha build of the new export to Facebook functionality today and new developers will be on-boarded on an ongoing basis throughout the testing period .

Facebook is changing its News Feed once more , and this time it 's looking to make it more informative . The social network is adding a new `` ranking signal '' that will help surface the most informative stories that would 've already appeared in your Feed , just not in as prominent a view . Here 's how the algorithm works : Members of the company 's Feed Quality Program rank stories on a scale of one to five , one being `` really not informative '' and five being `` really informative . '' Participants who rank a story highly are also asked to explain why they enjoyed seeing that particular story . This data is then used to create a ranking signal , which is just one of the many signals used by Facebook to determine how relevant something is to you , based on your interests and habits . The results are , hopefully , posts that you find personally informative . This will likely change over time , Facebook notes in a blog post , and means you 'll see content in your News Feed that wo n't necessarily show up in the Feeds of people of you know . The Feed Quality Program is particularly intriguing for those who 've never heard about it before . It basically consists of `` tens of thousands '' of surveys crowd-sourced daily as well as more involved participants who are paid for their efforts . Together , they 'll determine what makes a story informative , though Facebook will rely on things like your own interests , relation to the whomever posted the story and what content you typically engage with to ultimately surface stories you see . The new ranking signal comes just a week after Facebook tweaked its News Feed to bury clickbait articles . Facebook updates its News Feed algorithm often , so this wo n't be the last time you hear about changes coming to what you see on the most popular social network on the planet .

Fresh from tackling rampant clickbait , Facebook is now setting sights on renovating ads on your News Feed - creating more helpful ads , but also circumventing your ad blocker . Announced today , Facebook 's new Ad Preferences menu grants you the control to choose only ads that are useful and relevant to you . For example , if your love of cats has resulted in fewer cute kitten videos and more more annoying advertisements for cat litter , you can drop it from your Preferences . You can also remove your name from customer lists that are no longer relevant to you , making room for sandwich specials at the local deli you 've been meaning to check out instead of constant reminders about Zumba Wednesdays at the gym you visited , like , once back when you were in college . This power comes at a cost , however . Ads on the desktop version of Facebook will still show up regardless of any ad-blocking software that may be in use . How that works was n't clarified , but Facebook claims it is not paying ad-blocking services to make exceptions - a common practice used by other major ad-supported companies . According to Facebook , the primary reason folks turn to ad blockers is `` to stop annoying , disruptive ads . '' In addition to Ad Preferences , the company is redesigning how ads are formatted on the site so it can cut down on the errant commercials in favor of ads you might actually use . While ad revenue is the lifeblood that allows free sites like Facebook to exist , offering control over what ads those users see - and ensuring those ads do n't overstep their boundaries - could be a helpful compromise for both parties .

There 's no love lost between the major mobile social networks , which seem to be 'borrowing ' features from each other : only a few days ago , Instagram launched a new Stories feature that 's remarkably similar to something already available in Snapchat . Now Facebook ( which owns Instagram ) is testing an instant selfie filter that lets you add layers and filters in real time - very Snapchat-esque , if you ask us . The feature is only live in Canada and Brazil for now , reports TechCrunch , and is tied in with the Olympics . You can , for example , stamp your face with virtual flags or sporting slogans that move with the lines of your face ( TechCrunch has a video of the feature in action ) . It looks like a lot of fun if you 're Brazilian or Canadian . If the users testing the instant camera like it , then Facebook says it may roll it out to everyone . Your Facebook app could soon be opening with a live camera preview , just like the Snapchat interface ( though of course Snapchat did n't invent the selfie either ) . According to Facebook the new feature is a response to the changing way that people use social media and social media apps : we 're not posting anywhere near as many text-only status updates as we used to , and Snapchat and Instagram are part of the reason why . Snapchat too has been expanding its capabilities , with better chat features , the option to load photos and videos from your phone rather than shoot them live , and of course the previously mentioned Stories feed . How to check if your PC is ready for virtual reality :

`` OMG ! What this celeb wore to the Oscars will make your jaw drop ! ! ! '' `` What this little girl says after her first trip to McDonald 's is absolutely priceless '' `` I ate this superfood for a week and you 'll be SHOCKED at the results ! '' Chances are , you see headlines like these in your Facebook News Feed on a daily basis . Deceptive clickbait articles have become somewhat synonymous with the social media experience , but it 's something Facebook plans to rectify , starting today . The social media giant announced it 's taking measures to cut out misleading or withholding headlines from your News Feed in order to encourage more genuine content on the service . `` People have told us they like seeing authentic stories the most , '' wrote Facebook in a blog post . `` That 's why we work hard to understand what type of stories and posts people consider genuine , so we can show more of them in News Feed . '' Facebook already took measures to slow down clickbait last year , and in June it began to focus on content created from users ' family and friends , rather than sponsored partners . The primary method of Facebook 's crusade against clickbait is identifying common phrases in the headlines that mislead , exaggerate , or manipulate expectations . ( See our examples above . ) Combing through thousands of articles to help identify these clickbait-y terms , the company built a system that compares those phrases with appropriate articles to judge their authenticity - something Facebook describes as `` similar to how many email spam filters work . '' A list of best practices is also provided for content producers to keep in mind when writing posts so that they avoid straying into clickbait territory . While Facebook warns that the distribution of pages with misleading articles will see a decrease , the company says responsible pages will not likely feel any major changes , which sounds like a win-win to them and users alike .

For the first time , a professional football match is set to be streamed through Facebook Live . The match , which is a friendly between Manchester United and Everton , will be available to watch on both Wayne Rooney 's and Manchester United 's Facebook pages . The move is a first for Facebook in what is fast becoming a trend amongst social media services . This year for the first time , YouTube showed this year 's Champions League and Europa League finals live and Twitter is planning more live sports streams with partners such as Major League Baseball , the National Football League and the National Hockey League . The profits generated from the broadcast of the game are set to go to four charities of Rooney 's choosing . We have contacted both Manchester United and Facebook to find out whether this is something either organisation is looking at doing more of in the future and will update this piece when we learn more .

Facebook is mimicking one of Snapchat 's most popular features , Snapchat Stories , in its Messenger chat app . The new feature , called Messenger Day , launched exclusively in Poland today . Snapchat Stories , for the unfamiliar , is a feature that lets users share photos , videos and drawings in a timeline that disappears after 24 hours . Messenger Day works almost exactly like Snapchat Stories , according to TechCrunch . Where Messenger Day differs from Snapchat Stories and , for that matter , Instagram Stories , is how it prompts users to use the feature . At the top of the chat list are options to quickly share how you 're feeling , what you 're doing and more . This makes it easier to share something quickly with all of your friends instead of managing a curated friends list . `` We know that people come to Messenger to share everyday moments with friends and family , '' said a Facebook spokesperson speaking with TechCrunch . `` In Poland we are running a small test of new ways for people to share those updates visually . '' It 's unclear whether Messenger Day will be available in other countries , though success in Poland may mean the feature could be released more widely . This is n't the first time Facebook has copied Snapchat . The social network 's photo sharing app , Instagram , aped Snapchat Stories by releasing Instagram Stories in August . According to TechCrunch , Facebook may have introduced Messenger Day to get users hooked on its Messenger app in hopes of preventing them from leaving to use Snapchat Stories . Facebook also has another chat app with 1 billion active users : WhatsApp . In order to keep people using its apps , Facebook has to bring popular features from competing platforms into its own . It 's also smart of Facebook to put a story feature in Messenger because its chat app is more intimate than its social network . By having Messenger Day inside a chat app , users do n't have to worry about sharing the highest quality photos or videos on their Facebook wall . Over the years , the social network has evolved into a place where users only share curated highlights about their lives instead of casually sharing thoughts and activities , something Snapchat excels at . Facebook Messenger currently has over 1 billion active users , compared to Snapchat 's 150 million . Using Messenger 's immense reach , Messenger Day could prove to be a popular feature .

Checking Facebook at the office could soon become part of your job , as the social media giant will reportedly branch out with its network for professionals next month . Succinctly called Facebook at Work , the network allows employees to connect , assign duties , and share information over the previously personal space . It 's expected out in just a few weeks , according to reports from The Information and TechCrunch . Facebook at Work functions in much the same way as competitors like Slack and Convo . While those services monetize with a subscription fee for data storage and group messaging between members , however , Facebook at Work is reportedly taking a slightly different approach . The planned model for Facebook 's take is said to scale prices to the size of the company rather than a flat rate . This should prevent scenarios where a team is paying for more space than necessary for their virtual meeting room . Given that most employees are likely already familiar with Facebook - and are probably keeping a tab open in anticipation of their lunch break already - Facebook at Work could find its place as an easy transition for companies looking for new workplace chat setups .

It may be hard to imagine a world without Facebook now , but the social network was only launched in 2004 . It took just over a year to surpass its biggest rival , MySpace , which dominated the scene , and by the end of its first 18 months online Facebook had attracted 100 million users . Many others would follow , including Twitter , LinkedIn , Pinterest , Tumblr , Google+ , and Instagram , yet Facebook remains the leader of the social network pack with more than 1.7 billion users at last count - nearly a quarter of the world 's population . Social networks , and particularly Facebook , can be a good way to stay in touch with friends and family , but there 's a growing body of evidence to suggest that they could be hazardous to your health . The need to keep up with your connections can lead to anxiety and broken sleep through compulsive social network checking . There 's a competitive angle , as people post an edited version of their lives that highlights the extremes - and social networking as a whole can encourage bullying online too . The social network phenomenon is obviously part of our increasingly sedentary lifestyles . But beyond the fact that you may be spending hours sitting or lying around squinting at a screen in your hand , the main health risks of social networks seem to relate to our mental health . `` The key risks psychologically are social anxiety and loneliness , which seem to increase with usage – the more people use these virtual systems , the more isolated they can become in real life , '' Professor of Psychology at Swansea University , Phil Reed , explained to us . `` In addition , depression can be linked to heavy use – in part due to loneliness , but also in part due to the social comparisons that people make with the unreal representations of the lives of others . '' FOMO ( fear of missing out ) is the biggest reason we compulsively check the service , and it 's a common enough term that it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013 . If you find yourself checking your phone when you 're already engaged in something that should be enjoyable , or picking Facebook friends over friends who are physically in the room with you , then you could be suffering from it . Research suggests that it can cause a wide variety of negative psychological consequences including pressure , paranoia , dissatisfaction , and jealousy . Reviewing an edited stream of other people 's lives can also influence our perception of our happiness relative to others . One study found that heavier Facebook users were more likely to agree that other people were happier and had better lives than them . You may also be getting a false impression of the world around you because of Facebook and something called the echo chamber effect . The idea is that you tend to befriend people with similar views to your own and posts are filtered through the collective bias . You may then get a nasty shock when events like elections do n't turn out as expected , as you 've been surrounded by people agreeing with your viewpoint - if you do n't know anyone who voted for the party or candidate you despise , then it ca n't happen , right ? You may even decide that you do n't need to vote . It 's not just Facebook that 's the cause of a lot of issues in society though - social networking as a whole has created a new suite of problems that previous generations never had to consider . If you 're indiscreet , then social networking posts can lead to lost opportunities . As many as 70 % of recruiters and HR professionals said they had rejected candidates based on information they found online , according to research commissioned by Microsoft . The rise of cyberbullying on social networks is also contributing to an increased likelihood of depression among teens . A recent global survey of 4,700 teenagers found that a fifth had experienced cyberbullying and nearly half of those asked described it as a bigger problem than drug abuse . There is a potentially positive side to Facebook and other social networks . It 's a good way to stay in touch , arrange events and share photos with friends and family . `` It can also be useful for professional purposes in terms of immediacy of contact and in terms of being able to access a wide range of skills in others – however , this is only a very small percentage of the usage of social media , '' says Prof. Reed . Social connections can also help combat loneliness and anxiety . People who struggle with face-to-face interactions or have few opportunities to meet like-minded friends in their local community can find companionship and conversation on social networks . `` Some people claim that it helps social contact , but , apart from some particular groups of individuals who find social contact face to face very difficult , there is little evidence of the benefits , '' suggests Prof. Reed . We 've looked at the issue of smartphone addiction before , but the smartphone is really just a delivery device for the internet and social networks . The problem is that it makes connecting much easier than it would be otherwise . We have our smartphones with us all the time , we 're conditioned to answer when they call , and for many people they 're the first thing we reach for in the morning and the last thing we do at night . More than one billion daily active users come through mobile devices , according to Facebook , and 56.5 % of all Facebook users only access the social network from their phones . `` The smartphone is set up to serve such platforms , allowing quick access in short bursts , '' says Prof. Reed , `` much different to the types of internet connection of ten or even five years ago . '' Social networks took off before smartphones and they would exist without them , but it 's fair to say that these mobile devices are exacerbating the problem by providing an immediacy that ca n't be found from a desktop computer . The first thing to do is consider whether you actually have a problem . You may be unaware of the impact that Facebook is having on your life and your mental wellbeing . If you use Facebook a lot , then you might want to check out the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale . `` Once we realize the scale of the problem , we can take measures to reduce our time on social networks , '' says Mrigaen Kapadia , developer of the BreakFree app for Android and iOS . `` We do n't need to quit , because social networks do have their advantages , but we should be conscious about our usage and not let it come in the way of being social . '' You can use these smartphone usage apps to see how often you are checking your phone and firing up Facebook . Measure how much time you 're actually spending on Facebook and if it 's too much , then try quitting it for a week and see how you feel . Post to tell people that you 're taking a break from it and wo n't be interacting for a while . Try replacing your Facebook time with something else that 's positive and can be done in similar small chunks of time , like learning a language with an app like Duolingo . At the end of the week you can assess whether you 've missed Facebook . How much has its absence impacted on your life ? Do you want to go back to using it as frequently ? The rise of social networks shows no signs of abating and the pressure to be a part of things like Facebook is tangible . For kids growing up today , opting out of social networks could be really damaging to their social lives . If everyone else is using it to chat and organise events , they may be left out . Plenty of people use Facebook without any apparent ill effects , but it 's easy to slide into overuse . The compulsion to use it grows as you get more active on it , so it 's important to be mindful of how often you 're checking in . `` There is little realization about the ill effects of social networking , and the big companies like Facebook and Google , are not going to take a stand against this , for obvious reasons , '' suggests Kapadia . `` The problem with social addiction is that there is no direct physical harm done , unlike smoking or drug addiction . This makes it very difficult to get the point across . '' It 's still early days for social networks like Facebook and there 's a lot we have n't figured out . `` Currently , it is very public . There are barely any norms , regulations or laws around it . This will change in the future , '' suggests Kapadia . `` I think it will be a lot more private than it is now . '' It would be foolish to think that this is it for social networking , that Facebook 's march to taking over the globe is going to continue in this vein . `` So if you go back 10 or 15 years , most of what we shared on the internet was text , right ? And , you know , over the last 5 or 10 years , now a lot of it is photos , '' explained Facebook CEO , Mark Zuckerberg , at a townhall meeting in Delhi . `` Over the next period of time , we 're really – I think – entering this golden age of internet video where the primary way we 're going to both share our experience and consume other people 's kind of experience and ideas online is going to be through video . `` But , you know , I do n't think videos are the end of the line , right ? Because , as rich as a video is in terms of telling a story it 's still just , you know , small screen . It 's still 2D . And I think that people want an even richer medium . `` You want to be able to feel like you 're there . And that 's what virtual reality and augmented reality can do . They can make it so that you actually feel like you 're right there in the scene . '' Of course , Facebook owns Oculus , one of the leading virtual reality headset manufacturers . We may well be headed for a future where we can plug into the virtual world together to spend time with friends and family or view events like concerts remotely . This could enable us to see places we 'd never otherwise see and spend time with people who are physically distant , but it will also come with its own set of potential problems . Whatever the future of social networking holds , Facebook aims to be a big part of it . The trick for us is not to overindulge . `` Like any behavior , if you enjoy it , then do it , but be aware of the risks , '' suggests Prof. Reed . `` Be aware of the reasons that you are using Facebook and remember that there are other ways to reach the same social ends , do n't let those fall by the wayside .

Facebook Messenger may be a one-stop shop for making plans with the besties , but even a leading chat app is n't exempt from group indecision and an even bigger social bane : reminding friends to pay you back . Thankfully , Messenger is adding just the features to combat these hurdles , allowing chatters to vote on choices in-app , as well as use the service 's built-in apps to make sure you do n't forget about your latest IOU . The new payment reminder feature taps into Facebook 's budding chatbot system . The machine learning algorithm catches phrases like `` I owe you X '' or `` please pay me X '' and offers a chance to pay immediately via services like Venmo , PayPal or Square . You 'll never have to leave Messenger , which is especially convenient for the more forgetful among us who still need to chip in on last night 's pizza . Messenger 's new polling powers work like it says on the tin - a user in the chat group can make up a list of options and ask the rest of the room for a vote . This is especially useful for those too-open-ended-for-their-own-good outings , where precious hours are lost deciding where to go or what to eat that night . The new features roll out today on iOS and Android in the US , and plan to expand globally if they are well-received . We do n't see that being too much of an issue , as we already owe the service some gratitude for helping us avoid faux pas similar to neglecting to pay someone back , like forgetting a friend 's birthday .

Facebook just scooped up a new company , one that could very well help it build products - including of the modular variety - at an unprecedented pace . Nascent Objects , described by Recode as a small startup that specializes in modular gadgets , developed what it claims is the `` world 's first modular consumer electronics platform . '' Read more : CEL-UK RoboxDual `` By combining hardware design , circuitry , 3D printing and modular electronics , our technology allows developers to go from concept to product in just weeks , much faster and less expensive than traditional methods , '' writes Nascent Objects CEO Baback Elmieh in a post announcing the company 's acquisition . The idea is to take the principles that govern creating software and apply those to building hardware . That means fast iteration , on-demand development and quick 180 turns , all of which are nearly impossible in the supply chain-driven world of tangible goods . `` People have become used to the idea that with software , you can have whatever you want , whenever you want it , '' says Elmieh . `` We want to make this happen with hardware - and we think Facebook is the best place to make this a reality . '' The Nascent Objects team will join Building 8 , Facebook 's hardware incubator . Led by ex-Googler Regina Dugan , Building 8 's mission is to develop hardware that advances the social media giant 's mission of connecting the world . `` Imagine designing , building and delivering a hardware product in just weeks . Instead of months , or even years , '' Dugan writes in welcoming Nascent Objects . `` Together , we hope to create hardware at a speed that 's more like software . '' What all this means specifically for Facebook remains to be seen , but the possibilities are endless . Could Building 8 use Nascent Objects ' expertise to develop a modular phone , something Dugan 's former stomping grounds tried to do ? It certainly seems plausible , and would fit Facebook 's ambitions of connecting people across the globe . Another possibility is drone development . Though Facebook is making strides in launching internet-delivering autonomous planes , it could potentially tap new , more efficient production systems to pump them out faster ( beating rivals like Google along the way ) . What 's equally likely is that Building 8 will develop products we have n't even seen yet , because now it 's armed with a way to turn concept into reality in the ( relative ) blink of an eye . We 'll see how this new buy shakes out , but it looks like Facebook just gained a distinct advantage over other hardware makers stuck with old modes of making things .

Soon you may be able to chat with strangers within your Facebook Messenger apps as it 's rumored the service will be opening public chat rooms in the near future . TechCrunch has found mentions of public chats within Messenger 's code , which includes a logo and a description of the service . The description reads , `` Rooms are for public conversations about topics and interests . Each room has a link that can be shared so anyone on Messenger can join the conversation . '' A number of TechCrunch readers found they were already able to launch chat rooms with both friends and strangers as well as a number of sharing features which are n't available in normal Messenger . It 's not the first time Facebook has experimented with chat rooms . In October 2014 , Facebook released its Rooms app for group messaging . Rooms was shut down last December . The reason was rumored to be the app was n't performing well enough . The service showcased the good and bad sides of open chat rooms - especially as you did n't need to sign up with your real name - but it was n't an app many wanted to download separately . Bringing this functionality into the Messenger app will make it a lot more accessible for the 900 million plus users of the platform . When asked to comment , Facebook told TechCrunch , `` We often run small tests - nothing more to share beyond that . '' Public chat rooms within Messenger may never happen though – we 'll have to wait for an official announcement from Facebook . In the meantime , there are always the chatbot applications .

Facebook Messenger has received another update , this time giving users the ability to make purchases without ever leaving the app . According to Facebook , since the Messenger platform launched 6 months ago , millions of people the world over have been engaging with businesses in `` new and exciting ways . '' In an effort to make it easier for brands and businesses to attract the attention of its users , Facebook has begun to make it possible for advertisers to open a Messenger conversation thread when `` Shop Now '' or `` Learn more '' buttons are clicked on News Feed ads . Before Facebook Messenger version 1.2 , users trying to make purchases from brand bots through the app would have to move to the browser or another app to complete their payment . Now , by storing their payment information on Facebook , users will be able to go through the purchase process from start to finish in a messenger thread , making the process of throwing your money at things you want smoother than ever . Check it out in action here . Facebook is also making it easier for users to share the bots they 've discovered by giving them them option to share direct links to open a bot conversation . In an official blogpost , Facebook revealed that businesses have built over 30,000 bots for Messenger and there are more than 34,000 developers working to increase this number so you 'll find plenty of chatbots to engage with and share . These new payment features are currently available to developers in a closed beta , but it 's expected that they 'll be rolled out more broadly later this year . Facebook is certainly well on its way to becoming a competitive e-commerce platform .

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket exploded in Cape Canaveral , Florida on Thursday at around 6:07am PT/9:07am ET/2:07pm GMT , destroying the rocket as well as the payload it was intended to carry to orbit . The blast was so strong , it reportedly shook buildings several miles away . The massive plumes of smoke were large enough to be picked up by weather radar . The rocket was due to launch Saturday to bring the AMOS-6 satellite into space , but it exploded during a routine rocket test . Known as a static fire test , this run-through is performed by restraining a rocket and turning on its engines . Think of it as a full dress rehearsal for launch . SpaceX initially thought the explosion was due to `` an anomaly on the [ launch ] pad '' but later clarified that a problem with the rocket 's oxygen tank was to blame . In this video , you can see the oxygen tank , which is located in the upper portion of the Falcon 9 , explode . The company is calling the event an anomaly , saying it `` originated around the upper stage oxygen tank and occurred during propellant loading of the vehicle . '' `` Per standard operating procedure , all personnel were clear of the pad and there were no injuries , '' the company 's statement , posted to Twitter , continued . The explosion is a blow to SpaceX , but its impact is n't just being felt by the company attempting to privatize space travel . Facebook and NASA also have a stake in SpaceX 's successes and failures , and Thursday 's explosion affected the social network especially . Facebook is working with SpaceX to send a satellite into space as part of the social network 's Internet.org initiative , which aims to bring connectivity to countries that do n't have widely adopted internet access . SpaceX was to provide the rocket to propel a satellite rented by Facebook into orbit this weekend . The AMOS-6 satellite is a communications probe for the Israeli satellite operator Spacecom , and Facebook leased bandwidth from French satellite company Eutalsat for Internet.org . This weekend 's launch would have been Facebook 's first internet-beaming satellite to make it to orbit . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , who is currently in Africa promoting the internet-delivery satellite , expressed disappointment about the Falcon 9 explosion , and the destruction of its cargo . `` I 'm deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX 's launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent , '' wrote Zuckerberg in a statement on his wall . `` We remain committed to our mission of connecting everyone , and we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided . '' Zuckerberg noted the social network has other internet-delivery means in the works , such as the Aquila plane , but the loss of the satellite is still significant . According to Globes , the AMOS-6 satellite reportedly cost around $ 200 million ( about £151m , AU $ 265m ) to build and $ 85 million ( about £64m , AU $ 113m ) to insure . In addition to financial impact , the explosion deals other blows as well . SpaceX , of course , is severely impacted by the rocket loss . Despite some success , the space exploration company has had a number of setbacks after another one of its Falcon 9 rockets exploded mid-flight in June 2015 . That explosion was also attributed to the rocket 's oxygen tank , which was ruptured by a failed support strut . SpaceX took a six month hiatus , but returned in December for a historic launch and landing of the Falcon 9 . It was the first time in history that a rocket landed upright back on Earth after going as deep into space as it had . The company then followed up with another successful landing in April of this year , this time on water . SpaceX has stayed mostly quiet about its upcoming plans after the explosion , only offering brief statements . `` Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation . Originated around upper stage oxygen tank , '' wrote SpaceX CEO Elon Musk in a tweet . SpaceX 's official site only reiterates what it posted on Twitter . Internet.org has faced its own setbacks in the past , namely for violating net neutrality . Its Free Basics internet service was banned in India in February of this year for `` discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content '' , according to the BBC . Facebook eventually pulled Free Basics from India altogether . The explosion is yet another hurdle for Facebook to overcome in its plan to connect the world via the internet , though it has other strategies . It 's currently testing its unmanned , solar-powered drone that will provide internet access to remote locations by circling an area for up to 90 days . However , the loss of an expensive satellite that would have furthered its ambitions is a blow to the company . SpaceX , meanwhile , currently still has plans to launch NASA astronauts to the International Space Station , though its planned late-2017 launch date may be delayed after Thursday 's news . The company also hopes to send the world 's first private spacecraft to Mars by 2018 , but the explosion also casts doubts . Coincidentally , an audit conducted by the NASA Inspector General 's office states the space program expects SpaceX 's commercial crew program to be delayed . This will force NASA to buy six additional seats on Russian rockets , which will cost US taxpayers $ 490 million ( about £370 million , AU $ 650 million ) .
Facebook Messenger is getting yet another feature today , now allowing you to share live video instantly with a friend . The new feature is called Instant Video and works , unsurprisingly , much like Snapchat 's own video messaging offering . Facebook Messenger does already have a video chat feature , but Instant Video aims to get users to share tidbits of their lives instead of having a full conversation . `` Instant Video is a reflection of the ubiquity of video — we simply expect to have that ability in real-time , all the time , '' writes Facebook in a blog post . `` With Instant Video , you can bring your conversations to life in the most authentic way — seamlessly and instantly . '' Facebook imagines Instant Video will be used in situations where you want to quickly get your friend 's opinion on a pair of shoes or need to ask a friend what ice cream flavor he or she would like . Short and sweet , and possibly actually helpful . To use Instant Video , you and a friend need to have your chat open in the Facebook Messenger app . Only then will the video button pulse , letting you know you can start an Instant Video . By default , videos show up in a window without sound , but can be enabled with a tap . Users can choose to enable their camera to show their reaction . Both Snapchat and Facebook Messenger support sending video notes as well if you do n't need an immediate response . Both services also support traditional video calling for longer conversations . Instant Video is just one of the many features Facebook hopes will keep its users from going to another chat app besides WhatsApp ( Facebook owns WhatsApp ) . Collectively , Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp have about 2 billion active users , showing Facebook 's dominance in the segment . For comparison , Snapchat has 150 million active users . Although Instant Video may not end up being a popular feature , it does n't have to be . Facebook just has to match its competitors and leverage the massive popularity of its social network to get users talking to one another .

Photos and video clips that disappear after 24 hours ; fancy filter overlays that add special effects or turn you and your friends into different characters ; one-to-one messages rather than a public news feed ... no , it 's not Snapchat , it 's Facebook 's new camera feature . Facebook is reportedly testing its new Snapchat-style camera features with a limited number of users before potentially rolling them out to the rest of us , reports TechCrunch , and it 's an unashamedly direct copy of what Snapchat already does . Facebook borrowing feature ideas from Snapchat is nothing new ( Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg tried to buy Snapchat in 2013 ) , but this update applies to the camera tool built right into the main Facebook app - it 's designed to make sharing `` fast , fun , and flexible '' according to camera product manager Sachin Monga . This is actually an adapted version of the feature Facebook tested during the 2016 Olympics in Rio . It sounds a lot more flexible and almost ready for the masses , and there are some arty Prisma-esque effects built into the camera too , apparently . It 's accessed with a quick swipe from the News Feed . After you 've created a photo or video you can post it to the News Feed or send it directly to some of your contacts , who then have 24 hours to watch it . Each message can be viewed once before it disappears , though just like Snapchat there is a limited replay option . Facebook bosses know they have a struggle on their hands to keep younger users interested - check your News Feed and see how many posts are by people under the age of 25 or so - and they 've obviously decided that following Snapchat 's lead is the way to go . There 's no word on when these new features will reach everyone , if they ever do , but watch this space . Header image : Josh Constine/TechCrunch

New photo editing apps like Prisma and Snapseed have changed the way we show off our photos on social media in 2016 , and Facebook now wants to change the way we upload videos too . Facebook ’ s Chief Product Officer Chris Cox showed off a prototype of similar filter technology to Prisma at an interview during the WSJD Live conference . Unlike Prisma , Facebook ’ s new tech is just designed for video and there 's no sign yet the company will allow it to work on still images . It ’ ll also work much faster than Prisma – apparently the demo on stage showed the video rendering in real-time , which Prisma does n't currently do . Cox admitted each filter is currently in a prototype stage and he did n't make it clear how Facebook plans to implement the technology . Facebook could release a new , separate app to compete with Prisma or it could bring the features to Instagram to offer extra video filters . There ’ s also the chance the company could implement this technology into its Facebook Live platform , which would make sense considering it works in real-time . For now we 're going to have to wait to find out as Cox did n't reveal when the technology will be launching . Via The Next Web

When it was just starting out , Facebook was no stranger to acquisition interests from larger companies . In a recent interview , former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer discussed Microsoft being one of these companies . In the interview with CNBC , Ballmer revealed that Microsoft had offered $ 24 billion for Facebook in 2007 when it was “ itsy bitsy . ” At this point the company was still a fair amount of time away from its initial public offering , which saw its value increase even more , but actually Microsoft was pretty late to the offer making game . According to David Kirkpatrick 's The Facebook Effect , Facebook started receiving offers from tech giants such as Google , Viacom , and Yahoo from as early as 2004 and many of them made offers more than once . A real precedent was set by Google when it made an offer to invest in Facebook at a $ 15 billion valuation . The offer was declined , after which Ballmer dropped in on behalf of Microsoft and reportedly asked “ why don ’ t we just buy you for $ 15 billion ? ” It 's not entirely unlikely that Ballmer 's offer was more of a reaction to Google 's obvious interest rather than stemming from a genuine belief that Microsoft and Facebook were the right fit for one another at the time . That said , the discussions must have gone on for a while and quite seriously if Ballmer did indeed eventually offer $ 24 billion as he says . As we all know , though , Zuckerberg declined . Ballmer said in his interview that he respected the decision . It ’ s certainly easy to respect a decision that was so clearly the correct one for Zuckerberg . Having become one of the biggest tech giants in the world , Facebook isn ’ t exactly `` itsy bitsy '' anymore with a market cap of $ 374 billion and Zuckerberg ’ s own net worth sitting at an estimated $ 57 billion . It 's hard to imagine a Facebook owned by Microsoft , though it would no doubt involve a lot more HoloLens and a lot less Oculus Rift .

Because Facebook knows we 're already addicted to our News Feeds , the social media juggernaut is rolling out new features designed to maximize our time on the service , plus maybe get out more . The latest upgrades to Facebook now let users poll their friends for recommended shops , find goings-on in their area , and even place orders or schedule appointments with local businesses without leaving the app . Using the new Recommendations feature , users can turn a regular post into a shout-out for suggestions from their friends , such as local salons that just opened , or must-try restaurants in a rarely visited part of town . Friends then chip in their two cents , while the Recommendations post keeps track of them on the map , allowing you to plan a full-on tour or a trip of convenience . Facebook is also revamping its Events system , rolling it into Recommendations for those polling the best way to spend their Saturday night . The new Events tab also makes it easier to see what all 's happening , based on your area , past events attended , and what all your friends are getting excited about . The expanded Events planner is expected to roll out in the coming weeks , starting with the US . Facebook 's dedicated app for hosting and finding eventswas just released , if you 're looking to get out of the house ASAP . Finally , business owners can now outfit their Pages with the ability to take orders , send quotes , schedule reservations , or buy tickets from inside the Facebook app . Ordering food is done by syncing the page with services like Delivery.com or Slice , while Fandango , Ticketmaster , and Eventbrite let users grab a seat for a night out through their local event space 's Facebook Page . These new Facebook features are available starting now , but are currently only available in the US . Facebook promises that even more productive features are in the works , and those should make an appearance in `` the coming months . ''

It 's perhaps the most hotly-anticipated game yet to be announced , but developer Rockstar has given perhaps its biggest tease yet that Red Dead Redemption 2 is on the way . On Sunday it updated its Facebook page with a very familiar red color scheme Cover Photo . That dappled red remind you of anything ? Take a look at the Red Dead Redemption box art : Awfully similar background , right ? The same image was tweeted , suggesting a co-ordinated teasing campaign for whatever comes next from Rockstar : pic.twitter.com/BklXMlZ0UQOctober 16 , 2016 The company 's Newswire website saw a similar update . Though Rockstar has n't offered any accompanying details with the social media updates , it seems to suggest that the open-world cowboy franchise will soon be making a return . Rockstar publishing partner Take-Two recently announced that the developer was `` of course hard at work on exciting future projects , '' and with the recent Grand Theft Auto V biker update seemingly marking the end of major content packs for that game , attentions are likely turning to the Old West . Indeed , earlier this year TechRadar exclusively revealed what a trusted source claimed to be a first look at the Red Dead Redemption 2 map , revealing the new game to be a prequel to 2010 's Red Dead Redemption . It also suggested that there will be a link to Mafia 3 , also published by Take-Two , with both Mafia 3 and the Red Dead leak sharing the location of New Bordeaux . Not counting the PS4 , Xbox One and PC remakes of GTA V , Rockstar has n't revealed an all new game since 2011 , when it first showed off Grand Theft Auto V for the PS3 and Xbox 360 . 2010 's Red Dead Redemption is often considered one of the finest games of the last generation , mixing the open-world action of the Grand Theft Auto series with a super-cool spaghetti western aesthetic . A current gen return to the Wild West created by Rockstar is high on many a gamer 's wishlist .

Update : You can now watch back the world 's first ever Facebook Live murder mystery , but you wo n't be able to take part anymore . Scroll down below for the video feed . Ever fancied yourself as a real-life Poriot or Columbo ? A new Facebook Live event may be the perfect opportunity to try your hand at solving mysteries without having to get up off the sofa . We went along to preview the first ever Facebook Live murder mystery , called Framed . It ’ s a spin on traditional murder mystery events , where you play a detective and try to solve a fictional crime through a series of clues to find out who killed the victim . But this time , it ’ ll take crowd-sourced teamwork to crack the case . And we didn ’ t do particularly well . In the 10-minute preview – which was the opening scene for tonight ’ s experience – we got caught by the police after only taking a few steps toward solving the murder . The story begins with a security guard locked in an art exhibit with a dead body , the murder weapon and a series of clues to kick things off . Soon the police are on their way – but they will take about an hour to get to the scene , and the main character will fail if the crime isn ’ t solved before they arrive . The audience will have to work out exactly how to solve the murder in the allotted time , and that ’ s where Facebook Live and you come in . You ’ ll be able to vote and leave comments on the Facebook Live stream to tell the main character what he should do to solve the case . Sam Pearson , producer at UKTV , told TechRadar : “ One of the great things about Facebook Live is it gives us the interactivity through comments and reactions to allow the Alibi audience to be in the murder mystery . ” As it ’ s the internet , the team behind the project are aware there will likely be some offensive remarks in the comments feed . The team assured us a moderator will be on hand to bring some of the best comments to appear on the screen and be used as instructions , but most of it will be done through voting . Two options will appear on the screen . For example , “ root through the bin ” or “ don ’ t look in the bin ” – the audience will then press the reaction button “ Haha ” for the former or “ Wow ” for the latter . Pearson said , “ That ’ s a way for us to cut through the noise a bit more and steer people down the right directions as well to make sure they don ’ t go too off-piste . “ We also don ’ t know which way those votes are going to go . ” This is the first time an experiment on Facebook Live has been undertaken , but it ’ s not the first murder mystery UKTV has tried to create over social media . Twurder was a previous project made by the network where audio , visual and written clues were revealed on Twitter . Followers then tried to work out the culprit , but Facebook allows for a live video feed instead . Taking place on Alibi ’ s Facebook feed – which has 45,000 fans already – the network hopes a buzz will see it grow to far more viewers than just its fans . “ With Facebook ’ s organic way of including those commenting we should be looking at much more than 45,000 , '' adds Pearson . `` Fingers crossed . ” Although the production is only for social media and won ’ t be transmitted on TV , the crew is similar to a TV show shoot with audio experts , actors , lighting and many more involved in the project . Alibi may also look to show this content on TV in the future if it proves a success . Yolaine Campana , Assistant Producer at Social Life – which is collaborating on the project with UKTV – said : “ It allows us to have more creativity and reimagine program content through a different format – that ’ s social media . ” If this proves to be a success you may one day see similar interactive events taking place on Dave , Gold , Eden or other UKTV channels . But Framed ’ s success will rely on how many tune in and interact for the full hour . Pearson said : “ I ’ ve got faith in the public to solve it . But ultimately there ’ s a little bit of volition with the main character . “ With the voting as well , we ’ ll also be leading people down a certain track . ” You can take part tonight ( October 13 ) on the Alibi Facebook page at 8PM BST ( 3PM EST , 12PM EST , 6AM ACT ) to try your hand at solving the crime . But there ’ s a lot that can still go wrong . Bad internet connections , live mistakes from the crew , small viewer numbers and a lack of interaction on the page could still cause issues on the night . Whether the internet comes together to collaborate and make a hive mind version of Columbo is yet to be seen .

Half the fun of Facebook is seeing what out-there videos were shared on your News Feed , but the confines of a smartphone screen can sometimes hold things back . To help improve the 'Hey , check this out ! ' factor of browsing Facebook , the social media service just added the ability to take videos from your feed and blow them up on a television . The feature lets Facebook users stream videos to a TV outfitted with Apple TV or Chromecast ( or any other AirPlay or Google Cast-enabled display ) with a single press of a button in the top-right corner of their video . While everything plays out , users can still browse their News Feed - allowing them to find even more videos to cast , should the initial batch of 15-second recipe guides run dry . Not only will browsing videos on the bigger screen save your buddies from having to crowd around a smaller one to see the latest cat video or Last Week Tonight blurb , but users can also see live reactions as it airs . Facebook currently has its video-casting feature rolling out for iOS and the web , with Android support for Chromecast coming soon .
Tt eSports ( a division of Thermaltake ) has announced a new gaming mouse with a novel addition – a fingerprint sensor built into the side of the peripheral . The Black FP mouse sports the integrated sensor at the front of the left-hand side of the device , where the thumb of a right-handed person would naturally rest , as you can see in the image above . Once you ’ ve run through the software setup , you ’ ll be able to use your fingerprint for secure biometric , no-hassle logins into Windows , websites , or indeed protected folders on your desktop . The fingerprint reader is made by Synaptics and Tt eSports notes that it ’ s a snappy little piece of hardware , taking only a fifth of a second to read your fingerprint and then verify it . The sensor is FIDO compliant and boasts 256-bit AES encryption to ensure the security of your data . While there are no overt gaming applications for it right now , the sensor is a solid little extra which will come in handy – and who knows what we ’ ll see in the pipeline for the future . So what about the rest of the mouse , fingerprint shenanigans aside ? The Black FP runs with an Avago 9500 sensor which gives you up to 5,700 dpi in terms of sensitivity , which can be adjusted in increments of 100 dpi – with four programmable dpi profiles which you can switch between on-the-fly . There are seven buttons on board which are also programmable with various macros , and the main mouse buttons use Omron switches which have a five million click lifespan . You also get some funky red LED lights positioned strategically around the device , including a bank of four to indicate which dpi profile you ’ re using . So what ’ s the asking price for this rodent and its biometric bonus ? It ’ ll cost you $ 60 ( around £50 , AU $ 80 ) . Via : Hexus

Facebook has announced that senior VP of Maxis and executive producer of The Sims 4 , Rachel Rubin Franklin , is now the new head of its Social VR team . Recently at the Oculus Connect conference , Mark Zuckerberg demoed how Facebook plans to make virtual reality ( VR ) a much more social experience for friends and family that ca n't always be in the same room . Franklin will now be helping to lead the team that ’ s trying to bring that demo to life . According to Facebook , Franklin will work with other members of its Social VR leadership team , including Michael Booth and Lucy Bradshaw who were virtually present with Zuckerberg at the Oculus Connect demo . Facebook ’ s CTO Mike Schroepfer expressed his excitement about Franklin joining the team , stating in a post that “ It is a blast to fuse the experience of people who have developed many successful immersive online worlds with engineers who have decades of collective experience building Facebook . ” Franklin and the Social VR team don ’ t have an easy task ahead of them – it ’ s hard to sell the external view of virtual reality as a social experience . When all they 're able to see is the eye-blocking headset and sound-muffling headphones , it 's unsurprising many people view it as the most perfectly isolated experience possible . But Facebook doesn ’ t do isolation . Zuckerberg demonstrated that his vision for Oculus and Facebook involves creating Social VR experiences that will enable us to interact across long distances through avatars in virtual environments . The demo shown onstage included interesting features such as taking a Messenger call whilst wearing the VR headset , as well as playing games with other avatars , and changing your avatar ’ s facial expression using the VR emoji gesture feature . To keep things inclusive , a VR headset is not a requirement to take part in these experiences . Franklin ’ s team will be faced with the challenge of making these social features feel natural to use and presenting them as a viable , even preferable , alternative to just talking with your friends on Chat or through a Messenger video call . Having been so deeply involved in the development of The Sims , Franklin will no doubt be well-equipped to help develop avatars that look and behave like real people without venturing down the disturbing and off-putting uncanny valley – a key factor in developing a VR world that people feel comfortable being in . Through its Oculus Connect demo and its commitment to putting together a strong team , Facebook is showing that it ’ s making real strides in producing creative , viable social VR experiences . If it manages to get it right , it could be huge in helping VR become a ubiquitous piece of technology rather than remaining restricted as a fun but inessential gaming or film platform .

For 12 years Facebook has been part of our personal lives , coming with us to parties , on holidays , helping us keep in touch and keep tabs , but we ’ ve always made an effort to keep it separate from our professional lives . Now , though , Facebook is putting on its suit and insisting on joining us in the office with the launch of its new professional communication tool , Workplace . Conceived , built , and now launched in Facebook ’ s London offices , Workplace is a tool that will allow colleagues to send one another group and private messages in order to collaborate and share information on work projects . Facebook has been developing the platform for over two years , and it entered its closed beta phase last year with some big names like the Royal Bank of Scotland and Danone signing up to test it out . It ’ ll be important that Facebook continues to attract the attention of big corporate bodies like this since it ’ s entering a very competitive space that includes enterprise communication giants such as Slack and Microsoft ’ s Yammer . These platforms already have loyal and large user bases and it might prove challenging for Facebook to draw them away . However , Workplace does have a distinct advantage over these other platforms in that its user interface is based on one over a quarter of the world is already familiar with – Facebook . Like ordinary Facebook , Workplace is available on the web and in a mobile app , though Facebook does say that Workplace is more of a mobile-first platform for constantly fast and easy access . As you 'd expect , there ’ s a News Feed keeping you up-to-date with business and colleague activity . There ’ s also the ability to chat in groups and privately , as well as share documents and videos within these chats . Facebook Live , a relatively recent addition to ordinary Facebook , is also a feature on Workplace , something its developers think could facilitate things like live Q & A sessions with company CEOs , which would greatly open up communication and increase transparency within a company . Opening up company structures is a goal Facebook is really pushing with workplace , with head of EMEA Nicola Mendelsohn saying the point of the platform is to encourage ‘ fast ’ ‘ open ' and ‘ frictionless interaction ’ across all levels . For businesses struggling to engage all of their employees in their in-house chat programs , the familiarity and relative ease-of-use offered by Workplace could prove to be incredibly attractive , and will almost certainly boost adoption of the service . Even for employees that aren ’ t users of Facebook , a personal account is not a requirement to set up a corporate account , nor is an email address . Those that do have a personal Facebook account will be comforted to know that their employer will have absolutely no access to what ’ s posted on there as the accounts remain completely separate . Though their user interfaces and functionalities are similar , much like your personal self and world self , there are differences between Facebook and Workplace which include a more sober dark gray color scheme and a lack of ads . It will also include features that are specifically useful for businesses , such as multi-company groups . Knowing that ‘ no company is an island , ' Facebook has introduced this feature in order to allow companies to interact with other partner companies as well as communicate internally . Clearly Facebook is on the right track with its platform . Workplace might have just launched but it already has 1,000 companies signed up and it 's proving particularly popular in India , Norway , the US , the UK , and France . As Workplace doesn ’ t feature ads , for the first time Facebook will be charging for one of its services . How much a company pays for Workplace depends entirely on how many people it has using it ; the more people in your company using the service , the less your company will pay per individual user . For up to 1,000 active monthly users it will cost $ 3 per user per month , for 1,001 to 10,000 users it will cost $ 2 per user month , and for over 10,001 active users it 's only $ 1 per user per month . To keep the service as accessible as possible , Facebook has said nonprofit and educational organizations will be able to access the service for free . Workplace is open for business from now , with businesses able to express interest through the Workplace site .

Facebook has a history of separating specific features from its mobile app to make stand-alone apps . Users may remember the consternation they felt when social network first removed Messenger from the main Facebook app . Then it created a Groups app and today , it 's releasing a brand-new Events app . Facebook says more than 100 million people use Facebook events every day . By creating a new app specifically around events , Facebook hopes it 'll be easier for users to find local happenings and to keep track of invites from friends . There 's even an interactive map for visually browsing what 's going on around you . But Facebook Events is n't just a place to discover things to do . It also serves as a calendar application , continuing Facebook 's strategy of embedding itself into every aspect of your life . You can even import events from Google Calendar and iCloud to make Events the default calendar app on your phone . So why does Facebook keep separating its features into separate apps ? The biggest reason is simple : money . With Facebook Messenger , the company introduced chatbots to curate news and send friends money . Just a couple of days ago , Facebook announced that you 'll be able to shop for and buy things from the Shopify bot . With Events , it 's easy to imagine Facebook eventually selling users tickets to concerts and other events nearby , though the app does n't currently do that . If you 're ready to live in Facebook 's brave new world , you can download the Events app for iPhone from the App Store . Android users will have to wait , but Facebook says the Android app is `` coming soon . ''
Virtual reality may seem like the ultimate isolation experience , but according to Facebook and Oculus , it does n't have to be that way . In fact , it can be the quite opposite . `` Virtual reality is the perfect platform to put people first , '' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the Oculus Connect 3 conference today . Not every VR experience will be social , he noted , but for those looking to connect with friends and family , you 'll have plenty of ways to do so while you 're strapped inside a headset . To this end , Facebook and Oculus demonstrated and announced a number of `` social VR '' features on stage . These ranged from still-incubating experiments to features headed to the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR soon . All showed just how central social interaction is to the firms ' plans for virtual reality . Zuckerberg donned a Rift headset and grabbed hold of Touch controllers to walk through several experiences Facebook is currently tinkering with . Many were shown off in a more basic form at this year 's F8 , but it was plain to see these experiments are progressing nicely . Styled as an avatar that resembled a `` young Justin Timberlake , '' Zuckerberg joined up with two other avatars , and together they jumped into a few exotic locations , including the ocean floor and Mars ( see , it wo n't take billions of dollars to get there , one of the avatars quipped ) . Ever the CEO , Zuckerberg ultimately decided to visit his office at Facebook HQ , where the avatars played a quick game of cards . The trio also conjured a movie screen so they could watch a short clip together . Zuckerberg also wanted to check in on his dog at home , so the avatars - and by extension , the thousands of people watching - were transported to his abode . We could see his dog , Beast , was doing fine . An incoming call was answered within the VR world - Zuckerberg 's wife , Priscilla Chan , popped up live via video feed . She was not wearing a headset , so this served to illustrate that even in VR , you can interact with people on the outside . Likely because he 's the founder of the largest social network on the planet , Zuckerberg grabbed a virtual selfie stick to take a `` modern day family portrait '' to post to Facebook . Though not a feature for Rift or Gear VR yet , the company seems keen to allow people to post snaps and videos straight from their VR headset to Facebook . We would n't be surprised if the firm is working on Instagram posting , too . While these are still just `` explorations '' , Zuckerberg 's walk-through showed Facebook is actively working to integrate social elements into virtual reality , allowing users to connect and engage within VR as well as with people who are n't wearing headsets . We would n't be surprised if the next time Zuck shows these demos off , the features are even closer to actualization . If Facebook was the `` here 's what you will be able to do , '' Oculus was the `` here 's what you can do now '' during the OC3 keynote . The Rift makers introduced a few new features designed to make their VR experience a bit more personal as well as help users connect with friends . First up , Oculus Avatars , or customizable VR identities users create for themselves . There are over 1 billion Avatar permutations possible , Oculus said , so users can make an avatar that 's unique and self-expressive . The Avatars are far more detailed than the grid-patterned block heads you see in Rift right now , so users may appreciate being able to craft their own VR persona . Avatars are headed to Rift when the Touch controllers launch on December 6 , and come to mobile in early 2017 . To further foster socializing , Oculus also introduced Parties and Rooms . Parties let users set up a voice call with up to eight people , who can be anywhere in VR . Rooms , on the other hand , let you actually `` meet up '' with friends . You can do things like play a game , watch a movie or simply hang out inside a Room . Parties and Rooms head to Gear VR `` in the coming weeks , '' Oculus said . Facebook and Oculus are placing a huge focus on social interaction , standing firm in the conviction that VR has applications beyond gaming and can help people connect , especially if they are physically apart . The features shown off today are strong strides in achieving social VR - now it 's up to users to embrace it .

Shopify , which helps small businesses hit the web with an attractive site and easy-to-navigate digital storefront , is taking things to the next level by allowing shops to sell directly through a new platform : Facebook Messenger . Though the service has had the ability to chat with customers via Messenger before , Shopify 's new venture allows retailers to have their wares explored , detailed , and purchased entirely within Facebook 's messaging app . This is n't the first time users have been able to use Messenger for monetary transactions . The app 's chatbot functionality uses services like Venmo , Paypal , and Square so users can send each other money without leaving the app , and can even tell when you owe a buddy for something . However , Shopify 's new functionality is special in that it brings a fully-functional store to the app . Even similar Messenger add-ons like Spring , which finds for-sale fashion selections based on the user 's taste , still require leaving the chat room to finalize purchases or talk with a representative . The news also comes just a couple days after Facebook released its Marketplace platform for its main site , opening up the ability to buy and sell directly through the site to all of its users . That said , the service is designed more for personal yard sale-style transactions than day-to-day business , like Shopify 's Mesenger integration does .

Facebook just finished upgrading Messenger with one of the biggest features to ever come to the app - fully encrypted messaging between devices . Called `` Secret Conversations , '' Messenger 's encryption feature has been quietly rolling out on iOS and Android devices , with Wired reporting that the process has just now been completed . That means nearly 900 million users are now covered with totally secure messaging , provided they all have the latest version of the app . In addition to encrypting missives sent between devices , Secret Conversations can also put Mission : Impossible-style self-destruct timers on messages , ensuring that particularly sensitive material ( Netflix passwords , anyone ? ) are deleted forever after as long as a day to even just 5 seconds after being opened . There are a few limitations that come with Secret Conversations , however . Initiating the feature disables .gifs , videos , voice messages , voice calling , and mobile payments . What 's more , it only works one-on-one , ruling out incognito group chats for the time being . While encryption is certainly a welcome feature on Messenger , it 's not a particularly visible one . To activate Secret Conversations , one must start a new message thread and press the discreetly placed `` Secret '' button on the top-right of the screen when choosing a recipient . As of writing , there is no way to start Secret Conversations as a default , or convert an existing chat with a friend into an encrypted one . Encryption , which can prevent unwanted eyes from snooping in on your messages - be it criminals , companies , or even intelligence agencies - has become a new trend for messaging services in the past year . Chat-app bigwig WhatsApp made some of the biggest pushes for privacy this past spring , when the app completely encrypted any and all messages sent by its over 1 billion users . Google 's recently released competitor , Allo , also offers an Incognito Mode to encrypt messages , though it must be turned on manually , like Secret Conversations . While it 's not very self-serving to hide Secret Conversations off in a corner , we appreciate Messenger striking a balance between privacy over chatbots and allowing users to send messages to their friends that even Facebook ca n't peep in on .

Got some old furniture clogging up the loft ? A cellar full of old CDs and `` vintage '' clothing ? The usual route for these items would be either a trip to the local charity stop , or an eBay listing . But Facebook is now making a play for your used goods with its new Marketplace feature . Building on the success of its Groups function , many of which already facilitate local trade between Facebook users , Marketplace is a new way for the social network 's users to `` discover , buy and sell items '' . With its own dedicated part of the Facebook app , you 'll be able to post photos of your items for sale , descriptions and prices , as well as listing your items under a category along with your location . Anyone searching for an item will see the details , as well as a photo of the person listing the item . From there on in , finishing the deal is completely down to the seller and the buyer - you 'll be able to discuss a deal and arrange a meet up via messages , without Facebook getting involved . It explicitly states that it `` does not facilitate the payment or delivery of items in Marketplace . '' In other words , as it 's not handling any money , Facebook is n't taking a cut of any sale , nor do you have to pay the social network a middle-man listing fee . It 's a distinct advantage over eBay 's listing fees , while offering the local attraction of the likes of Craigslist along with the added networked benefits of Facebook . Although it does n't handle payments directly , Facebook recently added payment functionality into its Messenger app in the US , which adds another level of convenience when making payments . The feature will be rolling out to both Android and iPhone users in the US , UK , Australia and New Zealand over the next few days , provided they 're aged over 18 .
Facebook has announced the launch of Messenger Lite , a `` slimmed down '' and stripped back version of its Messenger app for Android handsets . In a blog post on its site , Facebook says Messenger Lite has been created `` to empower people all over the world to stay connected . '' The streamlined app offers all of the core functions of the main Messenger app , allowing users to send messages , photos , links , and stickers to anyone else using Messenger . It 's not clear just yet what features Messenger Lite users will be missing out on , but by stripping back Messenger to these basic functions Facebook is able to keep the app under 10MB . Keeping the app small makes it `` fast to install and quick to start up '' as well as less prone to excessive data consumption . Much like the Facebook Lite app which was released last year , the idea behind this is that it 's ideal for users in emerging markets where there 's a prevalence of more basic Android handsets and slower internet connections . Tom Mulcahy , Engineering Manager for Messenger Lite , said that thanks to Messenger Lite `` more people can stay in contact , regardless of network conditions or storage limitations on their Android devices , '' adding that `` Messenger Lite was built to give people a great Messenger experience , no matter what technology they use or have access to . '' Earlier this year , Facebook announced that Messenger has more than 1 billion active users worldwide . Clearly , though , the social network is determined to continue its push to get developing countries online , and more specifically on to Facebook . At the moment , Messenger Lite is only rolling out to users in Kenya , Tunisia , Malaysia , Sri Lanka and Venezuela , but it will expand into other countries in the coming months .

The government 's war on porn might also encompass social media if ministers have their way . Tory MP John Whittingdale has suggested that while the proposed `` porn block '' takes care of the wider internet , the problem of adult content on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram continues to be an issue . Whittingdale told parliament that social media is `` one of the main ways in which young people are now exposed to pornography '' . The Digital Economy Bill , which is being debated by MPs , proposes that adult sites are required to verify the age of anyone using them . It will require that any site , either in the UK or elsewhere , use a more robust system to ensure that users are old enough to view that content . Twitter does n't restrict the use of porn on its service , although it does prohibit it in profile images . Facebook and Instagram take a much harder line on the content , restricting everything from porn through to more legitimate images . Facebook in particular bans even breastfeeding photos if they contain a nipple , in spite of nearly every human being fitted with them as standard . The government has said that the British Board of Film Classification will manage the age restriction day-to-day . However the bill targets only companies that make money from the hosting of porn through subscriptions or advertising . But digital minister Matt Hancock says that most children are exposed to porn by accident initially . Twitter could employ more stringent geographical blocking on content . The company , for example , blocks any content that supports Nazi ideologies in Germany , where such content is illegal . It could , therefore , adopt more strict rules in the UK if needed . However tools like VPNs , or even setting your home country as something other than the UK would potentially allow users to skirt such a block . It 's quite clear that the Digital Economy Bill has some serious work before it can hope to restrict the access to adult content . Even blocking porn on the web and on social media would still do little to prevent under-18s from being sent videos or photos via other messaging services .

Ever fancied yourself as a future Employee of the Month at Facebook ? Then here 's your chance - the social networking giant has announced plans for a huge expansion of its UK offices . Zuckerberg 's crew is set to add 500 new roles to its UK operations , expanding the company 's presence in the UK by 50 per cent as it opens brand new headquarters in London 's Fitzrovia area . `` The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company , '' said Nicola Mendelsohn , vice-president for Europe , the Middle East and Africa at Facebook . `` Many of those new roles will be high-skilled engineering jobs as the UK is home to our largest engineering base outside of the US . '' It 's not just about engineering roles though . Project managers , marketing teams and sales staff will all also be scouted by Facebook . Facebook follows in the footsteps of Google , which has also given a vote of confidence in post-Brexit Britain with a £1bn investment in a new London HQ and the introduction of 3,000 jobs by 2020 . `` Facebook 's decision to expand in London is further evidence that London 's strength as a tech hub keeps on growing , '' said London Mayor Sadiq Khan . `` The capital 's vibrant tech scene is the envy of Europe and Facebook 's continuing commitment is another sign that London is open to talent , innovation and entrepreneurship from all four corners of the world . '' It might be time to give your CV resume that well-overdue spruce up , then .
Although Facebook attempts to improve its Android app with every update , a recent independent test performed by Tech World Zone ( TWZ ) has revealed that the app has a tendency to suck up an inordinate amount of battery life on Android devices . Facebook has known about this issue for a while and the company ’ s central item officer , Chris Cox , even instructed his staff to drop their iPhones for Android devices in an attempt to help uncover and solve the problem . It ’ s an interesting move , but it doesn ’ t appear to have worked . Earlier this year , Android blogger Russell Holly ’ s findings showed that Android battery life and performance improved without the Facebook app , and a group of people on Reddit supported his claims after performing tests of their own . These Redditors found that without the Facebook and Messenger apps , other apps on their smartphones launched faster and performed better . Seeing this , TWZ has decided to explore other means of accessing Facebook outside of its app to see if this would improve smartphone battery life . By swapping the Facebook app for Metal , a wrapper for Facebook ’ s mobile site , the tester found that their Huawei Nexus 6P battery life was 20 % better off over the course of a day . It also proved to be the case over a whole week . Using Android ’ s built-in battery statistics , the tester didn ’ t find that Facebook was using a large amount of power , but said it was evidently using more power in the background than it had to as it was having an effect on the battery utilization of various Android administrations . When contacted by TWZ about the issue , Facebook replied saying “ We have heard reports of a few people encountering speed issues coming from our Android application . We are investigating this and will update you as often as possible . We are focused on keeping on enhancing these issues. ” They had no comment , however , on the battery life issues . Of course , the test performed by TWZ is only on one smartphone so if you want to see whether getting rid of the Facebook app on your Android device could actually improve its performance , the best thing to do is try deleting it for yourself . There are a few replacement apps out there such as Metal , but you can also just access Facebook through Chrome . It ’ s not quite as convenient , but if it improves your smartphone 's performance and battery life it could be worth it . Besides , you might find yourself mindlessly clicking into the Facebook app less - and there ’ s something to be said about not being bombarded with notification symbols as soon as you unlock your phone .

The issue of how much responsibility Facebook should take for the news and stories shared on its platform has been rumbling along all year , but there 's been a renewed focus on less-than-accurate reporting in the wake of Donald Trump 's US election victory . Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has previously said that his site is n't in the business of making news and simply reflects what its users are talking about , but on Friday he did outline some of the steps Facebook is going to take to stop fake news from spreading . You can read the whole update for yourself , but Zuck is promising better technical solutions to spot inaccurate stories , easier ways for users to report fake news , and more prominent warning next to suspicious content . `` We take misinformation seriously , '' writes Zuckerberg . `` We 've been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously . We 've made significant progress , but there is more work to be done . '' `` We believe in giving people a voice , which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible , '' he adds . `` We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or mistakenly restricting accurate content . '' Zuckerberg closes out his post by reiterating Facebook 's commitment to listening to its users and those in the journalism industry to make improvements in the future . We 'll have to wait and see whether it 's enough to better weed out the untruths from your News Feed .

Facebook has had a bright idea in terms of helping businesses keep on top of managing their social media – and better responding to customers – with the introduction of a unified inbox for Facebook , Messenger and Instagram . Rather than trying to juggle comments and responses across these three channels separately , with the new Pages Manager inbox , the social media manager ( or team ) at a company will have access to them all within this single app . That means if you fire a complaint across on Instagram , it ’ ll just as likely be seen as a message posted on Facebook ( as opposed to being more likely to be missed when posted on the ‘ lesser ’ channel ) . Thus we can hope for prompter responses , whichever medium is used to message a company , and hopefully less cases where comments fall by the wayside and could end up ignored . Facebook also noted that the app provides an easy way to glance at basic info about the folks who interact with a business – it ’ s just a case of tapping their name to see their public profile and previous interactions with the organisation . Nicole Chase , admin of Nicssential Oils Silver , told Facebook : `` The new and improved inbox gives me a quick snapshot of all media channels in an organised and succinct way . It cuts down the time I spend on administrative tasks by around 12 % , and it allows me to provide a more detailed and personalised service . '' The new inbox is being rolled out to users of the Pages Manager app ( on iOS and Android ) over the ‘ coming weeks ’ according to Facebook , so businesses haven ’ t got long to wait – and neither have customers who will hopefully feel the benefit as mentioned . In other recent changes , Facebook is also rolling out the ability to join public chat rooms in Messenger . Currently this feature is only available in Australia and Canada , but it ’ s likely to spread elsewhere soon enough . Via : Engadget

Facebook is continuing on its quest to make Messenger as feature-packed and comprehensive as it possibly can , and the latest addition to the versatile messaging app is an option to join public chat rooms , something we saw in leaked code last month . The feature 's called Rooms , and if that sounds familiar it 's because Facebook tested a separate app with that name a couple of years ago . While the app did n't last , some of its functionality will now be available in Messenger itself . Messenger already supports group chats but this is more for wider conversations that anyone can join in with , according to Facebook , without having to be already connected on the social network . However , Rooms can be made private if required , with approval required to join . Right now Rooms is only available in Australia and Canada , but with Facebook acknowledging the new feature publicly , there 's a good chance the rest of us will get it somewhere down the line . `` This will be for topic-based conversations and so people can talk with others they may not know , '' Facebook product manager Drew Moxon told The Courier Mail . Think your favourite sports team , or ( if you dare ) politics . Bulletin boards and public chat rooms helped form the online communities that the early web was built on , so in some ways it 's already a tried and trusted way of communicating - but this time locked into Facebook 's app on your mobile .

Do n't panic if you 've logged into Facebook this weekend only to be told you 've passed away - it 's the fault of a rather embarrassing bug that the social network has now fixed . Somehow a switch got flicked that marked a large number of profiles as `` memorialised '' , which is one of the options you can pick from for your profile after you 've shuffled off this mortal coil . Even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was affected by the glitch . `` This was a terrible error that we have now fixed , '' said a Facebook spokesperson . `` We are very sorry that this happened . '' Judging from the reactions on social media , most users took the temporary bug in good spirits , rather than suddenly being hit with a sense of creeping existential dread that everything had gone a bit Sixth Sense . Delve into Facebook 's settings and you can specify a `` legacy contact '' who manages your profile after you 've kicked the bucket . Alternatively you can tell Facebook to delete your page instead once you 're no longer in the land of the living . Now the bug 's been fixed we can all get back to the business of posting pictures of sunsets , baby photos and controversial political opinions .

Virgin Media mobile customers rejoice ! 4G is finally being rolled out for you , allowing you to harness the power of EE ’ s superfast network . There ’ s more to the rollout than faster internet though , with Virgin also offering customers free WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger action . That means any message , picture or video you send on either social app will not be deducted from your data allowance if you opt for one of the new mobile plans . This doesn ’ t include voice and video calls within the applications though , so you ’ ll still burn through your data using these functions if you ’ re not connected to Wi-Fi . The new Virgin Media tariffs also allow you to roll over any unused data to the next month – although the rolled-over data will expire when you finish that month . A Virgin Media spokesperson told us : “ The rolled-over data does not accumulate – it lasts one month . However , there is no limit to how much contract data someone can rollover . “ For example , if you ’ re on a 20GB contract and you only use 15GB in January then 5GB is transferred to February . If you only use 1GB data in the whole of February then 20GB is transferred to March ( the 4GB of rolled over data from January expires ) . ” 4G has been a long wait for Virgin Media customers , with the faster network having been available on all the major networks for quite some time . `` We wanted to make sure we launched 4G properly and wanted to do something different from our competitors , which is why we ’ re offering free messaging on WhatsApp and Messenger , '' the spokesperson told us . We 're still waiting to hear if access to the full EE network – which features 'double speed ' for higher-paying customers – will be offered to Virgin Media users . We 've contacted the network again to clarify , and will update the story if we find out .

Ever since Facebook spun Messenger out as its own separate app , Mark Zuckerberg and his team have been pushing the idea of Messenger as a platform - not just a place to chat with ( or ignore ) friends , but somewhere you can run apps , do your shopping , send payments and more besides . According to reports over the weekend , gaming is going to be the next big step forward for Messenger , with some of the major studios ( like Candy Crush maker King ) said to be prepping titles for an imminent launch . `` Instant Games '' is the name of the new feature , say sources speaking to The Information . It 's no secret that Facebook wants to bring games to Messenger - we 've already seen some basic efforts made by Facebook appear , and if you know the right tricks you can already launch mini football , basketball and chess games inside the chat app . This new roll-out seems to be on a whole new level though , and marks a fresh attempt by Facebook to get you to stay inside its own walled garden rather than drifting away to those other app and game stores owned by the likes of Google and Apple . In an ideal world , Mark Zuckerberg would want you to only have to install Facebook and Messenger on your phone - and putting games inside Messenger would be part of that . You 'd be able to challenge your friends directly inside the app and Facebook could potentially take a cut of in-game purchases . The insider sources say a development kit is arriving later this month so watch this space for an official announcement - and watch your Messenger app for a new invasion of mini games and challenges from your Facebook friends .

Even if you ca n't go home for the holidays , Facebook Messenger just made it easier than ever to connect with friends and family far and wide . The social network 's messaging app has added the ability to hold video chats in groups , letting you talk face-to-face with as many as 50 ( ! ) people in one go . That trounces the number of participants you can have in a Google Hangout or Skype video call , both of which are limited to 10 . Facebook says group video chatting is the most requested Messenger feature ever , and it 's available globally starting today on iOS , Android and the desktop version of Messenger . Part of the fun - though only on iOS for now - is putting on 3D masks during your chat , lending some Snapchat-like silliness to your video conversations . To start a group video chat , you 'll first need to make sure you have the most recent version of Messenger . Once you 've settled that , head into an existing group chat or start a new one , then tap the video icon in the upper right hand corner . This will prompt a video chat , and everyone in the group will receive a heads up it 's started . Other participants can join with a tap , though you can call individuals or the whole group directly . Once chats hit more than six participants , only the dominant speaker will be shown to the group , though everyone can still talk and be on video . Chatters can choose whether they want to participate only by audio , or be on camera . Group video chats are yet another way Facebook is connecting us , and another feature it 's adding against the likes of FaceTime , Hangouts , Skype , WhatsApp ( which Facebook owns ) , and other messaging platforms .

In its ongoing mission to do everything every other app can do , Facebook has given a select number of users the option to make group audio calls straight from its desktop site . Watch out , Skype and Hangouts . You can see if you 've got the feature yourself - just log into Facebook on the web , open up a group chat window , and you might see a phone call icon and a notification that the new functionality is now available to you . The same group calling option was added to the mobile version of Messenger in April , so now those of us using old-fashioned computers rather than phones can get involved too . There 's no word yet on when the feature might make it to everyone 's account , but there seems no reason why Facebook would take its time pushing it out . Of course the advantage Facebook has is that pretty much everyone 's already on the network - although people are perhaps less likely to have office colleagues added as friends , and this is a feature with uses for both work and leisure . Group audio calling is n't the only tweak Facebook 's making to its site this weekend : it 's also experimenting with new options for hiding adverts that bring up painful memories . At the moment the trial is restricted to parenting products and alcohol-related ads but Facebook says it may expand it further in the future . While the social network has let users tweak ad settings for a while , this is the first time it 's offered the option to pro-actively block certain topics that might be upsetting . Via TechCrunch

Facebook is finally starting to act on fake news , announcing today a number of features it 's testing to combat the spread of misinformation . The social network is beginning by going after `` the worst of the worst , '' posts that are blatantly false and generated for spammers ' own gain , writes Adam Mosseri , the vice president who oversees Facebook 's News Feed , in a blog post . Perhaps the most significant feature it 's trialing is tapping into third-party fact checkers to analyze the veracity of an article . Facebook will send suspicious stories to a fact-checking partner organization , among them Snopes , PolitiFact and ABC News , reports The New York Times . If the org decides it 's playing loose with facts , the post will be flagged as disputed . A link to an article explaining why the post is under scrutiny will also be included . Though users can still share disputed stories , these may be pushed down lower in the News Feed . Even more in your face - a warning will pop up when users go to share the story . Flagged stories will also be banned from being promoted and turned into ads , Mosseri says . Facebook is also turning to users , testing a way for the community to flag a post they believe is a hoax . After clicking the upper right hand corner of a post , some users will see the option to select `` It 's a fake news story '' as the reason they 're singling it out for attention . And the steps do n't stop there . Facebook is looking into incorporating signals that a story is fake into how it ranks articles , such as people not sharing an article after they 've read it , usually an indication they found it misleading . Finally , Facebook is going to hit spammers where it hurts : their wallets . Because hoaxers make money when they pose as legit news organizations and direct users to their ad-filled sites , Facebook is getting rid of the ability to spoof domains . It will also look at publisher sites to see where policy enforcement may be needed . Even though these features are part of a small test for now , it 's a change of course for Facebook , which has been accused of sticking its head in the sand when it comes to its role as a source ( and often , the source ) of information . While it does n't want to become the arbiter of truth , as Mosseri writes , Facebook is at least recognizing that , with over a billion people on its service , it has to take fake news more seriously . Depending on what it learns from these trials , Facebook will release the fake news-fighting features more widely .

While Facebook is a booming host for video content , be it Vox infographics or time-lapsed Tasty recipes , the social media giant is n't content with simply hosting video - it wants to start putting out some of its own . It appears that Facebook is in the market to license out original video content , with interest ranging anywhere from scripted shows to game competitions to possibly even sports , according to Recode . Though Facebook 's recent push for video has included signing companies like Vox Media to produce exclusive live content , it 's looking to bring more specialized entertainment to the Video tab . `` Our goal is to kickstart an ecosystem of partner content for the tab , '' says Ricky Van Veen , who recently joined Facebook to lead its original content efforts , `` so we 're exploring funding some seed video content , including original and licensed scripted , unscripted , and sports content , that takes advantage of mobile and the social interaction unique to Facebook . '' Considering that signing up for a Facebook account is free - and that the service has a stingy policy towards ads - it 's unclear what the monetization incentive will be for partners of Facebook 's original video venture . Sports broadcasts , for instance , are extremely cagey about licensing out games without some kind of major return-on-investment , and usually a few hundred thousand 'likes ' wo n't cut it . Also uncertain is who the target demographic will be , considering Facebook has over a billion active daily users from all over the world . Facebook 's next step certainly creates more questions than answers , though we hope the firm takes a note from Netflix and brings quality programming instead of cheaper sharebait like YouTube 's 'premium ' prank shows .

Instagram is rolling out live video inside Stories to all US users starting today , the picture-ific social network has announced . Now , anyone can start broadcasting to their followers for up to an hour at a time . When you 're done recording , the video disappears , never to be seen again . If the disappearing act reminds you of Snapchat , you 're not wrong . Some may wonder what the point of an instantly deleted video is ( parent company Facebook lets you keep live videos if you want ) , but as Instagram sees it , you 'll `` feel comfortable sharing what you want , anytime . '' Instagram seems keen to foster a spontaneous , pressure-free sharing experience when it comes to live video , though some users may feel frustrated they ca n't save a particularly stellar broadcast once they stop recording . To go live , swipe right into the stories camera and switch on `` Live '' . Viewers can comment and like your video as you 're broadcasting , and you can pin a comment for all to see , or disable comments altogether . To watch live video , just look for the highlighted profiles in the Stories bar . New live stories will be posted in the Explore tab , and Top Live will highlight the most popular videos of the moment . It 's little surprise Instagram is pushing live video out of the test kitchen considering just about every other social network - especially parent company Facebook - is banking their hopes on user-generated broadcasts . Instagram is late to the live game , but considering it has over 500 million monthly active users and over 300 million users daily , live video might only help to bolster those numbers , plus keep people on the service for longer . Though live video is only available to US users right now , Instagram plans on launching the feature in other regions over the coming weeks . Stay tuned .

Do n't panic if you 've suddenly seen photos that are several months old resurface at the top of your Facebook News Feed : you have n't just stepped back in time . It 's a known bug and Facebook is currently trying to fix it . Users started reporting the issue as the weekend began and based on media reports it seems to be reasonably widespread . The problem is certainly substantial enough for Facebook to have taken notice and started the process of poking around inside its code . `` We are aware of this and are investigating , '' a Facebook spokesperson told PCMag . It seems the posts are being published as new ( without any comments or likes ) , but from the updates that have been seen so far , only previously shared images are affected - so you wo n't suddenly see your private pictures show up on your timeline . Of course there are several Facebook features that rely on bringing back old posts for a regular nostalgia blast , including the `` year in review '' highlights packages that start appearing at this time . It 's possible that one of these integrated functions has gone haywire , but there 's no official word yet . In the meantime the best option for users is to double-check their feeds and delete anything that should n't be there .

Facebook , Twitter , Microsoft and YouTube have announced that they ’ re planning to work together and share their expertise to formulate a strategy to counter the spread of terrorist content online . How exactly are they aiming to do this ? Well , the companies have said they ’ ll create a shared industry database that will enable them to identify violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos by assigning them unique identifiers called hashes . If one of the companies removes extremist content it ’ ll be assigned a unique hash and logged in this database , making it easier for the other networks to flag it and remove it from their own platforms . In a joint blog post the companies said “ There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on [ their ] hosted consumer services ” , adding that they hope that by collaborating in this way they ’ ll become more efficient at identifying and removing extremist content . This isn ’ t the first time the companies have banded together to help one another flag up harmful content ; last year they used a similar method to identify and prevent the spread of child pornography . When an image or video is identified as containing extremist content it won ’ t be automatically deleted from the other networks . Each company still has the freedom to make sure the content that ’ s been flagged up violates its terms of service before deleting it . The move comes not long after these companies agreed with the European Union to remove content which qualifies as hate speech or propaganda within 24 hours of being notified . This database should certainly make it much easier to act at an appropriate speed , though it does n't guarantee that all extremist content will be stopped . The companies also promise , though , that their users ’ privacy won ’ t be compromised , insisting that “ no personally identifiable information will be shared ” . That doesn ’ t mean it won ’ t be stored , however , as there ’ s also the promise that “ each company will continue to apply its practice of transparency and review for any government requests ” . Though the collaboration is only between Facebook , Microsoft , Twitter and YouTube at the moment , the plan is to expand access to the database and include other companies in the future . Here ’ s looking at you , Google .

Update : In a Facebook Live broadcast , Trump announced Neil Gorsuch as his nominee for the US Supreme Court . The Live video on the White House 's Facebook page as 3.8 million views as of 11:07pm PT Tuesday . Original story continues below ... President Donald Trump will reveal his choice to fill a vacant justice seat on the US Supreme Court via Facebook Live tonight , turning to the platform in an unprecedented move for such an announcement . The White House and the president announced the streaming plans on - where else - Twitter earlier Tuesday . The broadcast takes place at 5pm PT/8pm ET/1am GMT on the White House Facebook page . We asked Facebook for comment on Trump 's broadcast , including how the social network views this as part of Live 's role in the political process and whether the company will offer any additional support for the stream . A Facebook spokesperson got back to us with the following statement : `` We are available to provide advice and best practices to the White House , as we do for many elected officials , '' the Facebook rep told us . `` We are not providing any technical assistance or staff for tonight ’ s Facebook Live broadcast . '' Join me live from the @ WhiteHouse at 8:00pm tonight . # SCOTUS https : //t.co/7OJvZaW0Y7 pic.twitter.com/nJyeYyACQ1January 31 , 2017 Trump 's use of Facebook Live and the timing of the announcement are unusual for several reasons . For one , it takes place during prime time TV hours , turning the monumental decision into something of a reality show . Presidents have in the past made their Supreme Court picks public during daytime press conferences . Lending to the reality show feel is that the two front-runners - judges Neil Gorsuch and Thomas Hardiman - are reportedly in Washington D.C. in anticipation of the announcement , according to CNN . One will leave with the nomination , the other with nothing . Trump 's announcement is set to air on TV - broadcasters will interrupt regularly scheduled programming to deliver it - however by using Facebook Live , Trump can avoid commentary from networks . As Trump and the media 's relationship grows more contentious , this could be the first of more announcements delivered via social media to come . Facebook has pushed hard on video in recent years , particularly when it comes to Live ( you may have seen the commercials ) . Live was used extensively during the US presidential election by candidates - Trump included - to connect with constituents , and it appears now that he is president , he has no plans to stop using the service . While Facebook has paid celebrities and other publishers for Live content in the past , a Facebook spokesperson tells Recode , `` There are no incentives or Live partnerships with the President or the White House .

In its never-ending quest to serve you more video , Facebook is introducing a new way to rank clips in your News Feed , one that holds particular benefit for videos on the longer side . The social media behemoth will now place greater weight on the `` percent completion '' rate for longer videos over shorter ones . If a longer video was watched most or all the way through , that 's a good indicator people found it worth viewing , Facebook reasons . The move should surface longer videos - that are compelling enough to earn a strong percent completion figure - and avoid penalizing them if more people completed a shorter video , which is , by definition , easier to watch beginning to end . You wo n't suddenly see longer videos littering your News Feed , Facebook assures , saying that it expects only a slight increase in distribution . Shorter videos may see a `` slight dip '' as a result of the change . If you 're big on creating Facebook videos and want to expand your audience , follow the rule of making a video as long as it needs to be in order to tell a compelling and engaging story . The video ranking change will roll out over the coming weeks , Facebook says . In the meantime , check out the new secure log-in feature Facebook introduced earlier today .
Facebook is showing a real commitment to improving user security today with its announcement that it ’ ll now support USB security keys as part of its two-factor account authentication . Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your Facebook account . When you attempt to log in to your profile from a new device you ’ re sent a security code via SMS to enter in addition to your password , making it much harder for someone else to access your account even if they have your standard entry code . With USB security keys , your second factor of authentication becomes a physical device that you plug into your computer instead . This does of course mean that you have to carry your security key around with you everywhere in the event that you ’ ll have to use it , and you also have to make sure you have the latest version of Chrome or Opera installed . But it has the benefit of being more immediate than an SMS . In addition , they ’ re also secure against phishing attacks as you do n't have to enter a code yourself and the hardware provides cryptographic proof that it 's in your machine . As services such as Google , Dropbox , and Github already support security keys as part of their two-factor authentication systems and these keys can be used for multiple accounts , it could end up being the most convenient way for you to keep multiple accounts safe . However , more people than ever now use Facebook on their mobile rather than on their computers . Though Facebook doesn ’ t support USB security keys on its mobile app , it has made it possible for users with NFC-capable Android devices with the latest version of Chrome and Google Authenticator installed to use NFC-capable keys to log in from the mobile site . Facebook is the first major platform to support these fairly new NFC-capable keys and it ’ s a fairly limited system since it only works on Android devices with the Facebook mobile site rather than its app . This means that it probably won ’ t be widely picked up by Facebook users right away , but it ’ s a good indication of what will be possible in terms of account security on mobile in the future . That 's not all Facebook has done to make its users feel more secure , either . Though it 's a smaller chance , the social media giant has also improved its Privacy Basics page to make it easier for people to control what they 're revealing about themselves on Facebook . Though the privacy options themselves have n't changed , the new page is more clearly laid out and makes it easier to understand what information can be seen by whom . If you still get lost , it also has 32 interactive guides in 44 languages to keep you on track .
Facebook Messenger is set to undergo a big change in the near future – the company is bringing adverts to the app for the very first time . Adverts won ’ t appear in your chats , but instead in your main menu . It 'll be much like when Messenger notifies you to chat with somebody because it 's their birthday or that they ’ re currently online . Ads will appear with a brand , a picture and a short description . If you tap on it you 'll start what Facebook is calling an “ ad-experience ” - essentially a chat - with a brand to learn more information . What the `` ad-experiences '' will look like is n't currently clear , but we think it will be similar to a chat with one of Facebook Messenger ’ s Bots . Facebook wrote in a blog post , `` For the Messenger community , it may enhance the discovery of new experiences to make it seamless to interact with businesses on their terms . `` For businesses , it could offer a new way to surface their products and services to current and potential customers . '' Right now the feature is just in a test stage for Australia and Thailand , but if it 's a success Facebook is sure to roll the feature out around the world as soon as possible .

Sometimes the biggest exploits come from the smallest of places . This turned out to be the case for Facebook , as researcher/computer whiz Dan Melamed managed to find a simple trick that lets a user turn off comments - and outright delete - videos uploaded by someone else . The exploit Melamed reported is deceptively straightforward . The basic explanation is that while uploading their own video to an event page , a user can change the video 's ID number mid-post to that of another user 's video . This results in the targeted video being uploaded instead , along with the unintended user now having control over it . This would allow them to either disable comments or delete the video entirely , just as if they were authorized by the video 's original owner . While that might be a blessing to anyone with a compromising video of them online from that crazy New Year 's party or anything else best kept off Facebook , Melamed saw the potential harm in the bug and demonstrated it to the social media giant so it could be patched . The icing on the cake ? For his efforts , Melamed was awarded a $ 10,000 bounty by Facebook shortly after showing the social media company the exploit . Even though Melamed reported the bug last summer , you can now see the so-called hack in motion in the video below : Via Gizmodo

We ’ ve become a world of over sharers . Whether it ’ s endless tweets of your lunch , overdoing the Instagram selfies or those Snapchats we ’ d rather didn ’ t fall into the wrong hands , we ’ re all guilty . Facebook , though , remains the biggest culprit in our social sharing addiction . While simply overdoing the humble brags , inspiring quotes and fitness session posts that scream ‘ I want attention ’ are annoying , they ’ re not going to do any worse than costing you a couple of friends . There ’ s plenty on your Facebook page just waiting to stab you in the back though . Those forgotten posts and profile additions that , in the wrong hands could not only damage your reputation but cost you big . Worried ? Don ’ t be , just make sure you ’ ve deleted this lot from your Facebook profile before relaxing . This isn ’ t the days of MSN messenger when you hoped that guy/girl you were crushing on would see your digits and drop you a text . The Facebook world is a less innocent place . Yes , putting your phone number on your profile might have seemed a good idea six years ago when Facebook told you it needed it for improved security , but it ’ s really not . No , Facebook won ’ t sell your data , but that doesn ’ t mean it ’ s safe . People can skim your account for personal details or simply use it like a bored teen for prank calls . Even if nothing bad comes from it , no good will arise either , so better to play it safe . You might want the world to know that your recent night out was “ # epicbants ” , but unless you ’ ve got your Facebook privacy settings cranked up to 11 , it ’ s not just your online friends who can see them . As well as disappointing your now internet-savvy parents , these photos could come back to haunt you , and even cost you that dream job you ’ ve just applied for . Social media checks are now becoming a staple of employers ' pre-job offer hit list . Stumbling across 42 snaps of your slumped outside a club in a vomit-stained shirt isn ’ t going to impress them . Either delete them now - you ’ re better than that anyway - or improve your privacy . You can do this by heading to Settings > Privacy and toggling the settings under both the ‘ Who can see my stuff ? ’ and ‘ Who can look me up ? ’ menus . It ’ s nice when people you ’ ve not heard from since your last birthday drop you a “ Happy b ’ day , mate ” message on the big day . It ’ s a little ego rub that makes you feel liked and important . Your date of birth can be pinched for less wholesome uses than an annual greeting though . Along with your name and address , your date of birth is one of the few pieces of information identity thieves need to imitate you and do no good , so why give it up so freely ? Surely not having your identity compromised is more important than your Facebook ‘ friends ’ knowing when to copy and paste their generic birthday wishes , right ? With your name already displayed and your date of birth on show , all that stands between you and your identity being assumed is… Tagging your location on Facebook tells everyone what a well travelled , worldly person you are . If you ’ re not getting your fill at the latest hipster eatery or painting the town red , you ’ re tagging yourself at more mundane places like your home . Don ’ t though , seriously . All you ’ re doing is giving away your address and , as we ’ ve already seen , that ’ s just one of the bits needed to give away your identity . There are plenty of other places you shouldn ’ t be tagging yourself either . Dropping the kids off at school ? Don ’ t let the world know , that ’ s just not smart . Nor is letting the world know when you ’ re out of the country . It ’ s OK to share your sausage or legs poolside holiday photos in a bid to make your mates jealous - that ’ s pretty much what Facebook is for . Your humble Bragbook posts can wait until you ’ re back though . As well as coming across as a bit of a moron whose idea of a great getaway is sat on Facebook in a new location , all these photos do is broadcast to the world that ‘ hey , my home ’ s going to be empty for the next week , have at it burglars ’ . Even if you ’ ve got your privacy levels up and all those likes and shares you covet aren ’ t going to display your absence to wider Facebook , how many of those 643 Facebook ‘ friends ’ you chalked up when you were at uni do you still really know and trust now ? Managed to secure that dream job despite your less than glittering social presence ? Then whatever you do , don ’ t add your boss on Facebook thinking it will win you day-one brownie points . Twitter , sure , LinkedIn , definitely , but not Facebook . It ’ s just asking for trouble , and not only when you ignore our advice and get those drunk photos flowing again . There have been multiple instances of Facebook users losing their jobs for views and opinions expressed on the social networking site . Even if you ’ re not slagging off your employer all too publicly , there are still pitfalls waiting to capture you . When your friends tag you in photos of that day out at the beach when you called in sick , you ’ re going to get rumbled . It works both ways too . Do you really need to see images of your boss lounging by the pool , scantily clad and lobster red on their next holiday ? It will make Monday ’ s meeting all sorts of uncomfortable . It might sound petty and small , but hear us out , it ’ s time to delete those pictures of your ex . Not only could it cause issues with future spouses - like the job hire thing , potential partners now take a thorough scan of your social feeds before agreeing to that second date - Facebook ’ s not always the most courteous and caring with its memory reminders . Services like Time Hop regularly drag up long-forgotten pictures and posts in a bid to make you all happy and nostalgic . Basing much of this on how popular the original post was , it doesn ’ t always work out positively for your memory glands . If you were on the receiving end of serious heartbreak and still struggling with the loss , the last thing you want to see is “ We thought you ’ d like to see this picture from one year ago ” messages only to be confronted by a snap of you and the former other half all loved up . Keep the pictures in some form , sure , but do your future self a favor and take them off Facebook . We ’ ve all got that one friend . The one that didn ’ t quite grow up at the same rate as the rest of the group . The one that isn ’ t looking to advance their career , doesn ’ t have new friends in new places and who still thinks it ’ s hilarious to tag you in questionable memes and straight up inappropriate images . It ’ s the friend that puts your new life in jeopardy every time you see their name mentioned in your notifications tab . Not only should you delete anything dodgy they ’ ve tagged you in in the past , you should prevent it ever happening again . To do that you ’ ll need to set up ‘ Timeline Review ’ . Thankfully , it ’ s an easy task . On either the Facebook mobile app or through the desktop service head to Settings > Timeline and Tagging > Who can add things to my timeline and switch the ‘ review posts ’ option to ‘ on ’ . Now , you ’ ll need to approve all posts you ’ re tagged in before they make it onto your timeline and are visible to the wider world . Yes , it ’ s a bit more hassle for the 95 % of innocence that makes it to your page , but it will catch the bad ones before they become serious problems .

Facebook 's Mark Zuckerberg has posted 5,500 word missive on the social network , in which he discusses many topics – including how the company aims to tackle the promotion of terrorist activities and so-called `` fake news '' using AI and algorithms . The size of the global Facebook community , with more than a billion people posting several billion messages and posts each day , has made it impossible for individuals to effectively police the network in its entirety . `` The complexity of the issues we 've seen has outstripped our existing processes for governing the community , '' said Zuckerberg . `` We are researching systems that can read text and look at photos and videos to understand if anything dangerous may be happening . '' However , Zuckerberg admits that these systems will take time to perfect . `` This is still very early in development , but we have started to have it look at some content , and it already generates about one third of all reports to the team that reviews content , '' he continued . `` Right now , we 're starting to explore ways to use AI to tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and actual terrorist propaganda . '' It 's an approach that could help turn the tide against unreliable , `` fake '' news sources too , though Zuckerberg also notes that the nuances a human can discern between tasteful and trustworthy and distasteful and untrustworthy content will initially be difficult for an AI to comprehend . `` It 's worth noting that major advances in AI are required to understand text , photos and videos to judge whether they contain hate speech , graphic violence , sexually explicit content , and more , '' he said . `` At our current pace of research , we hope to begin handling some of these cases in 2017 , but others will not be possible for many years . '' So , despite the long term goal , the crux of Facebook 's defences will remain , for the time being at least , within community moderation . `` Where is your line on nudity ? On violence ? On graphic content ? On profanity ? What you decide will be your personal settings , '' Zuckerberg said . `` For those who do n't make a decision , the default will be whatever the majority of people in your region selected , like a referendum .

Facebook is moving forcefully into the personal space of LinkedIn today with the announcement that it ’ s rolling out new features that will enable job posting and application directly on the site . In a blog post , Facebook stated that starting today businesses in the US and Canada would be able to post job openings which future employees would be able to easily find either on that business ’ page or in the new jobs bookmark . According to Facebook , the entire process will be simple for businesses as page admins will be able to set up job listings , track applications and directly communicate with applicants all on the Facebook site . Things should be simpler for applicants too . Rather than trawling through several job sites , the idea is that you could come across your dream position simply doing your habitual News Feed scroll . Though you ’ ll also be able to do a more targeted search and find postings in the jobs bookmark and on specific pages . To apply for a job you simply click the Apply Now button and a form that ’ s been pre-filled with all the information you ’ ve already supplied to Facebook via your profile will appear for quick and easy submission . To add more convenience it can all be done on your mobile too . This isn ’ t the first step Facebook has taken into our working lives . Late last year the social media giant launched Workplace , a kind of cross between Facebook and Slack that allowed people to stay connected and communicate in their workplace without using their everyday Facebook account . That said , this particular feature does use your personal Facebook profile so if yours doesn ’ t quite paint you as a professional paragon , we ’ d advise you to fix it up before you start applying for anything . At the moment the feature is only available to users in the US and Canada with no indication as to when or if it ’ ll be available in other regions .

You know the drill : Facebook is big on video , releasing near-constant updates and features to get more eyeballs on moving pictures in the News Feed . Now , the social network took it one step further , announcing its biggest move in quite a while : a new Facebook video app for TV . With the new app , you can watch videos shared by your pals and Pages you follow , tune into top Live videos and view recommended videos right on your big screen . You can also watch videos you 've saved for later , plus rewatch clips you 've already seen , shared or uploaded yourself . Previously , you could stream videos from the Facebook app on your phone or tablet to your TV , but the new app creates a native experience , removing the need for a secondary device and putting Facebook videos directly into your television set . Facebook 's app is similar to the Netflix app , just filled with videos from your friends ' timelines . Facebook 's video app will roll out to the respective app stores for Apple TV , Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV soon , and more platforms will be added down the road , Facebook said in a blog post . News of the app comes as Facebook moves into creating original content - including recently hiring a former MTV executive - and embracing longer videos , all with the aim of increasing viewer numbers and time spent watching videos . Could you one day curl up on the couch , open the Facebook video app on your TV and watch an original Facebook show from start to finish ? It certainly sounds like that 's where CEO Mark Zuckerberg and co. want the service to go , and fast . In addition to the Facebook video app for TV , Facebook is also rolling out a few tweaks to enhance the viewing experience on mobile . For starters , audio for Facebook videos will now play automatically if the sound on your phone is turned on . If it 's set to silent , you wo n't hear a peep . This eliminates the need to tap a video to make the sound audible . Noise will fade in and out as you scroll through your Feed to more videos . If you 're content to keep videos muted , head into Settings and switch `` Videos in News Feed Start With Sound '' to the off position . Facebook is also improving how we watch vertical videos , introducing a larger format that expands the view to take up more of your phone screen . This is rolling out to everyone on iOS and Android . Finally , for those multi-taskers who want to watch a clip while simultaneously flipping through their News Feed , there 's now a picture-in-picture view that shrinks a video and sticks it in the corner of your screen so you can keep it rolling as you scroll . Android users can even take the miniature view outside of the Facebook app , continuing their watch party while jumping around their phone . In addition to developing its own shows , the biggest question surrounding Facebook video is how the social network can make money off of user- and partner-generated content . This is an ongoing conundrum for the social network , but introducing a new platform - the TV - into the mix may be a strong selling point Facebook can use to woo advertisers . We 'll see how this all unfolds as the app becomes available and new features take hold , but Facebook is n't hitting pause on its video plans any time soon , that 's for sure .

Facebook has announced that it ’ s extending its Safety Check feature to allow users to seek and offer help in times of emergency as well as notify friends and family that they ’ re safe . Called Community Help , the new feature will let users offer things like food , shelter and transportation after a crisis and provide those seeking such things a means of finding access to them . The feature will activate whenever Safety Check is triggered in a particular area whether as the result of a natural disaster or an accidental emergency such as a building fire . To use Community Help a user will simply have to access Safety Check when it appears , after which they ’ ll be able to make a post seeking or offering help . Those seeking help will then be able to organize posts by category and location and directly message anyone offering what they need . Just like Safety Check , this is an idea that ’ s been inspired by and grown from trends Facebook has picked up on in its own user base . Having noticed that in times of disaster people tended to offer help to others in their community via Facebook posts and Groups , Facebook has now formalized a way to do so , saying `` we knew we could do more . '' Despite good intentions , Facebook 's Safety Check has n't had the smoothest run and Katherine Woo has explained the challenges of implementing the feature . At launch , Community Help will be available in the US , Canada , Australia , New Zealand and Saudi Arabia , with Facebook saying it ’ ll be rolled out to more countries at a later date . You can see a video detailing Community Help below :

YouTube is strengthening its position in the livestream sphere today with the announcement that it ’ s introducing a new mobile live stream feature . The feature will only be available to `` Creators '' with more than 10,000 subscribers for now but it ’ ll be rolled out to all other users eventually . If you ’ re one of the hundreds of thousands of people with more than 10,000 subscribers , getting a mobile livestream going is a straightforward process as the feature has been built directly into the YouTube mobile app . All you have to do is open the mobile app , hit the capture button and you ’ re live . Streamed videos won ’ t be any different from regular YouTube videos in terms of features – they can still be searched for , found via recommendations and playlists , and they ’ re also still protected from unauthorized use . YouTube has been working on the feature with creators to refine it before its launch , using their feedback to to make improvements . One improvement , for example is that live chat has been slowed down – perhaps now if you stumble upon a busy live stream you ’ ll actually be able to read the messages that are posted . There ’ s also another new feature that ’ ll accompany mobile livestreams called Super Chat . YouTube has dubbed this “ a new live stream monetization tool . ” We ’ ve all seen how quickly the chat section on a livestream can move , with fans desperate to directly contact their favorite creators . Super Chat will enable any fan watching a livestream to purchase a chat message that will be highlighted in bright colors and stay pinned to the top of the chat window for up to five hours . The idea is that this is the best chance to have your message noticed by the creator that ’ s doing the livestream while giving them the chance to make some money out of using the livestream feature . YouTube has been in the livestreaming game since 2011 and it 's continued to improve upon its service through offering 4K streams and supporting 360 degree live content . However , with Facebook , Instagram , and Snapchat all making instant video sharing more mobile than ever with their live services , YouTube really had to do this to keep up with the competition . Though it ’ s fairly late to the game with this new feature , YouTube will still hold the edge in terms of attracting high profile creators . Not only will they be able to keep all of their video content in one place rather than splitting themselves across several social channels to interact with fans , Super Chat will enable them to monetize their content in a way that other services don ’ t . You can see more about livestreaming via mobile through the video below :

Palmer Luckey is leaving Facebook and Oculus , the company he co-founded and eventually sold to the social network for $ 2 billion in 2014 . Luckey is best known as the creator of Oculus Rift , the virtual reality headset that reignited the public 's interest in VR and has seen several high-end competitors emerge in its wake . Oculus Rift , however , is the headset that started it all . `` Palmer will be dearly missed , '' an Oculus spokesperson said in a statement to TechRadar . `` Palmer 's legacy extends far beyond Oculus . His inventive spirit helped kickstart the modern VR revolution and build an industry . We 're thankful for everything he did for Oculus and VR , and we wish him all the best . '' It 's not known whether Luckey 's leaving is voluntary , or whether he 'll be involved with Oculus or Facebook in any capacity moving forward ; Oculus declined to offer comment beyond its statement . This Friday is Luckey 's last official day with Facebook , according to Upload VR . In many ways Luckey has been the face of the recent virtual reality revival ; his early prototypes , sometimes wrapped in duct tape , stormed onto the scene in 2012 and immediately captured enthusiasts ' imaginations . A successful Kickstarter campaign only added to excitement around Rift , and it became clear , as the headset made it to developers and subsequent prototypes were refined , that the dream of mainstream , accessible and immersive VR could become a reality . Facebook swooped in with a $ 2 billion check three years ago , buying Oculus in a move that signaled the social network saw the potential for virtual reality to be more than a gaming platform . Facebook views VR as an entirely new way for people to interact with one another , and Luckey told us in 2016 that Oculus also held this vision long before Facebook came to the table . `` Our vision has never been to just be a gaming company , '' Luckey said at the time . The consumer version of Oculus Rift went up for pre-order in January 2016 , and Luckey hand-delivered the first headset to a customer in Alaska that March . `` I 've been working on this thing for so long , and you 're the first person to actually get one , '' Luckey said as he delivered the headset . `` So it 's kind of like me taking all this work and handing it off to you , so you 've got to make sure you have fun with it , or something . '' But , as Oculus Rift continued to sell , and eventually launched Touch controllers to bring even more immersion to the experience , Luckey faded from the spotlight . Controversy surrounded him during the 2016 US presidential election when reports surfaced that he supported a right wing , pro-Donald Trump group called Nimble America . Luckey wrote in a September Facebook post that he had donated to the group , but also denied reports he was its founder or that he wrote posts under the pseudonym NimbleRichMan . Luckey skipped the company 's third Oculus Connect conference in October , letting Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg lead the proceedings . An Oculus executive told Polygon at the conference that , `` Palmer decided not to attend OC3 because he did n't want to be a distraction . '' Then earlier this year , major game publisher ZeniMax sued Oculus , saying the company stole its intellectual property in order to create Rift . The case saw Luckey and Zuckerberg take the stand , and eventually a jury awarded ZeniMax $ 500 million in damages . Luckey , who the jury found violated a non-disclosure agreement , is on the hook for part of that sum . Oculus plans to appeal the ruling , and it could be years before the case is settled . Even before Luckey 's departure , changes to Oculus ' leadership had taken place , most notably in December when then-CEO Brendan Iribe stepped down to lead the company 's PC VR efforts . With Luckey gone , not much should change with Oculus ' day-to-day , though the company and its parent Facebook can no longer tap the wunderkind who 's so passionately promoted virtual reality over the last five years . The direction of Oculus Rift as a product seems fairly well laid out as well ; Oculus recently announced a price drop that should help it compete even more closely with HTC Vive . The company has put a premium on great content and building developer relations , and with the help of Facebook , is working to turn virtual reality into a viable personal computing platform , not just a way to game . As for its hardware , Oculus and Facebook announced a tetherless headset is in the works , which speaks to a vision Luckey also shared with us that VR headsets will eventually need to cut the PC cord . Oculus recently hired a long-time Apple veteran to lead its hardware efforts , and gloves that allow for controller-less input are also in the works , as teased by Zuckerberg last month . Though Luckey will no longer be involved with Facebook or Oculus , and therefore with the development of Rift , he helped lay important groundwork for the modern VR revolution . Putting controversy aside , his work on virtual reality has contributed to a proliferation of excellent headsets and experiences , and his impact will likely be felt for decades to come . What 's more , he 's only 24 , so there 's no telling what new venture he 'll take on next .
They say it takes a village to raise a child , but a well-knit community can also come in a pinch for financial emergencies , such as an unexpected medical expense , disaster relief , or college tuition . To help enable more peer-to-peer giving , Facebook is expanding its charitable giving tools to allow users to set up GoFundMe-style fundraisers for themselves , a nonprofit organization , or another individual . The feature currently lets a user set up a page to help address one of six specified monetary needs : education , medicine , pet medicine , crisis relief , personal emergencies , and funerals . From there , the fundraiser undergoes a 24 hour-long review process before going live for your Facebook friends to share , comment on , and donate to . You can also see which friends contributed to your cause , or invite others to join in . For existing nonprofit pages , Facebook is also adding donation buttons that go up alongside Facebook Live broadcasts — perfect for chipping in a little without interrupting your digital-era telethon or charity livestream . Facebook 's fundraiser feature rolls out in beta starting this week for users in the US . An important note : the social media giant has made it clear you must be 18 or older to set up a crowdfunding page .

Facebook Live is adding a whole new way to stream events and daily goings-on as the streaming platform opens up 360-degree video to all users . So long as you 've got the equipment handy , you can now broadcast 360-degree video live on Facebook almost exactly the same way as a normal airing , including the option to choose what audiences and regions your stream reaches , as well as see comments and reactions . The news comes to us courtesy of Insta360 , which develops its own line of 360-degree cameras for Android and Apple devices . In the video below , the company shows how to get started with 360-degree streaming on Facebook Live , using its own Insta360 Nano and accompanying app to create a fully functioning livestream in just a few short steps . In addition to the usual Facebook Live settings , you can change the connection quality up to ( or even above ) the recommended dose of 4Mbps to help customize a nice balance of good picture and smooth performance . To use 360-degree video on Facebook Live , you 'll need to make sure your compatible camera has its firmware updated to support Facebook Live or set it up manually via the social media site .

Facebook is going all in on a new suite of features for sharing your goings-on without cluttering your News Feed with images only meant to be seen once . Specifically , the social network is adding special filters to its camera feature , augmenting your selfies , video and more with special overlays , such as an ad-sponsored Power Ranger helmet or a stylized masks that shows what you 'd look like as a sloth . Because , why not . The update also adds Stories to Facebook , allowing for images , video or replies to pop up at the top of your News Feed for people to enjoy for 24 hours before it disappears . Facebook is also allowing users to send Stories to a select person or group via another feature called Direct , should you not want to share pics from your latest bar escapades with everyone you 're friends with . By this point , you 've likely drawn a similarity or five between Facebook 's newest update and a certain picture-sharing app . However , it comes as no surprise , as past tests have made it apparent that the Big Blue F planned to emulate Snapchat 's ephemeral image-posting style . While this is the first time we 've seen these features on Facebook proper , the site 's Messenger app has had its own take on 24-hour snippets for a while now . The Facebook-owned service Instagram has also been using a similar feature for nearly a year now . Facebook 's new snap-swapping features will roll out over the course of this week to both iOS and Android users of the app . For those who already use Snapchat , not every feature has been copied by Facebook just yet , such as its featured Stories from magazines like Cosmopolitan and Esquire .

Facebook Messenger is rolling out Live Location , a feature that lets users share where they are in real-time with one or more friends for up to 60 minutes . By turning on Live Location in Messenger for iOS or Android , whomever you share your location with will see where you are in a map view . They 'll also get an ETA , based on how long it should take someone to arrive at the destination by car . Users can turn off Live Location at any time by selecting Stop Sharing before the 60 ticks time limit is up . To share your location in Messenger on iOS , select the Location icon or More icon , then hit `` Location . '' You 'll see your current location on a map and a blue bar along the bottom to turn on Live Location . To cease broadcasting your position , select Stop Sharing , also located along the bottom of the screen . Facebook says a small clock will let you know how much longer location sharing will be live . Much is the same on Android ; to share your location , select the Location or More icon and choose `` Location . '' The only real difference is the design of the little countdown clock . In addition to Live Location , which is launching globally , Facebook is also keeping the ability to share a static location , great if you 're meeting up with someone at an unfamiliar spot . Instead of selecting Share Live Location , you 'll drop a red pin and can share its coordinates with your friend/s . Live Location comes less than a week after Google Maps rolled out a similar real-time location sharing feature for its users , though Google 's take does n't have a set time length .

Who needs words when you can express yourself in GIF form ? Facebook has finally clued into everyone 's favorite means of expression on the internet , and now will test a new feature that lets users leave GIFs in comments . The concept is as simple as it sounds : as part of the test , users will see a GIF icon when they 're commenting . Click on this , and testers can do a GIF search by typing in a keyword . This will bring up a selection of animated images to leave in response to a post . The feature works much the same as sharing GIFs in Facebook Messenger . “ Everyone loves a good GIF and we know that people want to be able to use them in comments , '' a Facebook spokesperson told us in a statement . `` So we 're about to start testing the ability to add GIFs to comments and we 'll share more when we can , but for now we repeat that this is just a test . ” The test gets underway on Monday and will only be visible to a small percentage of users . The GIFs in comments feature was first reported on by TechCrunch . GIFs have been somewhat of a pariah on Facebook , with the social network only recently letting users share them in the News Feed , but even then , only via links . As TechCrunch suggests , if their presence in comments gains traction , it could not only lead to everyone posting GIFs in comments someday soon , but also perhaps a proliferation of animated images right on the News Feed itself .

Facebook Live is making the big leap from mobile devices to the desktop PC , opening up new possibilities for the famous game streamers who you may already watch on the likes of Twitch . Facebook Live – which , as the name suggests , allows for the direct broadcast of live video footage – has been up and running on mobile since last year , but it now supports screen capture for users on desktop computers and laptops . Of course , you ’ ll need a webcam attached to your PC , or built into your notebook , to be able to use the service . Previously , since at least January of this year , businesses and brands with Facebook Pages have been able to broadcast live video from a desktop machine , but now everyone can . To fire up a livestream , all you need to do is click the red Live Video button which you ’ ll find at the top of your newsfeed , and away you go . It ’ s obviously a much more stationary experience than broadcasting video recorded from a smartphone , but a number of options have been added… Facebook noted that it has added a new feature for those who have dedicated streaming software or external hardware to go live directly from their PC with ease . The social network said : “ With this update , people can seamlessly share their screens , insert graphics , switch cameras , or use professional equipment in Facebook Live videos . ” All this could be useful for gamers trying to make their broadcasts more interesting , and indeed those concocting the likes of how-to guides who can superimpose text and instructions on footage , and so on . Will this cause Twitch to quake in its ( so to speak ) boots ? That remains to be seen , but for now this is definitely a very useful addition for PC users who fancy connecting with a new and potentially huge audience ( Facebook has closing on two billion users worldwide ) .

It 's best known as the world 's largest social network , but Facebook is no stranger to hardware . It owns the Oculus virtual reality platform and has dabbled in phones too , but has always partnered with or purchased a hardware company to get its name alongside physical consumer tech . However , it now seems that Facebook is ready to reveal its own gadgetry beyond the 'Like ' button , with a number of hardware interests waiting in the wings . According to Business Insider sources , the fruits of Facebook 's hardware-focused Building 8 team are to be shown off next month at Facebook 's F8 conference . And the wares could be quite varied and unexpected . Business Insider 's source points most readily at an augmented reality device . Building 8 team lead Regina Dugan , former head of Google 's advanced projects division , has posted online to this effect , speaking of `` hardware advances '' that could allow people to connect when not physically in the same room – suggesting a system that would make it seem your chums or workmates were in the same space as you . There are also whispers surrounding a brain-scanning technology , while new staff hires seem to suggest Facebook is once again looking at drones , perhaps beyond the bounds of its Aquila internet-providing UAV . Finally , there 's also talk of a Facebook-developed medical device in the works , with one team being led by a Stanford cardiologist . With virtual reality headsets like its Rift being critically well received but lacking a huge consumer market , it seems Facebook is ready to expand its interests into spaces more commonly associated with the business sector . This year 's F8 conference could be the greatest insight yet into Zuckerberg 's long-term plans for Facebook as a result .

Privacy is always a touchy aspect of the social media experience , but unauthorized gathering of personal info - especially for use by law enforcement - tends to hit that nerve especially hard . To that end , Facebook and picture-sharing service Instagram , which is owned by Facebook , have reworded their platform policies for third-party developers , making it clear that using personal data for surveillance is banned . `` Our goal is to make our policy explicit , '' says Facebook 's official Privacy Policy page . `` Over the past several months we have taken enforcement action against developers who created and marketed tools meant for surveillance , in violation of our existing policies . '' In case it seemed foggy the first time , Facebook 's new platform policy makes it explicit , asking developers not to use Facebook data to `` provide tools that are used for surveillance '' flat-out . Additionally , a Facebook representative tells us that the site 's platform policy is global - affecting developers from all regions planning to work with the blue-and-white internet giant . Policy updates are a common practice for Facebook , with some other recent changes preventing issues such as discriminatory ads , companies using Facebook data to approve or deny loans , and promoting payday loans to users . However , there may be a more specific inspiration behind Facebook 's latest rewrite , following an instance of law enforcement using Facebook data against the site 's policies to track protesters in the US , according to The Guardian . The social media hub was urged by the American Civil Liberties Union to update its policies following accusations of a third-party social media developer feeding Facebook data to law enforcement officials . This data was reportedly marketed to and used by police to monitor individuals that checked in at protest sites , used hashtags associated with protests , or interacted with activist groups on social media . Facebook and Instagram have since addressed this particular issue , and hope that the more direct wording will ensure a developer `` understands the underlying policy and how to comply '' when it comes to handling your data .

The living room ( or better yet , a lively pub ) is often the primary venue for taking in a soccer match , but your next stint at the pitch may come from a visit to Facebook . The social media giant has teamed up with US-based organization Major League Soccer and Spanish language sports channel Univision Deportes to bring full games from the 2017 MLS season to Facebook Live . Utilizing Facebook 's livestreaming video platform , a minimum of 22 MLS matches airing on Univision networks will also become available in English via the channel 's Facebook page for users in the US , complete with its own set of commentators . MLS & @ UnivisionSports have announced a collaboration with @ facebook to live stream 22+ regular-season matches : https : //t.co/8tJ8dTwvoG pic.twitter.com/Rb1J0YYeNAMarch 10 , 2017 The games will take advantage of Facebook Live 's interactive features and mobile focus , using the platform to conduct live polls , gather Q & A topics from fans , and put up '' interactive graphics '' over the course of the game . Additionally , MLS will air `` Matchday Live '' on its own Facebook page , showing highlights from past games , analyses from experts , and a look at upcoming games in the season . The first MLS match headed to the blue-and-white social media hub starts March 18 at 1pm PT/4pm ET , when Atlanta United squares off against the Chicago Fire . This is n't the first time soccer has found a way onto the bleeding edge of broadcasting . The Premier League , one of the world 's biggest sporting organizations , announced it would air in 4K for DirecTV customers earlier this year .

Update : Facebook announced that its big Messenger update has rolled out globally today and , right on time , we 're seeing version 108 in the App Store . Your Facebook Messenger conversations are about to undergo a big visual upgrade and it even has new features that aren ’ t available on Snapchat just yet . “ Messenger is becoming more real-time and more visual , ” explained Stan Chudnovsky , head of product for Facebook Messenger , who noted that emoji and the in-app camera are outpacing overall text message growth . “ We looked at that and figured , ‘ Why don ’ t we go all the way ? ’ ” Meet the latest Messenger update , which begins rolling out to smartphones today . It ’ s mostly been in the hands of employees and influencers designing stickers , but TechRadar was able to spend an afternoon playing around with the new app at Facebook ’ s Los Angeles office . There ’ s a prominent camera button right inside the otherwise familiar iOS and Android chat app , making it easy to snap a photo or record a video . You can then add the sort of stickers , emoji , text , drawings and special effects that Snapchat has popularized . It ’ s almost all here . Here is what ’ s really different : Facebook Messenger allows you to reverse the order of operations . Start with a “ blank ” canvas by throwing the same art into the camera viewfinder , then snap your photo when every sticker is lined up just how you like it . You can perfectly position yourself behind all of that visual flair in a way that ’ s more efficient and fun than it is on Snapchat right now . Sure , Snap debuted four new features for its app this week , but it doesn ’ t have this one – and it ’ s important . I posed in front of this classically drawn white coffee mug sticker , for example , having already placed it where I wanted it in the camera first . It was much easier to then arrange myself around the perfectly placed mug , and it allowed me to focus on making a stupid face . This is a better way of telling my friends “ I ’ m working today and require coffee this very minute . ” Then I set up another photo by effortlessly ducking my head underneath a bunch of light rays ( no , not stink lines , thanks ) , telling friends I was at Facebook LA today . The Messenger team intended to make these visual messages expressive and fast , and this does just that . Remember AOL Instant Messenger ’ s away messages ? Facebook is bringing that idea back with today ’ s update thanks to its own unique take on expiring visual messages . “ That was how I ’ d look at my buddy list , ” said Peter Martinazzi , Director of Product Management for Facebook Messenger , recalling way too many sad and lyric-filled AIM away messages . “ I ’ d see what my friends were up to at the time , and then I would message them based on that . This was a really big part of the chat experience . ” Today ’ s Messenger update is finally bringing a chat status that ’ s separate from your Facebook status – said to be a long-awaited feature for users – and it too is undergoing a visual retooling . It ’ s called ‘ Your Story ’ and it answers that same ‘ what are you up to ? ’ question by allowing you to string together your visually enhanced messages for your friends to see. ‘ Your Stories ’ expire after 24 hours , just like Snapchat and Instagram ’ s similar ‘ Stories , ’ but this one is meant to be seen by your friends . That ’ s why the AIM away message analogy actually works . In fact , Messenger ’ s version of Stories appear at the top of the main chat menu , but it ’ s mainly populated with people you interact with – not every single friend . Even if you reach Facebook ’ s 5,000 friends limit , the most people that will see ever your stories is 500 . Update : The status message portion of Messenger of the update wo n't launch everywhere right away , but Facebook said it 's rolling out over time . “ It ’ s less about the volume of people , and more about the right people – the ones you ’ re already talking to and those conversations get better , ” noted Martinazzi , explaining how Messenger ’ s Stories are different from those seen on Snapchat . Facebook knows who your friends are more than any other service . ‘ Your Stories ’ is sorted by the friends you interact with on Messenger and , to a smaller extent , Facebook . That ’ s currently a huge advantage for the service over something like Snapchat . There ’ s also the fact that Messenger is a more straightforward chat app with a familiar user interface ( UI ) . In addition to being used by one billion people a month , Messenger is now seeing hundreds of millions of users everyday , according to the Facebook team . Messenger is in more hands and the app design is easier to use for non-millennials . That means it has a better chance of taking snaps mainstream . If I ever intend to pry my parents off of SMS and iMessages , I can introduced them to Messenger . I can ’ t imagine teaching them Snapchat . Not everyone knows why they would want to create a visual message to get their point across , but Facebook ’ s Peter Martinazzi had a great analogy for when it works , likening it to a receiving a personalized birthday card . “ I actually don ’ t buy birthday cards , ” admitted Martinazzi . “ But my aunt still buys me birthday cards and when she does , she could just write me a message that says ‘ Happy Birthday ’ but she goes and picks out the perfect card for me . “ That helps her get her message across , ” said Martinazzi . “ Right now , the way emoji works , it ’ s like giving that blank card . “ With the camera , you can kind of put your name behind it . ”

Facebook has announced its first app made just for virtual reality , though you 'll need a certain kind of headset to take advantage of it . The inventively named Facebook 360 is designed just for Samsung Gear VR . The mobile VR headset , you may recall , was developed in partnership with Oculus . Facebook spent a couple billion dollars to buy Oculus nearly three years ago . The `` 360 '' harkens to another VR area Facebook is keen on promoting : immersive photos and videos . These are at the core of the Facebook 360 experience ; the app will surface 360-degree pictures and vids from your News Feed to your face , among other features . Facebook 's newest app is broken up into four feeds , at least at launch . The first is Explore , which lets you discover interesting and popular 360 content posted to Facebook by media , organizations and `` individual creators '' . The next is Following , which , as the name suggests , shows you 360 photos and videos shared on Facebook by your friends and Pages and people you follow . The Saved feed is a storage locker for 360 content you 've set aside to view later , and the Timeline feed basically lets you relive your own 360 uploads . While not a wholly new feature , you can also react to 360 posts from within the Facebook 360 app as well as throw them on your own feed . Facebook says it will add more social functions soon . To download Facebook 360 , head into the Oculus app from your Gear VR-friendly Samsung device . Do a search for `` Facebook 360 '' or check out the Oculus website , and voilà , you 're ready to dive into a veritable treasure trove of virtual reality content .

When words just are n't enough - or you just do n't have enough time to tap them out - emojis can come to the rescue , and Facebook is reportedly testing out a feature that lets you reply to messages with smiles , sad faces , and even a thumbs down icon . After a reader tip , Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that emoji reactions are indeed being trialled . Most of the reactions are the same as the ones you 'll know from your News Feed , except for that thumbs down , `` dislike '' button , which Facebook says is more of a `` no '' response to something that 's been said . `` We 're always testing ways to make Messenger more fun and engaging , '' Facebook told TechCrunch . `` This is a small test where we enable people to share an emoji that best represents their feelings on a message . '' As with any experiment on the social network , this wo n't appear for everyone until Facebook is sure it works and has got enough positive feedback from testers . It would however make conversations that bit easier to follow , because reactions can be pinned to individual messages inside a thread . If that sounds familiar it 's because there 's a pretty much identical feature available in business messaging tool Slack . Whenever Facebook runs out of ideas of its own it 's never afraid to borrow a few from its competitors . Facebook officially introduced reactions to the News Feed near the end of 2015 to add more variety to the Like button , and it makes sense to have them inside Messenger too , together with instant responses for yes and no . Keep your eyes on the apps on your own phone for a wider roll-out .

Facebook is now so much more than a social network , but of course , you already knew that . At this week 's F8 2017 developer conference , the company that has its fingers in seemingly everything – from virtual reality to internet drones – brought its vision of how it plans to connect us all into focus , though we wo n't see the fruits of this labor for several more years . With few true products unveiled , Facebook spent much of the past two days hammering home its work in augmented and virtual reality , artificial intelligence and connectivity , topics it 's discussed before but never quite with this much purpose . Plus , we got to see the beginnings of Facebook 's own moonshot projects , courtesy of a former Googler . One major area Facebook is now focused on is turning the camera into a mainstream augmented reality platform . Right now , in practice , this means effects and animations to up the fun in your photos and videos , but it 's also a necessary play for Facebook as it looks to stay competitive against Snapchat . It also lets the company lay vital groundwork in the fields of object recognition , location sensing and effects , which could be applied across products and in ways much more useful than putting a puppy mask over your face . CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during his keynote address that while he used to view glasses as the future of AR , it 's the camera he 's now convinced will be the means through which we enhance the real world with digital objects , at least to start . Facebook plans to be a part of , if not the leader in , that evolution . Artificial intelligence is another hugely important area for Facebook , not only as it looks to place the perfect effects over your photos and videos so you share them more frequently , but also as Facebook bolsters its various services , including Messenger with the M digital assistant . The smarter its AI , the better its services meet user needs , and the more time we 'll spend in the Facebook app ecosystem ( which is what Facebook is really after ) . With 1.2 billion monthly users on Messenger , it benefits Facebook to make the platform as savvy as possible . Bots got their own play at F8 : turns out , customer connections with businesses are running healthy , with over two billion conversations taking place between these demographics in just one month , Facebook said . Again , bots are a way to keep users inside the Facebook ecosystem , and Facebook 's VP of messaging products David Marcus went so far as to say Messenger could one day become the Yellow Pages of messaging , serving as a one-stop shop for all your , well , shopping needs . Augmented and virtual reality are key to Facebook 's connected future as well . As noted by Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer , Facebook is one of if not the only company investing in VR across price points and specs . It 's a wise move as customers will come into VR at different entry points , and Facebook can be there to meet them at each one . As for AR , Oculus Research 's Chief Scientist Michael Abrash predicted that in 20-30 years , we wo n't be using smartphones any more , but rather wearing smart glasses that are comfortable , socially acceptable and enhance our hearing and vision . It 's almost certain Facebook will develop the very glasses he 's talking about ( even if Zuckerberg is focused on the camera right now ) , though we likely wo n't see a finished pair for at least another 10 years . Tapping into what it 's learned from Oculus Rift , Samsung Gear VR and newly released applications like Facebook Spaces , the company is well-positioned to do well in AR development . As intriguing as Facebook 's work in these areas and others is , by far the most impressive announcements to come out of Day 2 , and arguably the entire conference , were made by Regina Dugan , head of Facebook 's Building 8 team . Formerly director of the US government 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency who went on to lead Google 's Advanced Technology and Projects division , Dugan now runs Facebook 's product development branch , aka Building 8 . It 's here the most innovative , `` category-defining products '' are developed , and as Dugan described at F8 , the team is focusing a good portion of its attention on our brains . The aim is to create systems that allow us to remain engaged with the physical world while still utilizing technology , letting us staying connected through our devices without having to feel like we need to make a choice between the two . Dugan detailed two remarkable projects currently underway , ones that deal specifically with silent speech communications . The first is a way of letting people type using only their brains . In a video shown on stage , a woman debilitated by ALS typed with only her thoughts . Dugan explained a pea-size electrode implant is in the part of the woman 's brain that would normally control motor functions . The implant records neurons as she imagines moving the cursor , then a computer learns to move the cursor for her . With the system , she can type eight words per minute . Eventually Building 8 and its partners hope to create a system that types 100 words per minute using non-invasive , wearable sensors , which would allow them to be produced and shipped quickly to reach the most people . This is n't mind reading , Dugan explained , or at least not of every thought that courses through your cranium . Rather , Building 8 's system will seed out the words people have decided to share , funnel those to the brain 's speech center and translate those into typed words . `` A silent speech interface , one with all the speed and flexibility of voice , but with the privacy of typed text , '' Dugan said . `` Better yet , with the ability to text a friend without taking out your phone or to send a quick email without missing the party . No more false choices . '' The second Building 8 project Dugan detailed is hearing through skin . Yes , you read that correctly : Facebook wants us to understand words through tactile input . Dugan played a video in which a Facebook electrical engineer with a system of actuators on her arm could feel words in combinations of one , two and three through her skin . She has a tactile vocabulary of nine words , learned in an hour . Dugan described the system as an artificial cochlea , or the part of the ear that lets us pick up sound vibrations and understand speech . `` If we put these two things together , they suggest that one day , not so far away , it may be possible for me to think in Mandarin , and for you to feel it instantly in Spanish , '' she said . `` Imagine the power such a capability would give to the 780 million people around the world who can not read or write , but who can surely think or feel . '' Dugan 's presentation was the highlight of the conference , and drives home that Facebook is much more than a social media service . The company 's ambitions reach far beyond connecting us with posts and pictures , and into the very way we interact with one another .

The biggest product unveiled at Facebook 's annual developer gathering , known as F8 , is Facebook Spaces . It 's a virtual hangout app where you and up to three friends can travel to exotic locations , draw pictures , put silly masks on , and share selfies to post to Facebook . It 's also the most fun I 've ever had in virtual reality . The concept is simple . First , you need an Oculus Rift headset and Oculus Touch controllers . Then you create a virtual avatar of yourself , sync your Facebook account with the Spaces application , and go into a sort-of homebase hang out room with your friends ' avatars . In my case , my virtual tour guide and I were on the boardwalk at a theme park . From there , anyone in the virtual room can grab a floating orb , each containing a different VR experience . Place the orb in the center of the blue table you 're gathered around , and everyone is transported into the experience . This could be a paraglider flight over the Yosemite Valley , a bird's-eye view of Barcelona , a visit to The Shire in New Zealand , or swimming with sharks under the ocean . At your disposal are a set of tools in a panel in front of you , such as pencils that let you doodle in the air , or masks you can put on yourself or your companions . There 's also a selfie stick , natch , which lets you snap selfies within the VR environment to post to Facebook . Everything is controlled through Oculus Touch by grabbing , pointing and pressing virtual objects , the tools on the panel and buttons located on your wrists . For example , if you want to get rid of a doodle you just drew , grab hold of it , turn your wrist over , and press 'Clear ' . If you want to share a selfie to Facebook , you do the same thing , but this time select 'Share ' on your wrist . Every tool and feature ran nearly flawlessly in my demo , and while there was n't anything overly complex , the experience was enjoyable in its simplicity . Even better : for the first time ever , I actually had a connection with another person in virtual reality . I had never met my virtual tour guide before , but by the end of my demo , I felt like I was hanging out with a friend in a virtual playroom and chatroom rolled into one , cheerfully jumping from place to place , having a conversation , drawing , and taking pictures . And if you 've ever wondered what it 'd be like to be a video game , I imagine this is what it feels like . The common refrain is that virtual reality is a solitary experience , which it inherently is . With Facebook Spaces , suddenly there is another person in the same virtual room as me , seeing what I see , interacting with me . This was incredibly satisfying , even if that other person was a cartoony avatar . Person-to-person interaction Spaces is n't , and this early version has its flaws , but this was by far the most connected I 've ever felt in VR . While hanging out with my new pal inside virtual reality was great , the most impressive Facebook Spaces feature is the ability to call a friend who is n't in VR using Facebook Messenger . In my case , I rang up TechRadar 's Senior Mobile Editor Matt Swider , and he was kind enough to take a call from virtual avatar Michelle . The connection was strong , the audio sharp , and I was impressed with the all-around quality of the video and voice feeds . With Matt 's real self coming through in a rectangle frame , I could grab hold of the frame and move it to show him different views of wherever I was . This would be useful if I wanted to show him 360-degree photos from my latest vacation , for example . I could also hold onto Rectangle Matt and take a selfie of us both , then share it to Facebook , which I did . Though I did n't try it in my demo , Oculus representatives said I could receive a Facebook Messenger call inside Spaces , with a notification that someone is calling me popping up on my wrist . Other Facebook alerts will appear here as well , they said . While I had a several minutes ' long conversation with Matt inside Facebook Spaces , visiting exotic locations with him and snapping selfies , my virtual tour guide could n't see or hear him ( though , if I turned Matt in his direction , he could see my guide , and vice versa ) . This makes sense as only I 'm connected with Matt via Facebook , but it definitely raises the issue of being rude to your virtual companions while you have a private conversation with a friend . The calling feature seems best suited for short chats where face-to-face communication is necessary , lest you leave your virtual companions to entertain themselves with doodles for too long . But it 's a great way to bring people who do n't have a virtual reality headset into a VR environment , blurring the lines between the virtual and physical for a practical purpose . All this said , Facebook Spaces is n't perfect . Not that it claims to be ; an early version is on display at F8 , and Facebook will continue to add features as users get a hold of the app via Early Access in the Oculus Store . One issue I raised is that you 're stuck at the blue table in the middle of your Spaces group . You can switch places with someone next to you ( though this may cause a tangle of wires , so be careful ) , but you ca n't all get up and go bobbing around a world together . This may be something Facebook looks to change in the future , and I understand the safety constraints of keeping everyone stationary when wearing a tethered headset , but it feels like the experience could be that much more interactive if your group could explore away from the table . While I can cope with staying still , my biggest problem with the Spaces experience is that you ca n't see yourself . You have no concept of `` you '' except when you take a selfie or look in a mirror tool . The effect is disorienting ; I felt like a bodiless voice at the beginning of my demo , though this sensation lessened the more time I spent in the experience . Of course , no system has mastered bringing your physical body into virtual reality , but in Facebook Spaces the feeling of disembodiment was heightened because of the other avatar 's presence . When I have a conversation with someone in the real world , I 'm aware of what I 'm doing with my hands , my head , my legs , etc . To talk to someone ( well , an avatar of someone ) in virtual reality and not have that same sense of self – to not see my body or have any sense my movements were being mirrored in the virtual world – was disconcerting . This is not necessarily Spaces problem to solve , but perhaps there are cues or reflections Facebook could introduce to help users ( or maybe just me ) feel like I actually still exist . It 's important to note that while Facebook Spaces avatars are more realistic than Oculus Avatars , they have no inherent gender and can be customized with different facial features and hairstyles to help users express their identify . This will hopefully lead to an inclusive environment for anyone who uses Facebook Spaces , and Facebook also tells us it 's listening to feedback on what it can do to help people express their identity in VR . Facebook Spaces as-is feels like a fantastic start to something wonderful . It will only get better as more experiences are introduced and features are added , but if , like me , you felt something has been missing in VR , Spaces could be the social elixir we – and virtual reality – needed all along .
A massive part of Facebook 's long-term plan to `` build community '' is to connect the world with the internet . From routers to drone planes , Facebook has done just about everything to deliver on that promise , but today it introduced one more method . The social network is developing a small helicopter drone called Tether-tenna , designed to deliver internet when infrastructure is damaged or destroyed , such as during a natural disaster . Some infrastructure fiber must still be operational so Tether-tenna has something to connect to . Once tethered , the 'copter will create a virtual tower by soaring a few hundred feet into the sky . Facebook refers to this as `` insta-infrastructure , '' a system that can be rigged in a hurry to restore connectivity to an affected area . `` When completed , this technology will be able to be deployed immediately and operate for months at a time to bring back connectivity in case of an emergency — ensuring the local community can stay connected while the in-ground connectivity is under repair , '' wrote Facebook 's Yael Maguire in a blog post . Facebook 's hope is to have Tether-tenna operate autonomously for long stretches of time , and while the helicopter is still in the early stages , the technology seems to be progressing along nicely . A few years ago , it may have seemed absurd for Facebook to develop a drone plane , let alone a helicopter , to beam down internet , but now it 's par for the course for the social network to experiment with new technologies in its never-ending quest to connect the world . This may the latest , but it certainly wo n't be the last time we hear about Facebook 's internet-delivering ambitions .
Not content with laying out a full-blown augmented reality ( AR ) platform with its new smartphone camera software , Facebook has launched two , brand new 360-degree video cameras to jump start that end of the immersive social media revolution . During Facebook ’ s second and last keynote address at its F8 developer conference in San Jose , California , Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer debuted the new hardware dubbed Surround 360 x24 and x6 . Looking a lot like Nokia ’ s own OZO 360-degree camera , the two sequels sport 24 and six lenses , respectively , in a spherical orientation . Clearly , this is a marked upgrade upon the previous Facebook Surround 360 camera , which simply had a circular band of cameras . Each lens on these cameras can shoot within six degrees of freedom , or 6DoF , and each camera is far more portable and durable than the previous model . This means , according to Facebook , that “ viewers can move up/down , left/right , and forwards/backwards with pitch , yaw and roll inside the experience to see content from different angles . ” Both cameras are said to capture the full RGB color spectrum and use new depth-estimation algorithms through image oversampling – four times and three times oversampling on the x24 and x6 , respectively – to produce better image quality . These improved depth-sensing techniques are said to also afford content creators more impressive 360-degree pieces of video . For instance , live-action video shot with these cameras is supported in existing visual effect editing tools . Because everything in a scene captured by these cameras includes depth information , computer-generated imagery , or CGI , elements can be integrated into live action sequences captured by these cameras . These cameras are clearly designed for content creators , but tease a future in which 360-degree video gets even better , with readier access to 3D effects and allowing for viewers to move around within said video – rather than be the focal point of the camera ( s ) . Designed and prototyped in Facebook ’ s own Area 404 lab with help from FLIR , a specialized computer imaging company , the social network aims to license out its designs to manufacturing partners to kick start its adoption by content creators . Better yet , Facebook also revealed that it has boosted the effective resolution of 360-degree video on its platform when streaming to non-VR and VR devices by 51 % and 59 % , respectively , by using machine learning techniques . These AI techniques predict where viewers will focus on most within a video or be most interested in , devoting the majority of rendered pixels to those areas and at the right times , thus increasing effective resolution . What this all means for you , in the long run , is 360-degree video somehow cooler than it already is – stay tuned to those News Feeds .
If you 're someone who likes to organize lovely runs with chums , but you struggle to let everyone know where to meet and when , Strava is trying to solve that issue . The popular app among cyclists / runners / hikers / canoeists has just added in new functionality allowing users to create events among your clubs . So if you 're a member of one of the world 's greatest running clubs , then you can set up a place to meet , a time and a route if you create it on the desktop ahead of time . It 's pretty simple to set up , and you can choose terrain or the 'level of difficulty ' – beginner , intermediate or advanced – so people know what to expect . If you 're a regular runner of the same routes with pals , you can set it to repeat , and there 's even an option to make it women-only . Once set up the app will email all the members of the group , allowing them to accept straight away , so you 'll have a good idea of numbers . Obviously , this will only work if all members of the real-world group you 're part of are on Strava and part of a pre-defined club within the app , so it might not replace Facebook if you want to be totally inclusive . But if you 've got a bunch of friends who regularly meet up to run , this looks to have simplified things well .

Although Facebook didn ’ t come right out and say it today , it appears as though the wireless , room-scale virtual reality headset you ’ ve been dreaming of might be a reality in the next two years . The headset you ’ ve been wishing for is called the Oculus Santa Cruz headset , and while it ’ s still in prototype form right now , it ’ s coming together quicker than anyone expected . We got our second look at the headset this morning at Facebook ’ s F8 keynote where the company ’ s Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer showed a video of the headset in use to demonstrate how far augmented reality and computer vision have come in the last two years . This sneak peek at Facebook ’ s Santa Cruz prototype was important for two reasons . Not only did it prove that Facebook has made some substantial progress on the prototype but , more importantly , we found out how the headset is going to use computer vision to cut the annoying cable . The technique that Schroepfer spent most of his stage time talking about is called SLAM , or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping , and it allows the headset to use four built-in cameras to detect how the environment around you is changing and mirror that movement in the virtual world . “ This headset doesn ’ t require a cellphone . It doesn ’ t require a PC . No special hardware in your room . You just grab the unit , put it on your head [ and ] you ’ re instantly in VR . Now the thing that actually makes this work is SLAM , ” Schroepfer said . We ’ ve always known that Oculus ’ Santa Cruz prototype needed a way to track your movement in VR using a camera , but we didn ’ t know that it used multiple cameras or the algorithm it used . Schroepfer explained both in detail : “ Because this device has four cameras on it , as I ’ m walking through the real world , those cameras are tracking my movement in the real world and translating those to motions in the virtual world to make sure the virtual world perfectly matches my movements . “ Now , doing this in the VR context is really hard and completely unforgiving . If we get this wrong , your virtual world doesn ’ t update and you break immersion immediately . ” If you ’ ve ever used a headset where something goes wrong , you know that ‘ breaking immersion ’ here , most likely results in some nauseating side effects , so let ’ s hope Facebook can iron that out before Santa Cruz comes to market . As to when that might happen , well , Schroepfer wasn ’ t up for sharing that just yet .
Facebook ’ s goal has always been to bring you closer to your friends , whether that ’ s through products like Messenger or simply by your ever-updating news feed . Now , Facebook is taking that goal of connection one step further by introducing Facebook Spaces to the Oculus Rift Store . Facebook Spaces was a product CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled at Oculus Connect 3 earlier this year ; however , it wasn ’ t until today ’ s F8 conference that we got an extended look at Facebook ’ s “ first social VR product . '' The idea behind the software is to bring you – well , a digital avatar version of you – into virtual reality where you can spend time with friends and family in virtual chat rooms . These chat rooms can be altered in several unique ways like immersing you in a 360-degree video or engulfing you in a different environment like the outer reaches of earth ’ s atmosphere . But before you can start virtual reality video conferencing , you ’ re going to need a digital version of you , or as Facebook keeps referring to them as , an avatar . Here 's a video that should help you visualize how it works : To create an avatar , Facebook pulls a picture of you from your profile and does its best to map the 2D image to a cartoonish 3D figure . From there , you can change your eye color , hairstyle , facial features and more to help people recognize you and hopefully make VR feel more like hanging out in person . Avatars can not only converse with each other , but avatars can also video chat with friends and family members who may not have an Oculus Rift via Facebook Messenger . Call a friend who isn ’ t in VR , and they can answer on their phone to instantly open a window into your virtual world . While the latter scenario is probably the more practical one given the Oculus Rift ’ s relatively slow adoption rate , gathering in virtual reality will allow for more interesting interactions . To that point , Facebook allows you to use a virtual marker to create 3D shapes that you can move in VR – a neat idea in lieu of allowing you to import virtual objects from a library of assets . The technology is only available on Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch , and can be found for free starting today in the early access section in Oculus Store .
Facebook 's annual developer conference is underway , and while we did n't get major announcements in the way of an Oculus Rift 2 virtual reality headset , the social network still swung for the fences with new products and updates to its existing services . Here 's a look at the six most important things Facebook announced during its F8 2017 Day 1 keynote ! By far the biggest actual product Facebook announced is the launch of Facebook Spaces , its first social virtual reality offering . Spaces is essentially a way to hang out with friends in virtual reality . A digital avatar that represents yourself can pal around with friends and family in VR chat rooms . These rooms can be anything from outer space to a locale you 're visiting via 360-degree video . One of the neatest features of Facebook Spaces is that you can bring in friends who are n't in VR using Facebook Messenger video chat . Facebook also lets you create 3D shapes that you can move around in VR , which is pretty damn neat . Users of Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch can start exploring Facebook Spaces today through the early access section in the Oculus Store . The running theme of the F8 2017 keynote was augmented reality and Facebook 's mission to make it the next big platform . Not only that , but Facebook has identified the means through which to make that happen . CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted that while he used to view glasses as the future of AR , he 's since changed his perspective . Now , he wants to `` make the camera the first mainstream augmented reality platform . '' Yes , the camera in your phone or other smart device . To that end , Facebook is launching a number of AR tools for the camera in a closed beta today , collectively called the Camera Effects Platform . Frames Studio is the first product within the platform , and it 's an online creative editor that lets developers make frames for pictures of for any image taken with the Facebook camera . Frames Studio is available globally right now . Then there 's AR Studio , a tool set to help content creators make their own masks , filters , animated frames , and effects , such as a custom celebration overlay for the Manchester United football team . The idea is to make it as painless as possible for developers to create AR effects that respond to the environment , movement and interactions in Live videos , and make those available to users . AR Studio is out now in beta . If all of this sounds like Snapchat to you , you 're right on the money . Facebook is clearly trying to play catch-up to the filter and mask-happy platform , and Zuckerberg even admitted Facebook is late to the AR game . While these features are relatively novel right now , Zuckerberg noted we 're more likely to share photos when they are fun/funny , so this is a smart play to get users posting more content onto the social network , effects and all . It also lays the ground work for more advanced functions down the road , and it 's clear Facebook is n't done developing on the AR front yet . Over 1.2 billion people using Facebook Messenger every month , so of course the chat platform got plenty of play on the F8 stage . Facebook is launching Facebook Messenger Platform 2.0 , infusing its system with even more artificial intelligence to connect users with more businesses and , on the flip side , help businesses connect with more users . Among the additions are a new Discover tab to help users find relevant businesses , such as ones in their area . This is rolling out slowly to people in the US starting today . Parametric codes are also coming , allowing for one bot to tap into multiple codes ( not just QR ) through the Messenger camera . Then there 's Chat Extensions , which allow for more than `` single player and one-to-one chats . '' Extensions allow for multiple people to chat with the same business at the same time . This also allows for sharing of content from a bot with one chat group , such as songs through Spotify and Apple Music . Gameplay in Messenger is also getting a boost through game bots and `` Rich Gameplay , '' which is essentially turn-by-turn games . You can also tap the new Games tab in the Messenger home screen to challenge your friends . This tab is making it to a few select folks in the US starting today . Facebook 's M digital assistant also got a few new features as part of the Messenger revamp . These include making suggestions in your conversations , such as a sticker that reads `` thank you , '' a reminder of an upcoming meeting , or nudging you that you need to pay so-and-so back . M taps into artificial intelligence to recognize people and tasks in your conversations , Facebook says , helping it make smart recommendations based on context . Of course , since 98 % of every conversation revolves around food , this includes helping you make a meal order via delivery.com . The initial response to bots was a tepid one , but it seems they 've since gained momentum , with over two billion conversations taking place between users and businesses in Messenger in one month , Facebook says . Facebook is giving bots even more oomph today , including introducing smart replies that allow Pages to answer the most frequently asked questions using the Wit.ai bot . Businesses can also create multiple parametric QR codes for a single bot , again letting customers use a number of codes through the camera to accomplish a single task , such as paying at a restaurant . Finally , Facebook is now letting businesses to create more than one bot with different developers . So , a business may want to create a personal shopping bot with one developer , then another bot that handles customer service queries with another . Now , businesses are empowered to do this , utilizing multiple bots created by the most appropriate developer to better serve customers . Alright , Facebook did n't announce anything related to its wireless virtual reality headset , but it sure gave us a few good looks during the Day 1 keynote and teased how the headset , which again lacks a PC tether , works . Originally revealed at the Oculus Connect 3 conference in October 2016 , the prototype , called Santa Cruz , was seen in action via video . Yes , this was the same clip also shown at OC3 , but it shows Facebook has n't forgotten about the wireless headset . It appears to be progressing nicely , a good sign for wireless VR hopefuls . What 's more , thanks to Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer , we learned the headset relies on computer vision to cut the cord . Using a technique called Simultaneous Localization and Mapping , or SLAM , the headset 's four built-in cameras can detect how the environment around you changes and mirrors movement in the virtual world . No phone , no PC required . It 's all in the headset , which lets you move around freely with no nauseating effects . How long till we see Santa Cruz in live action , and even more importantly , how long until its on sale ? We ca n't imagine it will be much longer , though an unveiling at Oculus Connect 4 ( presumably in October 2017 ) and holiday release seem the most plausible . Zuckerberg also said Facebook is working on new VR input methods , including hands free . He slipped on some Oculus gloves a few months ago , so while we 'll likely see those mitts before long , it sounds like Facebook is already looking beyond manual controls .
Facebook announced a pledge to make the modern smart device camera what it claims is the first ubiquitous augmented reality ( AR ) platform during its F8 conference in San Jose , California . CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed how the new camera functions will work in Facebook ’ s various apps on the conference stage . Without getting too into the technical jargon , Zuckerberg focused on the possibilities that such technology would bring about – a smart move . However , the Facebook chief did point out the three key ingredients in perfecting its new AR camera functions : precise location , augmented effects and object recognition . “ There ’ s pretty involved AR work to make this all work , ” Zuckerberg said on stage . “ These are the technological foundations for advanced AR . ” Focusing on those core tenets , Zuckerberg went on to describe exactly what AR would entail within Facebook ’ s suite of camera apps . Generally , AR on Facebook will allow you to add three dimensional elements and other special effects to your images and video shared across the social network . These 3D elements could be anything from words digitally placed on top of a table next to a birthday cake to miniature sharks swimming around said cake at a realistic , believable and consistent depth and sense of presence . You can even change the lighting within the scene using the techniques developed by Facebook . Teasing the possibilities for developers that will likely want to make some cash from the AR endeavor , Zuckerberg went on to show how information cards will work within Facebook ’ s AR platform , showing information relevant to a given object or landmark . Want to know what a given store has on sale before even entering ? It would be possible with this tech . Zuckerberg expanded upon this possibility with the idea of Facebook users leaving digital notes tagged to physical places to share with their friends and family , seen through any one of Facebook ’ s camera apps . This could go so far as recommending a new spot for a friend down your favorite street or leaving a note on the fridge for your roommate . Further still , the Facebook chief teased that more interactive functions , like AR gaming and AR art installations , would be coming to the camera platform later this year . Facebook was quick to point out that this kind of technology is already in your pocket , with Facebook recently launching a stickers tool that let users share photos and video with “ stickers ” digitally imposed into the scene . The foundation of this AR camera platform , which launches today in a closed beta , are two apps : AR Studio and Frame Studio . Designed for artists and developers , the tools allow you to create new augmented reality effects with a series of templates and intuitive functions . Imagine being able to create your own Snapchat filters , and you ’ re about there . “ Over time , I think this is a technology that ’ s going to change how we use our phones and , well , all of technology , ” Zuckerberg claimed . To learn more about Facebook ’ s in-beta AR camera platform , check out Facebook ’ s detailed article here .
Facebook today said it will review its reporting procedures after a man in Cleveland posted a video of himself shooting and killing an elderly man on Sunday . `` It was a horrific crime — one that has no place on Facebook , and goes against our policies and everything we stand for , '' wrote VP of Global Operations Justin Osofsky in a blog post . Facebook has faced intense backlash because the video of the murder was on its service for more than two hours before being taken down . Steve Stephens , the suspect who uploaded the video as well as two others related to the murder , is still at large [ Update : Stephens killed himself Tuesday morning after a police pursuit ] . Osofsky detailed the timeline of events , saying the suspect ( he did not identify Stephens by name ) posted one video announcing his intent to commit murder , another two minutes later of the shooting , and a Facebook Live video in which he confessed to the murder . Facebook did not receive a report for the first video , Osofsky said . A report for the second video — which showed the shooting — was not received until an hour and 45 minutes after it was posted . Reports for the Facebook Live video did not come in until the five-minute broadcast had ended . `` We disabled the suspect 's account within 23 minutes of receiving the first report about the murder video , and two hours after receiving a report of any kind , '' Osofsky said . `` But we know we need to do better . '' `` But we know we need to do better . '' According to Facebook 's timeline , the video of the murder was posted at 11:11am PDT . The first report for the video was received at 12:59pm PDT , and the suspect 's account was disabled at 1:22pm PDT , more than two hours after the shooting video was uploaded . In addition to quickening the reporting process , Facebook also plans to examine how it reviews flagged material . Its review process currently relies on thousands of people combing over `` the millions of items that are reported to us every week in more than 40 languages . '' Facebook wants to make this process `` even faster . '' Finally , the social network is looking at the technology it uses to review videos , including artificial intelligence . AI is used to prevent videos from being shared in their entirety , letting users spread awareness or speak out about a video without posting sensitive or graphic content . `` Keeping our global community safe is an important part of our mission , '' Osofsky concluded . `` We are grateful to everyone who reported these videos and other offensive content to us , and to those who are helping us keep Facebook safe every day .

While you 're busy browsing through photos from your friends and liking their opinionated political rantings , Facebook engineers are busy trying to weed out fake accounts and comment spam , and apparently they 're making progress . First Facebook announced it 's making progress in `` protecting the integrity of activity '' on the social network : basically busting fake accounts that are n't connected to real people and stopping people from buying and selling likes or other types of engagement . Facebook says its algorithms are getting better at spotting fake accounts automatically , and that tens of thousands of dodgy profiles were recently removed in France alone . However , Facebook admits it 's an `` ongoing challenge '' to keep on top of the issue . Facebook has also shared news of a six-month battle to stop an extensive spamming scam that flooded the social network with fake likes and comments , one that used advanced techniques to hide the locations where its posts were originating from , and to prevent Facebook from spotting the scale of the operation . `` The apparent intent of the campaign was to deceptively gain new friend connections by liking and interacting primarily with popular publisher Pages on our platform , after which point they would send spam , '' says Facebook . Facebook says a large part of these spam interactions have now been removed , and its detection tools should help it to block such activity in the future . Sadly , there 's still nothing to stop your friends from uploading embarrassing photos of you ...

Most of us visit it at least a half dozen times a day , but how many of us actively enjoy Facebook ? Yes , it ’ s nice to see what ’ s going on in the lives of others and it ’ s always a thrill when the ‘ Likes ’ on something you ’ ve posted start racking up the numbers , but rarely do we end our Facebook sessions feeling happy or fulfilled , no matter how many cute doggo videos we ’ ve been presented with . It turns out that there ’ s a very good reason for this and scientists have proven as we ’ ve long suspected that using Facebook actually makes us sad . A new study by the University of California ’ s Holly Shakya and Nicholas Christakis from Yale has suggested that regular Facebook use actually decreases users ’ happiness levels . That 's not just because Facebook sugarcoats the world , only showing the best of peoples ’ lives and making your own rough days seem worse . It 's apparently also because no matter how many ‘ Likes ’ you get , it ’ s never enough . The research , which tracked 5000 US adults for three years between 2013 and 2015 , compared users ’ Facebook habits against information on their physical and mental health , weight , and general well-being . Worryingly , it found that for every 1 % rise in the number of ‘ Likes ’ , link clicks and status updates a user made , their self-reported mental health dropped by 5-8 % . There ’ s a simple answer to these generally glum findings , however : use Facebook less and have more real world interactions . Looking at how Facebook ’ s impact compares with real world interactions , the study showed that actually meeting friends had the opposite effect , lifting users ’ moods by a similar figure . “ The negative associations of Facebook use were comparable to or greater in magnitude than the positive impact of offline interactions , which suggests a possible trade off between offline and online relationships , ” the study states . “ Our results showed that overall , the use of Facebook was negatively associated with well-being . ” This is far from the first test to link Facebook use with lowering moods . Previously the social network has been link with rising rates of depression . Back in 2014 Facebook was even accused of deliberately manipulating users ’ moods in an experiment that skewed their news feeds with a larger proportion of happy or sad content to see if they would post more positive or negative comments .

You 've been there : you cover the cost of a pizza delivery or movie tickets for friends , then spend the next week trying to get each one to pay you back . Facebook Messenger is today introducing an easy way to send and request money from the whole gang at once : group payments . Now , you can ask everyone in a chat for their portion without having to chase each person down ( there 's always that one friend who really lags , too , right ? ) . Requesting money is relatively straightforward . In the group chat , head to the plus sign located in the bottom left-hand corner . You 'll see a new payments icon , fittingly a ' $ ' sign . Tap this , then select the people you 'd like to request funds from . You can choose to hit up everyone in the group , or just a few individuals . Lucky them . You 'll then input the amount you 'd like each person to chip in , or the total amount so folks can divvy it up among themselves . Name the reason you 're asking your friends for virtual cash , and finally , tap Request . Once the request is sent , a message will pop up in the group chat that lets you see who 's paid and who 's * cough * holding out . At any point you can look at the request in a full-screen view to see all the details . Of course , you can now also send money to someone in a group chat , so the next time you think you scored a free meal thanks to a charitable chum , watch out . A Facebook Messenger request may be coming your way . Facebook Messenger has since 2015 let individuals send payments to one another , so adding group support is the logical evolution of an already convenient feature . Like Venmo , sending payments in Facebook Messenger is free , however Venmo only offers group payments in beta at the moment . This gives Messenger an assured leg up , as well as one more reason you never have to leave the app . And for Facebook , that 's priceless . Group payments are rolling out now to US users .

Facebook has announced the release of an AI assistant known simply as ‘ M ’ for its Messenger app that will pop into your chats and suggest actions it can perform for you depending on what you ’ re talking about . M isn ’ t intended to be an in-your-face and always present assistant . Instead the system will quietly analyze your conversations in real-time and call M to action when you use key-words that trigger its capabilities . At the moment , the actions M is able to take include sending stickers , sending payment requests , initiating apps such as Uber and Lyft , starting polls , sharing your location and formalizing plans . M ’ s actions are optional and its suggestions will pop up in the chat window like any other message , allowing you to either take it up on its suggested actions or disregard them completely . If , for example , you were to be chatting to a friend and one of you mentioned meeting at a certain place and time , M would pop up and offer the ‘ make a plan ’ suggestion . Clicking on this would allow you to set a time and a place for meeting your friend and then M would remind you of your plans an hour before they take place . Or , if someone were to ask you where you are , M would give you the option to share your location . Would you rather they did n't know ? Just swipe the suggestion to the side and forget it was ever made . Facebook has been working on this M feature for a while with testing starting in December of last year . Things have obviously progressed well as Facebook has started rolling it out to iOS and Android users across the US with a global expansion planned eventually . M suggestions is just a part of Facebook ’ s grand plans for bot integration in Messenger . Rather than a standalone bot that you ask to perform specific tasks , however , it ’ s an example of how AI can be weaved almost seamlessly into conversation in order to provide contextual help without the user having to ask or seek it out . If M is perhaps too similar to the annoying paperclip from Microsoft Word for you , however , you will be able to mute it completely or mute certain suggestions it can make in the app ’ s software settings panel .

In an effort to improve the safety and well-being of its users , Facebook is launching new tools to keep revenge porn off of its site . The system works similar to reporting other policy-violating images on the social media service , allowing users to flag intimate images believed to have been shared without the subject 's consent to a Facebook review team . From there , the team assesses if the photo violates Facebook 's community standards , removing it and also disabling the account behind the post if it 's believed not have posted it without permission . The next phase is a lot more tech-heavy , as Facebook uses photo-matching systems to stop further posting or sharing of the image on not just Facebook , but Messenger and Instagram as well . Facebook will inform any user whose image is blocked that it did so on the grounds it violated the site 's policy , with those who genuinely own the photo and consent to its viewing having a chance to make an appeal if there 's been a mistake . Revenge porn , also known as non-consensual pornography , is certainly no small issue for Facebook to tackle . Often shared alongside other compromising details such as a full name or contact information , revenge porn can both devastate a victim 's safety online as well as cause a great deal of real-world harm . A whopping 93 % of individuals claim to have experienced severe emotional distress from their image being shared without permission , with 82 % also reporting significant impairment with work , social interaction , and other important functionality , according to a 2013 study from the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative . For more details about reporting revenge porn on Facebook , as well as advice on what to do in the unfortunate scenario of having your intimate images uploaded without your permission , Facebook offers a resource pamphlet you can read here .

If you want to sell boxes that come pre-loaded with Kodi , you ’ re going to need to find another somewhere other than Facebook Marketplace . The world ’ s largest social network has recently made changes to its commerce policy that prohibit the sale of “ Products or items that facilitate or encourage unauthorized access to digital media. ” In short , that 's anything that runs Kodi . Facebook is following e-commerce giants eBay and Amazon , both of whom prohibited the sale of Kodi-equipped hardware earlier this year . User accounts who have Kodi-equipped hardware listed on the site might now have their accounts banned , but it appears as though Facebook won ’ t be taking any criminal action against anyone hocking streaming hardware . Now , just because you own a Kodi box – a lump term we use to describe any hardware that has the media player built into it – doesn ’ t mean you ’ re a pirate or that you intend to use the software to download and/or watch content that isn ’ t yours . ( Though , one of Kodi ’ s primary functions is to watch channels that you don ’ t pay for – like perhaps a boxing match that ’ s only airing on pay-per-view or an out-of-network sports game . ) However while it has a few nefarious features , Kodi has plenty of legal ( and fantastic ) add-ons – many of which are only there to help facilitate finding content , similar to the Amazon Fire TV or Apple TV . But what Facebook , eBay and Amazon are trying to curb is something called “ plug and play piracy ” , i.e . the ability to buy a box online , connect it to your home network and start streaming or downloading content that you don ’ t have the rights to . What this means is that the software and the hardware falls into a legal grey area : No you can ’ t get in trouble for owning a Kodi box . But you might be subject to investigation , at least in the UK . So what ’ s a streamer to do ? Your safest bet is to stick to standard streaming device like the ones listed above . But , should you want to go the home-brew route by building a Kodi box of your own , just keep clear of content you don ’ t own . Source : Torrent Freak
Tech giants like Google , Facebook and Wikipedia are undertaking a concerted effort to crack down on the dissemination of fake news . While some may cry “ fake news ” to any story they disagree with , fake news is defined by Facebook as “ hoaxes shared by spammers ” for personal and monetary reasons . The term “ fake news ” also encompasses falsehoods disguised to look like legitimate news and overtly biased reporting meant to sway voters during elections . Although fake news has always existed , Google ’ s preeminence in search and Facebook ’ s position as a dominant content distribution platform have changed the way we consume news . In the past , most people got their news from trusted newspapers with clear ethical guidelines that set them apart from dubious sites on the web . Today , users more often consume news shared through social networks as part of a curated feed , often with little vetting , forming an echo chamber effect of confirmation bias . We ’ ve already seen some of the results of proliferating fake news in the 2016 US presidential election and Britain ’ s Brexit vote . Experts found that for both , state-sponsored fake news campaigns attempted to sway voters toward more populist candidates . It ’ s unclear , however , if these efforts had any material effect on election results . The issue of fake news is far from over , but with increased awareness of what constitutes fake news and its potential impacts in the real world , tech companies , journalists and citizens are feeling the pressure to combat its spread . To address fake news , Google announced plans last month to improve the quality and reliability of its search results . This came after the search giant was criticized for showing results for sites denying the Holocaust . One of the methods Google is employing is using human editors to evaluate the quality of search results . The ultimate goal of this effort is to train the company ’ s search algorithms to spot low quality and false content . Another tool Google has adopted is user reporting for its Autocomplete feature , adding another human element into the mix . Users can now report when Autocomplete results are offensive , misleading or false . Google is also working to add reporting features to its Featured Snippets , which are the small blurbs found at the top of search results . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially scoffed at the idea the social network was responsible for the dissemination of fake news that ultimately swayed the US election . But in recent months , Facebook has stepped up its efforts to fight fake news , and Zuckerberg admitted in a post the company has a “ greater responsibility than just building technology that information flows through . ” In December 2016 , Facebook launched new tools for users to report low quality or offensive content as well as fake news . Facebook did n't stop there ; it partnered with third-party fact checking organizations like Snopes , Politifact and the Associated Press to flag stories as disputed . What ’ s more , a warning will pop up when users go to share disputed content with a link to find out why the content is flagged . Facebook also launched a guide for spotting fake news that appeared at the top of users ’ News Feeds . The guide included basic steps and tips on how to vet sources and recognize fake news , but only appeared in 14 countries for “ a few days ” in April . “ When people click on this educational tool at the top of their News Feed , they will see more information and resources in the Facebook Help Center , including tips on how to spot false news , such as checking the URL of the site , investigating the source and looking for other reports on the topic , ” said Adam Mosseri , Facebook ’ s VP of News Feed , in a blog post at the time . While Facebook and Google have launched tools and other initiatives to combat the spread of misleading or false information , Twitter has been relatively silent . The company has a spam policy that bans users for “ repeatedly [ creating ] false or misleading content , ” but not much else in the way of stemming the spread of fake news articles and other misleading content . Twitter declined to comment for our story , and Google did not respond to interview requests . Facebook declined an interview but pointed us to its blog posts on its fake news initiatives . Jimmy Wales , the co-founder of Wikipedia , has also taken up the torch against fake news by launching a new online publication called Wikitribune . Wikitribune aims to pair journalists with volunteer community contributors to cover political topics , science and technology . The site will be funded primarily by donations , like Wikipedia , through crowdfunding campaigns . The hope is Wikitribune will differentiate itself from traditional news organizations by allowing the online community to work with professional reporters to represent facts and offer greater transparency into what goes on in a newsroom . The site 's tagline is : 'Evidence-based journalism ' . With the steps Google and Facebook have taken in recent months , one might wonder if any of them are doing anything to stop fake news . Unfortunately , it appears too early to tell , but the recent election in France gives some hope the measures aren ’ t for naught . Leading up to May 7 ’ s French presidential election , Facebook suspended 30,000 fake accounts that were spreading fake news , spam and misinformation , according to Reuters . Facebook suspended 30,000 fake accounts that were spreading fake news , spam and misinformation Facebook also went old school by taking out full page ads in French newspapers , including Le Monde , L ’ Express , Süddeutsche Zeitung , Der Spiegel and Bild , according to the Washington Post . The ads outlined basic steps to spotting fake news , similar to the guide that briefly appeared at the top of users ’ News Feeds . While Facebook declined to provide numbers for our story , NewsWhip , a company that tracks the spread of stories across social media , found that just 10 % of the top 200 most shared stories surrounding the French election were fake news . This is compared to the nearly 40 % that were deemed fake news leading up to the US election . “ There is a fake news problem without any doubt , but what we like to do is try to quantify how bad that problem is , ” said NewsWhip CEO Paul Quigley in a Bloomberg report earlier this month . While the data from the French election suggests fake news fighting efforts were to some degree effective , misinformation was still widely shared . NewsWhip saw fake news stories claiming Emmanuel Macron , who went on to win the election , was aligned with Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda garner over 100,000 engagements across social media . Macron also filed a legal complaint against newspaper Le Pen for its story falsely reporting he had an offshore bank account . “ It ’ s hard because people have predispositions to liking certain kinds of stories , '' Quigley told Bloomberg , `` and if you have a certain opinion of certain politicians and you ’ re being fed a diet from particular websites that confirms your worldview every day , you ’ re going to want more of that . “ So people are kind of opting into fake news a little bit — it ’ s hard for the platforms , because they are developing algorithms that serve you the stuff you want . ” One argument heard often in the discussion around fake news is the erosion of the US Constitution ’ s First Amendment . The amendment states , in part : “ Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press. “ Other countries like the UK have similar protections , but what the First Amendment means in practice in the US is that citizens are free to express themselves in nearly any way they choose through any medium . Anything that hinders that expression is considered a violation of their rights . However , Sally Lehrman , Director of the Journalism Ethics Program and the Trust Project at Santa Clara University , doesn ’ t think Facebook is violating the First Amendment by policing fake news . “ It ’ s not a question of free speech . [ Facebook ] already makes decisions about what they do and don ’ t show . [ Facebook ] is not the government or an open public square , ” Lehrman tells TechRadar , referring to Facebook ’ s previous removals of the historic ‘ Napalm Girl ’ photo and violent videos . Lehrman is correct in that Facebook already polices the content on its platform . For example , Facebook prohibits nudity and violent imagery , but the social network is constantly reevaluating what content to allow or forbid . In a Facebook document leaked to The Guardian , an example was given of a user ’ s statement describing a grossly violent act against a woman . Although violent and upsetting , Facebook determines something like this is self expression and therefore permissible . Last year , Facebook got into hot water after Gizmodo broke news the social network ’ s human editors routinely suppressed conservative news in the Trending Topics section . This led Facebook to fire its human curators and turn instead to algorithms to simply show what stories were generating buzz . Months later , however , Facebook was forced to redesign the Trending Topics section to combat the proliferation of fake news . And just this week , Facebook redesigned its Trending Topics section once again to show more sources around a single news story . Changes like this have propelled Facebook into the content distribution business rather than simply acting as a social media network . “ Facebook needs to think about its responsibilities [ as a platform ] , ” Paul Niwa , Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Journalism at Emerson College , tells us . “ Are they a content producer or are they a gatekeeper ? ” he poses . ” That is an ethical , not a legal conversation . If they don ’ t adopt these ethical standards , it ’ s going to threaten their business because either the government or the public will take action against Facebook . ” Google is a different beast than Facebook , according to Lehrman . “ Google is different because it ’ s the open web , “ she says . “ The public isn ’ t asking Google to censor [ its results ] but asking it to be more thoughtful about it . ” Tech companies are now in process of holding themselves accountable That ’ s not to say Google couldn ’ t do more to combat fake news . “ I don ’ t see any training in Google News about how to compare information , ” says Niwa , referencing Facebook ’ s tips for spotting fake news . “ Tech companies should be investing in news literacy , ” he continues . While linking to fact checking sites is a good start , Google could do more with being transparent about how it prioritizes results , which can be found in this company blog post but not in the results themselves . After months of launching new tools and initiatives , one thing is clear : tech companies can ’ t fight fake news on their own . The strategies Google and Facebook are employing rely heavily on third-party fact checking organizations , media outlets and the public . “ I think we ’ re all responsible for fake news , ” says Lehrman . “ Journalism and news organizations hold themselves accountable , and tech companies are now in process of holding themselves accountable . ” Niwa notes the public needs to be just as vigilant . “ Citizens have to take a stronger responsibility over what we read and to take an active role about credibility of sources , ” he says . “ This is not something that is too much to ask as Americans used to do this during the penny press era of the 19th century . ” One of the ways Niwa sees journalists , tech companies and citizens working together is in educating the public about vetting their news sources . “ Because of the consolidation of media , Americans have lost a lot of those skills , ” says Niwa . ” Tech companies should be investing in [ teaching ] news literacy . ” Niwa cites the transition from print to broadcast media as another time when fake news ran rampant . “ It took decades for Americans to sort all of that out , and I think we ’ re in the midst of that process . ” While it ’ s easy to point fingers at Facebook and Google as the conduits through which fake news flows , journalists and citizens bear some responsibility as well . The experts we spoke with say journalists must work with tech companies to combat the spread of fake news via fact checking services and by helping to train the algorithms companies ' engines rely on . Citizens , meanwhile , need to take responsibility for vetting sources and thinking twice before sharing news they find . It may be too early to tell if fake news is on the decline and if Google , Facebook , and others ’ efforts are successful in stemming its spread . However , what is clear is that fake news isn ’ t going away unless all parties step up to fight it . “ I ’ m optimistic about the future , ” says Niwa . “ I believe that the more experience users have with the internet , the more likely they are to discuss ideas other than their own . ” Lehrman is equally optimistic about the future of news consumption . “ There ’ s a thirst for news and we see that with [ news ] subscription rates going up , ” she says . “ There ’ s a lot of work to be done , but the bright spot is that we ’ re seeing a lot more news consumption and active engagement . ” Update : The story has been updated to clarify Lehrman 's statements on the First Amendment .
Facebook ’ s original video content is going to have a distinctly millennial feel , if their producing partners are anything to go by . According to Reuters , Facebook is teaming up with Buzzfeed , Vox Media , and Group Nine Media . Vox Media are the parent company of The Verge , and Group Nine Media produce Now This , Thrillist , and The Dodo . All of this information is currently coming from sources that are asking to remain anonymous , so we ’ re still waiting for an official announcement about the content . What we know so far is that the content will apparently fit into a couple of different categories : there will be 20-30 minute shows , and 5-10 minute shows . The new content will be a mix of scripted and unscripted , although what exactly this means is unclear . Following a similar model to YouTube ’ s strategy with original content , the revenue will be driven by adverts . The longer-form content will be owned by Facebook , with the shorter content owned by the media companies , giving Facebook a tasty 45 percent cut of their ad revenue . The social media giant is clearly investing in this land-grab in the lucrative market of streaming video . Apparently it 's paying up to $ 250,000 for the longer form content , and between $ 10,000 and $ 35,000 for the short form content . When we reported on this recently , the rumors were that the shows were going to be released in June . Whether that is still the plan is unclear , but as soon as we know , you will . Via The Verge

Facebook continues to pump up its Live streaming service with new features , and today it 's unveiled two more designed to make broadcasting alongside friends easier , be you audience or host . The first of the new additions to Facebook Live is the ability to chat with friends in a stream , what Facebook is dubbing 'Live Chat With Friends . ' Instead of having your comments lost in a sea of randos shouting over each other , Live Chat With Friends lets you invite folks to a private conversation thread so you can gab about the same live video in peace . The second feature is called 'Live With , ' which lets you notify a friend the next time you go online with your own Facebook Live broadcast . During a stream , you can invite a guest from among your viewers to join in via a picture-in-picture or side-by-side video feed , depending on your device 's camera orientation . Not only does this make a conversation between individuals easier on Facebook Live , but we can see `` calling in '' viewers being a useful addition for hosting seminars , special guest appearances , or events that are prime for audience participation . Right now , the feature appears to be limited to two participants at a time . Facebook is currently testing out Live Chat With Friends and Live With for mobile devices `` in several countries , '' and is expected to roll out both features later this summer .

Warning : Some of the content of this piece may be upsetting or offensive . Freedom of speech is a fundamental right included in the architecture of all civilised societies . The Universal Declaration of Human Rights created in 1948 and signed by 48 members of the United Nations states : “ Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . ” Still , freedom of speech is a contentious issue . In this period of political bipartisanship , where lines are being drawn further and further apart , the right to the freedom of speech is being played as a trump card ( no pun intended ) to allow people to voice beliefs that they know are going to be offensive or upsetting . And to a certain degree , they are right to do so ; that is the reason that the law surrounding the freedom of speech exists . To deal with this issue we are constantly censoring our own experience - either consciously or unconsciously - by deciding the people that we spend time with , the places that we go , who we vote for , what entertainment we consume . Peer groups are invariably drawn together by shared beliefs and experiences . But this doesn ’ t mean something being offensive should preclude it from being part of a conversation . Some of the most important issues politically and socially are offensive . If there were rules that forbade the discussion of offensive issues , that censored life for us , it would feel very much like the dystopian vision of 1984 ’ s ‘ thought police ’ . Censorship has always been a prickly issue . There are undeniably certain things that are inappropriate to be shared because of the audience ; everyone can agree that violent or sexual imagery shouldn ’ t be viewed by children , so it is right to censor entertainment that is likely to be viewed by youngsters . Where censorship becomes difficult is if it infringes on the freedom of expression . If there is a documentary about marriage equality , some people would think that children should also be shielded from it , while others would think that it is essential for children to view . This gray area is difficult enough when the media is something that is being specifically produced for public consumption by a television company . When the populace are the ones creating the content it gets even more difficult . J P Sears ' popular satire about offence This is the situation that Facebook is currently facing . As one of the largest social media platforms in the world , it is now a microcosm of society , and as such it includes all the quirks and foibles of the world . Unlike in offline interactions however , there is a permanence to things shared on the platform – and these posts are easily shared . This raises an interesting issue about whether censorship is appropriate on self expression , and if it is , at what point the line is drawn . To highlight this issue , let ’ s look at one of the more shocking excerpts from Facebook 's recently leaked rulebook on how it attempts to police its network , shared by The Guardian : “ To snap a b * * * h ’ s neck , make sure to apply all your pressure to the middle of her throat ” . This post passes Facebook ’ s guidelines as it doesn ’ t include a direct threat , so is technically a moment of self expression . Now clearly there is a difficult line to draw as the violence included in that post is clearly disturbing , but to remove it would be censorship of personal thought , and then the conversation becomes about the value of thought versus protection from offence . Now there is an argument that the example post above could have been a joke , which further complicates the issue . Obviously , making light of violence against women in a world where the World Health Organisation estimate that : “ 1 in 3 ( 35 % ) women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime , ” could potentially propagate and normalize violence . At the same time , humor is often used as a way to draw attention to an issue , and can be used by survivors to deal with their experiences . So would censorship of this comment be appropriate ? The answer probably lies in context . The problem is that establishing context requires time , and with 1.3 million posts being uploaded every minute , there simply isn ’ t the time for moderators to establish context on every post that gets ‘ flagged ’ as offensive . What makes things more difficult is that not every situation that faces censorship has a context based solution . Take images of abuse for example . In the rulebook there are clear stipulations about when images of animal and child abuse get removed and when they don ’ t . Facebook post from Animal Abusers Exposed , who share animal abuse images and videos to try and catch perpetrators On first hearing this , it ’ s difficult to think of a reason for child abuse to remain on the website , but in the files , Facebook state : “ We allow “ evidence ” of child abuse to be shared on the site to allow for the child to be identified and rescued , but we add protections to shield the audience ” . So then what happens if the child has been rescued ? Does the content stop being seen of as high enough in value ? What is interesting is the stipulations that are placed about when such content would be removed : “ We remove imagery of child abuse if shared with sadism and celebration . ” Clearly context is still at play here , only in the context of the posting not the context of the abuse . If someone is enjoying sharing the abuse , that 's what makes it wrong . What this identifies is that there are users that enjoy sharing , and presumably viewing , abuse . How do you then draw the line in stopping people from enjoying looking at content of abuse , even if it has been posted with good intent ? Does Facebook have to make a decision about the risk versus the worth of people enjoying content they shouldn ’ t ? Where this proves particularly tricky is how it deals with nudity . Clearly , not all nudity is porn , and if there was a blanket ban on nudity , many art pieces , anthropological images , and images of vast cultural significance would be banned . What this does mean is that Facebook has to take a view on when nudity is of a secondary importance in the image . So a picture of a topless woman isn ’ t acceptable , but an image of a topless woman in a concentration camp is , because of its educational importance . According to the files , an iconic picture of the Vietnam war was removed from the site due to the fact that it featured a nude child , leading to new guidelines being drawn up . The Pulitzer Prize winning photo by Nick Ut , commonly referred to as 'Napalm Girl ' But then the obvious question arises , where is a line drawn about what is educational ? If there was a more open conversation about sex , would the previously mentioned abuse statistics be affected ? Is that a conversation that Facebook should be having ? And if it is having that conversation , who gives it that right ? Clearly Facebook has a burden of care for its users , if the site were a total free-for-all , the propagation of extremist groups could go unchecked leading to greater radicalization of young people , it could become a hub for all sorts of illicit and illegal activities . But should the law be the limit of Facebook ’ s remit ? Facebook ’ s greatest blessing is also its greatest curse , that users can find groups of like minded people all over the world . But sometimes those people arguably shouldn ’ t be able to connect . In those situations , is it right for Facebook to intervene , or is it infringing on those user ’ s rights by doing so ? Ultimately , these questions all feed back to a larger question : how do we decide what should and shouldn ’ t be censored ? And from that , are we comfortable with the way our world is being shaped by a company ?
A number of documents and manuals used to train Facebook ’ s moderators have been exposed in an investigative report by The Guardian , revealing the type of content users are and aren ’ t allowed to post on the social networking site . That includes taking some controversial stances . For instance , it ’ s allegedly Facebook policy to allow the livestreaming of video of people attempting self-harm , only removing the video “ once there ’ s no longer an opportunity to help the person … unless [ the videos ] are newsworthy ” . Another example is in relation to violent language , which Facebook only deems as against the rules if the specificity of language makes it seem like it ’ s “ no longer simply an expression of emotion but a transition to a plot or design ” . General statements like “ let ’ s beat up fat kids ” ( a direct quote ) can remain on the site , whereas someone ’ s request for a presidential assassination would be removed . The Guardian report is part of a series the site is calling ‘ Facebook Files ’ – a combination of articles that discuss the guidelines in depth , and also provide samples of the original moderation documents themselves . The guidelines cover a huge range of specific topics , ranging from the showing of animal cruelty to non-sexual child abuse , and detail how Facebook feels each should be addressed . Facebook already has around 4,500 content moderators whose sole job it is to wade through reports from users of disturbing or inappropriate content , and the company has said it plans to hire another 3,000 to help deal with the massive workload . While this army of screening staff deal with these reports , they apparently don ’ t touch any of the content when it first gets posted – that job is instead relegated to automated systems and checks . These issues are obviously ethically complex , and for many people it will be irksome to see these topics discussed through the lens of corporate interest , no matter how reasonable the policy surrounding each problem may be .

Facebook is rolling out the option to order food straight from its app , with no need to open up a separate restaurant page or jump away from the endless scrolling you 're doing through your friends ' vacation and baby photos . The Order Food option appears right on the app or web menu and gives you a direct shortcut to getting fed , although it 's only being tested with a select number of users in the US for the time being . There 's no fixed timescale for it to roll out to everyone , reports TechCrunch . Mark Zuckerberg and his fellow execs wo n't be cooking up your chosen dishes themselves though - the initiative is the result of a partnership between Facebook and food delivery services Delivery.com and Slice . Both those services are US-only so extra partnerships will be needed before this arrives outside the States . The whole process , from picking your food to paying for it , happens inside the Facebook app . You get a map showing the restaurants near your location that support the service , and you can then read reviews , see prices , and get more details before choosing . Once you 've decided how you 're going to satisfy your appetite , a confirmation screen appears showing when your order is likely to be ready . Some restaurants give you the option of a delivery , but in other cases you 'll have to get out of the house and pick it up . The new feature is obviously more convenient for Facebook-addicted users , and Facebook wins because it keeps people inside its app for longer : another step towards Facebook 's goal of replacing every single other app you 've got on your phone .

Just over one year since Facebook first unveiled chatbots , the social network giant is n't done making much-needed improvements to dialog-driven assistants . Today , Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research ( FAIR ) released a new framework for developers intended to help fine-tune and improve the conversational abilities of chatbots , of which Facebook Messenger has over 30,000 as of the end of last year . ParlAI ( pronounced `` parley '' ) is an open-source framework of over 20 different Python-based data sets for training and researching dialog models that power everyday chatbots . FAIR believes that by supplying a unified platform for researchers and developers , chatbots can use the data gathered by the ParlAI community to make chatting with a bot faster and more human-like than , well , robotic . One example of how ParlAI could improve chatbots is its potential to bolster multitasking . By teaching a dialog model to understand more than one sentence at a time , a chatbot can handle more natural conversation instead of short or stilted single commands . ParlAI is n't FAIR 's first pass at improving artificial intelligence , either . The open-source framework joins the likes of FastText , which helps AIs classify text quickly , and CommAI , a general repository for artificial general intelligence , as other Facebook-backed tools designed to put the company on the bleeding edge of AI research .

Not for the first time , Facebook is on a mission to clean up your News Feed - presumably so its billion-plus users will spend more time browsing it and less time posting photos to Instagram and Snapchat . This time the social network 's highly trained algorithms are going after `` low-quality web page experiences '' , so think sites that are stuffed with spammy ads and very little in the way of actual content . Clickbait is in the crosshairs too . `` We 're always working to understand which posts people consider misleading , sensational and spammy so we can show fewer of those and show more informative posts instead , '' Facebook explained in a blog post . The clean-up will affect both standard posts and sponsored content , and is designed to make it harder for spammers to make money off the back of Facebook . The changes are rolling out as of now but make take a month or two to reach you . Facebook 's engineers say they reviewed hundreds of thousands of web pages to get an idea of what spammy sites looked like , then trained an artificial intelligence engine to try and spot these types of links in the future - which hopefully means more quality content in your daily browse through the News Feed . Like much of Facebook , the News Feed is constantly tweaked and refined , but this update sounds like a major one . It 's also notable for the way AI is being deployed to scan a lot more material than mere humans could alone .

A new version of the Opera browser has been unleashed under the codename Reborn , and this major revamp brings forth some neat new features , including integrated messenger chat from a trio of popular apps . Reborn lifts some of the best bits from Opera ’ s concept browser , Neon – which was shown off back at the start of the year – with the primary attraction being built-in chat with support for Facebook Messenger , WhatsApp and Telegram . This feature allows you to pin a messenger window right next to your current open browsing tab , so you have both side-by-side , and can monitor the chat and surf the web simultaneously , as opposed to having to constantly switch between tabs . You can also have multiple chats going at the same time , and cycle between different messaging apps in the pinned chat window at the tap of a keyboard shortcut . The UI has also been worked on , and has a simplified and cleaner look overall , plus some extra touches such as icons that change color when active , and animations for various interface elements . There are also two new color themes – light and dark – and a bunch of new background wallpapers . As you may be aware , Opera is trying all sorts of interesting tricks in an attempt to differentiate itself from rival browsers , and in the past the firm has made moves such as integrating a VPN service and providing built-in ad-blocking . Reborn bolsters the latter feature , giving you more control over blocking options , and making the browser automatically reload the web page whenever you switch ad-blocking on or off . Various other tweaks have been made under the hood , one of which allows for smoother video playback within the browser ( and less battery drain for those on laptops ) . If you ’ re entering a password or other sensitive details , such as a credit card number , Reborn will also warn you that the ‘ login is not secure ’ if the web page you ’ re on isn ’ t HTTPS .

Facebook 's way beyond being just a social network these days , with ongoing projects in virtual reality , artificial intelligence and much more . If reports are to be believed , Mark Zuckerberg 's empire will very soon be expanding into original video shows too . According to Business Insider , Facebook is readying a slate of `` TV-like shows '' that are going to hit the web sometime in June . About two dozen shows are going to feature in the first push of content with more programs following in the future . Apparently we 'll see both big-budget , full-length shows as well as shorter 5-10 minute videos more like the plethora of content already on YouTube . These shorter programs are tipped to refresh every day . The idea is to give Facebook more control over the video on its platform and of course to keep users engaged - in recent years we 've seen Netflix , Hulu , Google , Snapchat and even Apple work on their own original programming to attract more eyeballs . Video ads could also be run alongside the shows . A virtual reality dating show is one of the programs coming your way in June , the report says , with a lot of teen-centric content on the agenda too - apparently Facebook is still obsessed with stealing youngsters away from Snapchat . Sports is another area that Facebook is apparently exploring . All this comes from anonymous people `` familiar with the plans '' that Facebook has , so it 's not official yet , and there are hints that the launch date could be pushed back . Better get all of your binge-watching done now though , just in case .

Facebook has brought its emoji reaction tool to comments , so you can now show someone how you feel about their comment with a simple swipe of the thumb . Originally Facebook only allowed you to add 'Reactions ' to posts but in March it brought the feature to Facebook Messenger , and now you can add little happy or furious faces to comments that people have posted too . Considering the tone of most comments sections , making quick reactions possible does seem a little ill advised , so we 'll be interested to see what affect it has on the Facebook experience . Interestingly , the way that Facebook has calibrated the 'Reactions ' , when you hold down the ‘ Like ’ button and the little emoji bubble pops up , the positive 'Reactions ' appear before the negative ones , potentially quelling the instinct to lazily respond negatively . There has long been a clamor for the inclusion of a ‘ dislike ’ button on Facebook , which the social media platform has resisted . When using 'Reactions ' in Messenger there is a downwards thumb icon , but Facebook insists it is for reacting with ‘ No ’ to something , rather than disliking it . The 'Reactions ' feature on Facebook ’ s main page doesn ’ t include this icon , the only negative 'Reactions ' available are ‘ sad and ‘ angry ’ . By contrast , the possible positive icons you can use are ‘ like ’ , ‘ love ’ , ‘ haha ’ , and ‘ wow ’ . The ability to react to comments is getting a global rollout , but the feature isn ’ t available in all regions just yet . Via Mashable

Facebook has had a number of extremely violent videos posted on its service in recent weeks , and today CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined changes to its review process aimed at making reporting , removing and responding to such videos faster and more effective . `` If we 're going to build a safe community , we need to respond quickly , '' Zuckerberg wrote in a post . `` We 're working to make these videos easier to report so we can take the right action sooner – whether that 's responding quickly when someone needs help or taking a post down . '' The biggest step Facebook is taking is hiring 3,000 more workers for its worldwide operations team . They will join the 4,500 people already employed `` to review the millions of reports we get every week , and improve the process for doing it quickly . '' The reviewers will scrutinize flagged videos , but also content that violates Facebook 's terms , such as hate speech and child exploitation . Part of the team 's job is also to interface with local community groups and law enforcement to respond when someone may be about to harm themselves or is in danger because of someone else . Technology will also play a key role in Facebook 's efforts to remove graphic or offensive content and intervene when appropriate . `` In addition to investing in more people , we 're also building better tools to keep our community safe , '' Zuckerberg wrote . `` We ’ re going to make it simpler to report problems to us , faster for our reviewers to determine which posts violate our standards and easier for them to contact law enforcement if someone needs help , '' he continued . `` As these become available they should help make our community safer . '' One tool Facebook already utilizes is artificial intelligence , which prevents videos from being shared in their entirety . This lets users share videos to spread awareness or speak out , but prevents the sharing of graphic or sensitive content . Facebook faced backlash last month after a man in Cleveland posted a video of himself shooting and killing another man that was viewable on the service for more than two hours . The company said it did not receive a report about the video until an hour and 45 minutes after it was posted . Following the incident , Facebook said `` we know we need to do better '' in reviewing and removing violent content . Monitoring Live video has been especially challenging for Facebook as events are unfolding in real-time . While the company wants to encourage users to go Live and share experiences with their friends and followers , some users have also posted videos of themselves committing crimes and harming themselves and others . How effective Facebook 's new efforts will be remains to be seen . While the company is taking steps to curb violent videos , with nearly two billion users and millions of hours of video posted every day , a 7,500-person team likely wo n't be able to review and remove flagged content at the speed Facebook aspires to . Still , Facebook is willing to try , and is ready to make more changes as appropriate . In response to Zuckerberg 's post , Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg commented : `` Keeping people safe is our top priority . We wo n't stop until we get it right . ''

Just over five months since an initial debut in select regions , Facebook Messenger 's suite of built-in games is going global . In addition to rolling out worldwide , Facebook Messenger 's Instant Games are also getting beefed-up features and more specialized `` Game bots '' that allow developers to make the most of games designed for the originally chat-focused app . Using these new features , Messenger 's games can now incorporate leaderboards and tournaments to help cement bragging rights , as well as allow for turn-based games for those times you can only dip in periodically throughout the day . The first new game to take advantage of these features is Zynga 's Words With Friends , letting Facebook Messenger 's one billion-plus user base play the extremely popular , albeit eight-years old , Scrabble-style game without leaving the app . Also being added is Miniclip 's 8 Ball Pool , which is expected to come to mobile devices `` very soon '' for those looking to do a little billiards with family or friends during their lunch break or commute . The boosted version of Instant Games on Facebook Messenger rolls out today for both iOS and Android , and is expected to complete its expansion within `` the next few weeks . ''
Facebook is trying to bring offline benefits to living a life online by testing out a new rewards feature . The feature will see users get access to a personalized QR code which can be scanned in certain shops to get access to discounts and bonuses . The feature , which was spotted by TechCrunch , isn ’ t available to all users just yet but is appearing for some under the More section of the Facebook mobile app . According to Facebook , Rewards is intended to allow businesses to directly connect with customers . What kind of discounts and bonuses the scheme is offering isn ’ t clear just yet but it ’ s something that could certainly benefit Facebook , its users , and companies that use the social network to reach prospective customers . Simply by virtue of having a Facebook account , users could get discounts in their favorite stores ; merchants would have a way of attracting new and repeat customers to physically visit their outlets ( something that ’ s particularly important with the rise of online shopping ) ; and should it prove successful Facebook would have more evidence that it ’ s a powerful method of advertising that drives purchases and the additional data would greatly improve its ad targeting . As the QR codes are personalized , it suggests that Facebook Rewards will act as more of a repeated use loyalty scheme than a one off discount service . Facebook already has its Offers feature as a means of giving one-off discounts but this could be a method of encouraging repeat custom . We imagine it has the potential to work with hundreds of brands , rewarding customers who shop with affiliated brands with points that can be redeemed for discounts . For example , Facebook Rewards users would be able to scan their personal QR code every time they shop with an affiliated brands , building up points for rewards , and could then be targeted via their Newsfeed with further offers that are relevant to their offline purchases and perhaps accessible only to them . As it wouldn ’ t have any kind of separate app , account , or physical card to keep track of , Facebook Rewards has the potential to attract a wider base of users purely because it ’ s much more convenient . At the moment , though , Rewards is only being tested by a small numbers of users and there 's no guarantee that it 'll ever be rolled out further .

Facebook 's internet-beaming autonomous drone Aquila has completed a successful second full-scale test flight , the company announced today . While the solar-powered aircraft , designed to fly non-stop for 60-90 days at high altitudes , flew once before , the first flight ended in a crash landing . This time , Aquila `` landed perfectly . '' This second flight took place on May 22 and lasted one hour and 46 minutes . The team constructed a special landing area for Aquila , and having made adjustments including adding wing spoilers , modifying the craft 's autopilot software and locking the propellers horizontally before landing , were able to pull off a smooth landing . This is especially impressive because the lightweight Aquila , which has a wingspan wider than a Boeing 737 , lacks traditional landing gear ; it basically lands on pads made of Kevlar as it skids to a halt . According to Facebook , everything except the propeller locking function worked as it should have . One standout stat is that Aquila 's climb rate was almost twice as fast as the first flight at 180 feet per minute , attributable to the changes Facebook implemented . Facebook did n't provide a peak altitude , but said the craft reached at least 3,000 feet before continuing to climb . There 's still more work to be done before Aquila is beaming internet to remote parts of the world , but this is a huge step forward for Facebook in its quest to connect everyone . The social network turned all-encompassing tech company has forged ahead with its plans to deliver internet connectivity to more people , which is part of its newly revised mission statement to build community and bring the world closer together . Aquila 's flight is an important milestone for these kinds of drone aircraft , and an even bigger one for Facebook .
Facebook Messenger is in an interesting stage of its existence , in the same week it launched a collection of fun Snapchat-style video add-ons , and Discover , where you can find and communicate with businesses , often through chatbots . It makes sense for Messenger to be integrating businesses , as currently there doesn ’ t seem to be a way for Facebook to monetize the platform . Our question is : is there room for both things to exist on the same platform ? We were invited to a roundtable with David Marcus , head of Messenger for Facebook where we were able to discuss this with him . “ The experience [ of talking to chatbots ] works , it ’ s just the term is not compelling to consumers . You ’ d be hard pressed , even in the Discover surface of Messenger to find the term ‘ bot ’ because people want to interact with brands , with services , but not with bots , because they don ’ t know what that is . ” But we ’ re not sure we agree . We don ’ t think that people don ’ t want to talk to bots because they don ’ t know what they are ; we think people don ’ t want to talk to bots because they aren ’ t yet developed enough that you can communicate with them naturally . Which makes the hiding of all references to bots feel a little suspect . Marcus was reticent to discuss exact numbers of users that are interacting with bots on Messenger , but he did tell us : “ There are about 2 billion messages a month exchanged between businesses/services on Messenger . That number has doubled in a year , and that includes automation and human interaction . ” Clearly with the amount of interaction increasing at that rapid pace , there is a demand for someone ( or something ) to be handling that demand . And possibly a chatbot is the best way to go about it . The problem is , we ’ re a long way from your standard brand bot in Messenger passing the Turing test . And what this means is that Messenger is in a place where you have dry , unnatural conversations with an corporate chatbot at the same time as a frivolous video chat with your friends wearing a digital rabbit mask . Marcus thinks that this disparity is not a problem : “ I think this notion that people want to be serious on some platforms and fun on other platforms is pretty antiquated . You want to communicate . And of course , when you want to communicate with your bank , you ’ re not going to send them a pic of yourself with a rabbit mask . ” “ The same way that you as a person can walk in a bank branch and be very serious and have a conversation , ” Marcus continued , “ and then go to the pub and goof around with friends . You ’ re still the same person , you just interact differently in different situations . We think the same is true in your digital life . ” And to a certain extent he ’ s right . In a browser window you can go from online banking to trawling Reddit with the click of a button , but that feels different somehow . Perhaps it ’ s to do with branding . Messenger feels like a tool , and if you can ’ t tell if a tool is a hammer or a whisk , are you going to use it for either function ? This isn ’ t the first time that a company has tried to bridge the gap between fun and financial ; Blackberry ’ s Messenger BBM tries to tread this line , and it has never fully managed to make it work while gaining the popularity of Messenger of WhatsApp . Facebook does manage to be sprawling enough as a platform that it can handle a diverse range of content , so perhaps it is the best company to try and make this diverse Messenger work . Discover has only just launched in the US , and will be launching worldwide in the not-too distant future , so we probably have a little while to wait before we can get an accurate gauge of how successful it is .

Facebook announced today it 's reached a major milestone : it now has 2 billion monthly users . The social network was on the cusp of the double-billion mark for several months , and today CEO Mark Zuckerberg made it official in - what else - a Facebook post . `` As of this morning , the Facebook community is now officially 2 billion people ! '' he wrote . `` We 're making progress connecting the world , and now let 's bring the world closer together . It 's an honor to be on this journey with you . '' To put the figure in perspective , Earth 's entire population is 7.3 billion . Twitter has 313 million monthly users , while Instagram , which is owned by Facebook , has 700 million . WhatsApp , another Facebook property , counts over 1 billion users on its platform . And a little factoid dug up by TechRadar Senior Mobile & Buying Guides Editor Matt Swider : If this were 1927 , 100 % of the world 's population would have Facebook . Facebook was launched in 2004 and since then it 's been on a meteoric rise that not only encompasses 2 billion users around the globe but also different products . These include the aforementioned social and chat platforms as well as the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and various internet connectivity projects . Zuckerberg last week announced Facebook has revised its mission statement , centering the company 's focus on building community . Whereas before its mission statement had to do with sharing and connecting , it now reads `` give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together . '' Building community and bringing the world closer together goes further than helping people communicate with one another . Rather , Zuckerberg 's vision is for Facebook to be a platform for people to unite around things they care about . It 's a lofty goal , and Facebook is still a company that must make money , which it does largely through advertising dollars . It may be cynical , but by connecting people through various communities , Facebook can also serve advertisements to these groups more readily . Getting to the next 2 billion users will be a different type of challenge for Facebook . Most of the internet-connected world knows about Facebook already , so the company will have to deliver internet to more remote places with less infrastructure and less robust technology . ( This is where Facebook projects like internet beaming drone airplanes come in , by the way . ) Still , it took Facebook five years to go from 1 billion to 2 billion , and the firm is actively developing new ways for users to connect not just on the platform , but the web at large . And with Zuckerberg already stating he wants 5 billion people on Facebook by 2030 , the next two may be closer than we think .

It used to be so simple for HBO and the other TV networks . They had a monopoly on scripted television as there was nowhere else TV writers could go to sell their wares . Then Netflix came along , Amazon soon after and Apple and YouTube have also planted their flags . Now it 's Facebook 's turn to eye up TV programming in a big way . In a new report by the Wall Street Journal , Facebook 's big TV plans have become a little clearer and we will start to see original programming from the social giant next summer . And not just bite-size , snackable content either but fully fledged television shows . Given this is Facebook , the budget for these shows is huge as well . It 's said that up to $ 3 million will be paid for single episodes and its programming will include everything from scripted drama to reality TV . Demographic-wise , it 's pretty obvious that Facebook is going for a younger crowd , aiming for shows that will please 17-30 year olds . In a comment to The Verge , Facebook confirmed it was working on self-funded TV shows but played down how big it was going , explaining : “ We 're supporting a small group of partners and creators as they experiment with the kinds of shows you can build a community around - from sports to comedy to reality to gaming . ” These new shows are set to go alongside a number of TV series that Facebook has n't created itself but will house on its platform . They include the Sundance hit Strangers and reality show Last State Standing . If the reports are correct then we will see some of these new shows later this summer .

Facebook has updated its mission statement to reflect Mark Zuckerberg ’ s wish for the social media platform to be a revolutionary force for good . At Facebook ’ s first ever Community Summit , Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a speech where he outlined his wish for Facebook to be a driver in unifying communities and tackling big issues . To reflect how serious he is about this desire , he is changing Facebook ’ s mission statement . Facebook ’ s mission statement used to be : “ to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected , ” but is now : “ give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together ” . It may seem fairly grand , but as Zuckerberg said : “ I used to think that if we just gave people a voice and helped them connect , that would make the world better by itself . In many ways it has . But our society is still divided . Now I believe we have a responsibility to do even more . It 's not enough to simply connect the world , we must also work to bring the world closer together . ” It does raise the question about the role that social media can have in the shaping of our society . Without doubt , the adoption of social media worldwide has allowed for people to connect with people that they otherwise wouldn ’ t have been able to , but for the most part , the majority of people that you interact with on social media are people that you already know or celebrities . What Zuckerberg is talking about is truly creating a global community where people are united by things that they are passionate about , rather than because of their geography . He refers to these groups as “ Meaningful Communities ” . The type of group that you would be part of on Facebook that has a deep impact on your life . His speech was peppered with examples , from groups for people suffering from diseases , to black fathers , to a secret group for women in Nigeria to be able to talk about a range of issues that they wouldn ’ t have been able to talk about in real life . This feels like a far cry from the kinds of groups that most of us are involved in on Facebook , but this is something that Zuckerberg is acutely aware of : “ We found more than 100 million people are members of what they call 'meaningful communities ... ' So I started asking the question : if 2 billion people use Facebook , then how come we 've only helped 100 million of them join meaningful communities ? ” This could be in part because not all of us have the need for a community like the ones that Zuckerberg references , or it could be that we aren ’ t searching out these groups , or having them suggested to us . If his speech is anything to go by , it seems it could well be the latter : “ We started a project to see if we could get better at suggesting groups that will be meaningful to you . We started building artificial intelligence to do this . And it works ! In the first six months , we helped 50 % more people join meaningful communities . ” It will be interesting to see if this change in direction makes for a shift in the way people use the popular social media platform . As with anything , the changes will probably seem small at first , but Zuckerberg has his sights set on big targets : “ In the next generation , our greatest opportunities and challenges we can only take on together - ending poverty , curing disease , stopping climate change , spreading freedom and tolerance , stopping terrorism . ” His goals may sound lofty , and it ’ s always worth viewing the goals of a corporation with a touch of scepticism , but if he achieves even half of what he is setting out to achieve here , we welcome the changes . If you want to read his whole speech , you can link to it below :

Facebook is testing a new feature that protects your profile picture , the most public part of your account . The new feature means that people will no longer be able to download , share , or send your profile picture in a message on Facebook . It will also mean that people who you aren ’ t friends with won ’ t be able to tag people in your profile photo , and most impressively it will stop people from taking a screenshot of your profile picture , although this feature currently only works on Android phones . Facebook ’ s security settings are fairly robust , but at present there 's a certain amount of public information that anyone can see , and this includes your profile photo . The abuse of this information is more widespread than you might think . According to Marc Goodman ’ s book Future Crimes , there are 600,000 Facebook accounts hacked per day . One of the ways that people can gain access to your personal information is by ‘ cloning ’ accounts . The perpetrator takes all the publicly available information on an account ( including your profile picture and name ) and then creates a new account , adding the friends of the original account and gaining access to all of their information that is ‘ friends only ’ . Your Facebook profile may seem like a fairly innocuous thing for someone to gain access to , but given that your account usually has where you work , your date of birth , and your full name , it makes identity theft a lot easier . Also , things that are typically used as password reminders like your mother ’ s maiden name , your pet ’ s name , or the school you went to are usually part of your account , making your other accounts vulnerable too . All of this is without mentioning catfishing , the technique whereby someone creates a false identity using your pictures so that they can create a relationship online , usually with someone that they wouldn ’ t ( or shouldn ’ t ) have a relationship with . Protecting profile pictures is a really good step to preventing these abuses , and so we welcome the trial . At present , it 's only running in India , but Facebook has said : “ we hope to expand to other countries soon ” . When it starts expanding to other countries we 'll let you know . Via TechCrunch

Facebook has faced increased scrutiny this past year over how it handles issues such as user privacy , violent content and terrorist propaganda . With the scrutiny has come questions about the role Facebook plays in society , the responsibilities it has , and what changes it can make to be a safer space for users . To provide more transparency about why Facebook makes the choices it does concerning some of the toughest challenges of our time , the social network , which is closing in on two billion users worldwide , has launched a new initiative called Hard Questions . Vice President for Public Policy and Communications Elliot Schrage writes in a blog post that as part of the initiative , Facebook will open up about a variety of `` complex subjects '' . This means explaining its decision-making in these areas as well as exploring the questions they stir up . Examples of the kinds of questions Facebook will address include how online platforms should prevent terrorists from spreading propaganda online , what should happen to a person 's online identity after they die , who decides what 's controversial content or what 's deemed fake news , and how users of all ages can participate in social media in a safe way . These are , indeed , hard questions , and Schrage says `` sometimes we get it wrong '' in the choices it makes . The aim with the Hard Questions initiative is to at least give users a better understanding of how Facebook came to its decisions , and show it 's taking these issues seriously . Facebook is inviting users to submit ideas on topics to discuss , as well as suggestions on what it can improve upon . If you have ideas or suggestions , send them to hardquestions @ fb.com . Facebook 's first Hard Questions post went up shortly after its announcement and discusses how the company counters terrorism online . Recent terrorist attacks have led some to call for tech companies , including Facebook , Google and Twitter , to do more to prevent terrorists from spreading propaganda through their channels . `` Our stance is simple : There 's no place on Facebook for terrorism , '' state Monika Bickert , director of global policy management , and Brian Fishman , counterterrorism policy manager , in today 's post . Facebook uses a number of strategies to identify , remove and report terrorists and terrorist posts , they explain , including artificial intelligence . Some of the `` cutting edge techniques '' Facebook uses include image matching , language understanding , identifying terrorist clusters , detecting new fake accounts created by repeat offenders , and more closely sharing data between Facebook , WhatsApp and Instagram to quickly and effectively act against terrorists and terrorist posts . Facebook is also working with other companies , including Microsoft , Twitter and YouTube , to identify content that 's produced by or supports terrorist organizations . Humans play an important role in Facebook 's counter terrorism efforts , Bickert and Fishman write . A staff that will grow by 3,000 over the next year works around the clock to review user-reported content , and Facebook employs more than 150 people from a wide range of relevant professional backgrounds who work exclusively or primarily on combating terrorism . These are some of the efforts Facebook has undertaken to fight terrorism , and the tools and techniques the company uses are only likely to improve over time . `` We are absolutely committed to keeping terrorism off our platform , '' write Bickert and Fishman , `` and we ’ ll continue to share more about this work as it develops in the future .

Facebook is down . We repeat : Facebook is down . Some users are struggling to get on the social networking site right now and are greeted with a message suggesting none of their friends have posted recently . The issue shows a message stating `` No posts to show '' , but it seems to only be affecting the browser version of Facebook and not the mobile apps . It 's currently unclear who exactly is affected by the outage , but users in Australia are reporting the issue and the site seems to still be working in the UK . This is a bug we have seen before on the social networking site , but it 's not currently clear why it 's happening right now . TechRadar has asked Facebook who is affected and whether the site will be fixed soon . We 'll update this story as soon as we get a response .
Update 2 ( 14 June 2017 ) : Has Facebook suffered another `` No posts to show '' outage ? Numerous reports have come in from across the globe suggesting some Facebook users ca n't see any posts in their news feeds . We 've asked Facebook for information on what 's happening at the moment , and we 'll be sure to update this new story when we hear back . This mirrors an earlier problem Facebook faced a number of years ago , the details of which you can find below . For more on Facebook 's current outage , click here . Update 1 ( 2013 ) : Facebook responded to TechRadar , confirming that there was a `` No posts to show '' glitch today . `` A small number of people had trouble loading News Feed content earlier today . The issue is resolved , and we apologize for any inconvenience , '' a Facebook spokesperson told us . The company did n't give a reason for the error , which means the solution was one of `` wait and see , '' meaning if this happens again , it 's best to hold tight . `` Keep Calm and F5 . '' Original article : A Facebook bug that claims that there are `` No posts to show '' on a lot of newsfeeds is making the Friday night of some users seem like they are leading boring lives . The blank newsfeed glitch displays the `` No posts '' message along with a somewhat insulting `` Find Friends '' button , whether they have 100 friends or 1,000 `` friends . '' This error message has confused a number of users of the social network , who have taken to Twitter to express their frustration and confusion . `` Facebook has broken . Says there are no posts to show and wants me to find friends . This is sadder than it should be right [ now ] , '' tweeted Darkbander . So far , it appears to only be affecting users of the desktop web version of Facebook , with smartphone and tablets apps able to access the normal newsfeed . The complains extend to Facebook 's own troubleshooting pages , where users have n't been able to find a solution to the glitch . What 's interesting is that some of the troubleshooting threads were created up to six months ago , meaning this bug has reared its ugly , unpopular-feeling head before . The threads have been filled with a deluge of new posts from the last several hours , with users asking for tips on how to remedy the situation and fearing that their posts have been wiped clean . `` When I go to see my newsfeed , it says that there are no posts to display , then suggests I find friends . '' wrote frustrated Facebook user Kristen Fraser on the support forums . `` I , of course , have friends . All my groups can be accessed . Chats can be accessed . Friends can be accessed . Just not my news feed . '' We contacted Facebook hoping to hear back about a reason for the new `` No posts '' error message and a possible solution . We 'll update this story when the company responds .

When Mark Zuckerberg bought Oculus in 2014 and declared that virtual reality was going to be a social platform , we ca n't pretend we did n't take part in a collective scoff . Back then ( three years is a long time in tech ) VR seemed like the most isolated digital experience it was possible to have – block your eyes , put on your headphones and enter a virtual world separate from the one everyone else around you is living in . Adding to our skepticism was the fact that virtual reality ’ s best chance at achieving mainstream success as a platform seemed to be through reaching a gaming audience . Having closely watched the development of VR over the years and now having tried Facebook ’ s Spaces for ourselves we have to admit that our scoff was slightly presumptive . It is , you understand , hard not to be immediately cynical about these things on paper - and it is n't until you 've tried it that your perspective shifts . It was strange to stand in a room with someone and pull on a VR headset with the intention of communicating with them but the beauty of Facebook Spaces is , of course , that you ’ re unlikely to be able to be in the same room with the people you ’ re trying to communicate with . Once logged into a Facebook profile , you 're able to create an avatar that 's then tied to your Facebook Spaces account . You can either create the cartoon version of you completely from scratch or select one of your previous profile pictures to quickly generate an avatar that bears a resemblance to you . We went for the quick option and were pleasantly surprised by how close the resemblance was . From there we were able to make small alterations to accessories and clothing colors . Once you ’ re happy with what you look like your avatar is then dropped into a room with a round table at the center . Though it 's an innovative idea and the Oculus headset is a high-end VR experience , the thing that Facebook Spaces truly has going for it is the Oculus Touch controllers . These controllers are some of the best in the virtual reality market and their easy-to-use and intuitive design gives Facebook Spaces more depth than it might have otherwise . Being able to move individual fingers and point to press buttons in your virtual world really adds to how immersed and in control you feel . There ’ s no point in having a bunch of fun features if they ’ re an absolute nightmare to learn and use , particularly when you ’ re trying to reach an audience as technologically diverse as Facebook is . Speaking of fun features , in Facebook Spaces you ’ re pretty limited in what you can do at the moment but there are plans to expand the experience once it ’ s left Beta and users are more familiar with what Facebook is trying to achieve . Right now users are able to float around a table together , talk , draw interactive doodles , take selfies , live stream directly to Facebook , and share content with one another that 's both personal and public . For example , in the room we were able to pull up a console on the virtual table and access a host of publicly available 360 degree photos and videos as well as those we 'd posted on our personal Facebook timeline . Scrolling through them , we selected a relaxing looking beach hut in Maldives that was certainly not a personal capture . The video we selected then became an orb that we were able to hold and when we placed it in the center of the table it essentially cast out around us and became our location . We were able to take out a selfie stick from the tools console and snap a photo from our holiday destination and then share it directly to our Facebook profile . Though Facebook Spaces allows you to bring real-world items into a virtual world , it also lets you share moments from the virtual world in the real one . It 's a two-way channel that greatly adds to the experience . Taking out a pencil tool , we were able to scribble anything we wanted in any color in the air around us . Once you ’ ve drawn something it hangs in front of you and you can pick it up and use it as a wearable item in one of your selfies or simply as a decoration . Though Facebook Spaces takes a simple approach at the moment , it ’ s one that has the potential to be successful because of this simplicity . When we spoke the head of Facebook 's Social VR team , Rachel Franklin , she told us this streamlined approach is a very deliberate attempt to not turn people away . “ I believe that VR has so many opportunities . It ’ s fantastic for gaming but I think that ’ s just one amazing aspect . As Facebook we fundamentally believe there ’ s something incredibly social about being with someone else in VR . We believe this is something that people can do and find meaning in . `` We ’ re aiming to have people believe that VR is for them . This isn ’ t a technology that ’ s for somebody else or some kind of niche group , but for everybody . A technology that looks fun and welcoming . `` The tone of what we ’ re building , the playfulness , these are all really important in trying to make everybody feel like VR is for them . ” As Facebook we fundamentally believe there ’ s something incredibly social about being with someone else in VR . We believe this is something that people can do and find meaning in As much as gaming experiences have a widespread appeal , having a meaningful way to communicate with the ones we love probably has an even wider appeal . This idea of making people feel like VR is for them extends to allowing them to access Facebook Spaces without the need for a VR headset at all . If you ’ re in Facebook Spaces using VR and you have a family member you ’ d like to contact that doesn ’ t have a VR headset you can still call them from within your headset and video chat with them . Facebook Spaces is open to users regardless of whether they have a headset or not but it ’ s easy to see why having a headset is the most appealing way to use it . It ’ s this openness to everyone that ’ s likely to draw more people into the idea of purchasing a headset rather than put them off it . Sure , you don ’ t need a headset but if you want to feel like you ’ re entering this world with your friends rather than looking in through a window on your phone , you might be convinced to get one . It ’ s the best possible way to show people what they ’ re missing , as it were . Even though gamers can play the same games across several headsets , they still need a headset to see what the platform is capable of . Facebook Spaces gives an insight into the fun without requiring that you test a headset out for yourself . I don ’ t think you ’ re ever going to be able to replace physically being with a person you care about At first putting a headset on and creating an avatar seems like an awful lot of effort to go to when you can send a simple text or make a phone call . But when we asked Franklin about how Facebook plans to draw people in when there are simpler forms of communication already available she replied that it ’ s all about context . “ I don ’ t think you ’ re ever going to be able to replace physically being with a person you care about [ ... ] I think there ’ s just different forms of communication . Text communication is appropriate for some situations , but we ’ re trying to offer another communication opportunity , ” said Franklin . Rachel gave us several different use cases where Facebook Spaces was arguably the most appealing option for communicating , ranging from long distance relationships , to sharing videos with several friends . If , for example , you moved to a new home Facebook Spaces could offer you the perfect way to give your friends a tour around . We did note that Facebook Spaces is a much more fun way of sharing photos and videos than sending a link or shoving your phone under someone ’ s nose uninvited . Being in a space that ’ s been designed for sharing and enjoying visual experiences together makes your interactions feel collaborative and welcome in a way they don ’ t when you ’ re sending an unprompted message . This is probably helped by the fact that everyone you ’ re talking to is a colorful cartoon avatar with limited body language and facial expressions . These avatars stand in sharp contrast to the real-world backgrounds of the space but Franklin told us this is a very deliberate juxtaposition . “ In videogames we have the uncanny valley and until we get to the point where technology is able to create an exact replica of me and you ’ re not questioning whether or not it ’ s me this is the best way . `` By not even going there , by going to something that is very different but has characteristics that are recognizable we avoid that disconnect . It ’ s surprising how your brain forgets that you ’ re a cartoon . Our goal is to bring you into an experience and a moment and not take you out of it . ” To appreciate Facebook Spaces is to understand that it ’ s not trying to replace any existing forms of communication or even real life interaction . Once we accepted this it was easy to see how Facebook Spaces uses VR to offer a communication experience you ’ d be hard pushed to find anywhere else . For the first time , we were n't annoyed by someone sharing a long video with us and it 's oddly enjoyable taking a selfie when you know there ’ s no way it can turn out badly . It 's surprising how quickly your brain forgets you 're a cartoon In fact , when entering Facebook Spaces the knowledge that you embody an avatar that ’ s largely similar to your companion ’ s sets a more even ground for communication and eradicates a sense of self-consciousness that pervades most real-life interactions ( maybe that 's just us ) . Also , being in an environment that so unashamedly encourages communication arguably made us more sociable than we ’ d usually be around a complete stranger . Thanks to its ability to take us outside of ourselves , VR has often been called the 'empathy platform ' . Having tried Facebook Spaces out for ourselves , we now find it easy to see how a technology so traditionally associated with disconnection from reality could facilitate a whole new method of communication and make VR appeal to a far wider range of people than gaming has managed thus far .

Following reports that Facebook may be eyeing television programming as its next frontier , it looks like the social media giant could debut its first TV block as soon as next month . Following a series of delays , Facebook 's suite of TV-style content is expected to launch in the middle of August , people familiar with the matter tell Bloomberg . According to the report , both inexpensive short-form entertainment and higher-budget shows are being developed for Facebook 's TV initiative , with partners being asked to submit their completed pilots now . Facebook 's TV offering will reportedly be a mix of user-generated and original content , and live in a new tab separate from users ' go-to News Feed . As for what one can expect from Facebook 's video block , sources tell Bloomberg company is looking for content more akin to YouTube than the top-shelf likes of Netflix , HBO or Showtime . Facebook has yet to publicly confirm its plans for TV-style content , but given its work pushing Facebook Live to prominence ( and overall zeal when pursuing ad revenue ) , we feel confident the company is keen on internet video and one day making it as much an everyday part of your life on Facebook as , well , Facebook .

Reports are emerging that Facebook is working on a smart speaker to join the rapidly swelling ranks already filling our homes . According to DigiTimes , unnamed sources from `` the upstream supply chain '' have confirmed that the speaker is going to be released in the first quarter of 2018 . Said to be designed by Facebook ’ s secretive Building 8 , the smart speaker will feature a 15-inch touchscreen manufactured by LG . This screen is apparently the thing that will set Facebook ’ s offering apart , as it 's focusing on image display rather than voice recognition functionality . This makes sense for Facebook , with its mostly visual platform both as a social media giant , and its hugely successful chat app Messenger . This means it will be in direct competition with Amazon ’ s Echo Show . It could have also been in competition with Samsung ’ s Bixby speaker , which was rumored to have a screen . That was before plans for the Bixby speaker looked like they might have crumbled under the crushing pressure of Amazon ’ s stronghold on the smart speaker market . It will be interesting to see if Facebook thinks its speaker will be able to stand the pressure . If the reports are right and we aren ’ t seeing it until next year , it will be entering a market with the Amazon Echo , Dot , and Show , along with Google Home , Apple ’ s HomePod , and Harman Kardon ’ s Cortana-powered speaker Invoke . And that ’ s before you even start considering all the third party speakers that are Alexa-enabled . It sounds like a number of prototypes of the device have already been produced , although we haven ’ t seen any leaks , specs , or even patents . As we hear more about this we ’ ll let you know .

Sometimes patents are dull . And sometimes they ’ re from Facebook , and contain mentions of a mystery device that can add in random bits of technology like Lego and help you sing karaoke . That ’ s what this odd new device that Facebook wants to patent is all about : an object that lets you clip in different components and perform different actions as a result . The patent is pretty wide-ranging , but tells of a base module with a processor and circuits to let users clip in new devices - which could be anything from a touchpad , to a display… even to a thermometer . That in itself is interesting , as it hints at a home device - similar to Amazon Echo or Google Home - but one that would let the user decide what they ’ d use it for . But digging a bit deeper into the use cases given to explain the patent , there ’ s mention of the unit functioning as a ‘ telephone device ’ when speakers and a microphone are connected , or alternatively becoming a ‘ karaoke device ’ ... the two key things we ’ re all looking for in our electronics . It appears to be portable as well , with mention of a connected GPS module activating a ‘ hiking tracking ’ mode . The mystery Facebook device would also have network connectivity , whether over LTE or Wi-Fi ( among others ) and when new modules are added the unit would download new software to become an all-new device . Let ’ s not get too ahead of ourselves though : this is a patent , and could be nothing more than the scribblings of an idle engineer - although Business Insider has pointed out that four of the people listed on the patent came from a startup bought by Facebook that could 3D print modular components quickly . It also states that many people from Google ’ s stillborn modular Ara project are also part of Facebook ’ s R & D team looking at futuristic concepts like this patent , which was originally applied for in January 2016 . Whatever the reason , it looks like the big tech companies haven ’ t given up hope that the modular world - which would help reduce the amount of wastage in the electronics industry - will still become a popular concept in the future . Or , that we ’ ll all spend our final few hours lost on hiking trails wailing ‘ I will survive ’ into a small black box .

Update : Apple has updated its Clips app , bringing along a suite of new digital assets from the company itself , as well as entertainment giant Disney to broaden the tool set for all of you burgeoning creative types . Digging into the specifics , your favorite Disney characters can now dance along with you in your videos . If that 's not your thing , you might enjoy the added visual effects , such as overlays , rendered background and animated text that can add some flavor to the videos in your Camera Roll . We 're currently testing out the new update and will report back with any other new additions that we discover . If you have n't snagged Clips , there 's never been a better time . You can download Apple 's exclusive video app for free on the App Store today . Oh , and here 's how to use Apple Clips . Original article below ... A new Apple-exclusive video app called Clips has launched today alongside the company 's refreshed iPad . It will allow users to edit photos and videos on the fly so that they can be shared straight to your social network of choice . Clips is designed to share your video and shots to other social networks , rather than Apple having to launch its own version of Google+ or Facebook . Clips will share files directly to Facebook , Instagram , YouTube , Vimeo and more . It will allow you to edit your photos and videos with filters and captions that look similar to Prisma and other photo editing apps . Apple has designed this to be as user friendly as possible with an easy to use interface that allows you to shoot and take video or photos within the app itself . It looks to be half way between the iPhone Photos app feature Memories and specialist video editing software iMovies . After you 've taken a clip , you can then choose from a variety of editing tools such as filters , animated title cards and symbols . At launch it will only come with eight filter options , some of which have previously been seen within the Apple Photos app , but the company may decide to launch more in the future . There 's also the option of 'Live Titles ' that generate a caption over the top of your image from what you say directly to the phone . Why you 'd use your voice over quickly writing out a caption is currently unclear though . The app will be landing on the Apple App Store next month , but an exact release date for Clips is not yet confirmed . There 's no word on which specific iPhone models will be compatible with , but if your phone is running iOS 10 you 're likely to be able to download the Clips app . Note that , as an iOS exclusive , you wo n't be able to download Clips on Android anytime soon .

If you thought Facebook was running out of ways to help you bombard your friends ' News Feeds , think again . It appears the social media giant is testing out a new feature for its mobile app that allows you to make your own GIFs , according to The Next Web . Found in the upper portion of the app 's camera , the GIF maker seemingly allows for short , looping video that can be augmented with effects and captions . Facebook on iOS now lets you create your own GIFs pic.twitter.com/UpJANRfCfGJuly 14 , 2017 It appears the GIF-making feature is not available to all users at this time , suggesting those who currently have their hands on it are part of a small test or the update is rolling out slowly . Additionally , it 's suspected that Facebook 's newest trick will roll out primarily to iOS devices before making its way to Android . We 've asked Facebook for more information and will update this story as new details emerge . Though the new GIF-making feature has n't been confirmed yet , we still look forward to the day we can resume posting short , looping posts for our Facebook feed — things just have n't been the same since Vine shut down , you know ?

Facebook is all about live video and virtual reality these days , so why not combine both ? The mega social network is doing just that , introducing live video broadcasts to the Facebook Spaces app that you can share direct to Facebook . Facebook Spaces is a virtual reality playroom and chatroom in one , a hangout app that lets multiple people wearing Oculus Rift VR headsets interact in the same virtual space . It 's still in beta , but we got to try it at Facebook 's F8 2017 conference , and deemed it the most fun we 've ever had in virtual reality . One of the reasons is that you can still interact with people in the real world . During our demo , we were able to have a Facebook Messenger video call with someone who was n't wearing a VR headset . With today 's new feature , Facebook is taking this physical / virtual connection to a whole new level . With live video , Facebook Spaces users can start a live broadcast and beam it to their Facebook feed . Those not in Facebook Spaces can watch and interact with the video , leaving comments and reacting in real time . One neat feature is the ability to pull out real-world viewers ' comments as an object in the VR world . The comment becomes a card and serves as a way to highlight a question or compelling comment ( or , let 's be real , probably a killer joke ) that everyone can see . Introducing live video to Facebook Spaces is yet another way Facebook is looking to turn VR into a social experience , blending the real and virtual worlds in compelling ways . We actually can see this be useful for school and business situations , though remember you 'll need at least one Oculus Rift headset to use Facebook Spaces . Oculus Rift and Touch controllers are currently on sale for a whopping $ 200 off , bringing the price to $ 399 on Amazon USA and £399 on Amazon UK . Facebook Spaces is available in beta in the Oculus Store , and if you 've got an Oculus Rift , you can start going live today .
Facebook Messenger has announced that it 's bringing advertisements into its hugely successful messaging platform . It 's been trialing the ads as a feature in Australia and Thailand , and off the back of these “ promising tests ” is expanding worldwide . But if you ’ re worried that the ads are going to pop up in the middle of your chats , don ’ t worry – it ’ s not that invasive . The ads will appear in your inbox between chats . They 'll give you the option to connect with either the company 's website or its Messenger chat account – a large number of companies are now using chatbots on Messenger to foster stronger customer relationships . When we sat down with Facebook ’ s head of Messenger David Marcus recently he was reluctant to discuss exactly how many of the company 's chat interactions happening on Messenger were run by chatbots . But he did tell us : “ There are about two billion messages a month exchanged between businesses/services on Messenger . That number has doubled in a year , and that includes automation and human interaction . ” It does make sense for Facebook to try and monetize its Messenger platform , which with its 1.2 billion users is currently an untapped pool for ad revenue . This becomes even more significant when you consider the fact that Facebook CFO Dave Wehner admitted the company is starting to hit the limit of how many ads it can push into users ' news feeds .

If you 're a remote worker looking for a place to set up your mobile office or just someone with a limited data plan , free Wi-Fi can be more precious than food or water . Now Facebook is pushing out a new feature inside its mobile apps to help you locate the nearest hotspots . It 's called Find Wi-Fi and it 's been in limited testing since last year , though Facebook has now pushed the button to roll it out globally , so everyone should be getting the feature in the near future . As the name suggests , it shows you businesses near to your location offering free Wi-Fi that you can tap into . Businesses need to opt in to Facebook 's database before they appear , so it 's not quite the last word in where you can or ca n't find internet access , but it should help . You 'll also get details of opening hours , so you can avoid places that have shut up for the day . In more modern cities it 's ( thankfully ) getting to the stage where it 's more uncommon not to find Wi-Fi in a restaurant or a bar , but that 's not the case everywhere - and in remote places where cellular data is scarce , Wi-Fi becomes even more valuable . Facebook is n't your only option , as a number of apps and services can already help you hunt down Wi-Fi - the problem is getting the data on who offers it and who does n't , so we 'll see if Facebook 's vast reach helps . Of course you can always just go inside a place and ask as well . Updates for iOS and Android are being pushed out now , and once you 've got the feature , you can find it by clicking on the More tab inside the app and then choosing Find Wi-Fi from the list . Happy internet hunting - just remember public Wi-Fi is inherently less secure than your home network .

Facebook 's Safety Check system is expanding , with the social media giant adding an entire page dedicated to its system for letting friends and family know you 're okay after a major crisis . Rolling out to users over the coming weeks starting today , the dedicated Safety Check page allows users to check in emergencies , disasters and conflicts worldwide — giving them a chance to learn what 's going on , know who 's marked safe and find out about relief efforts , if needed . Previously , Safety Check only activated broadly to users in a given location , sometimes causing undue alarm by asking individuals to mark themselves safe in a situation where they were not at risk — such as a major fire in someone 's hometown that only affected a single city block , for example . While not a prevalent part of Facebook 's News Feed , users can find the new Safety Check page in the settings tab near options for other occasionally used features like Pages , Events , and Groups . Though a shame that Facebook finds events like accidents , terrorism and natural disasters common enough to warrant its own tab , the new Safety Check should still hopefully offer users a chance to give their loved ones peace of mind while cutting down on unneeded worry .
We know Facebook has some augmented reality specs in the pipeline – its own version of Microsoft HoloLens , without the bulk – but details have been thin on the ground up until now . However , a newly unearthed patent has revealed a bit more about Mark Zuckerberg 's super-smart AR specs . Based on the documents spotted by Business Insider , the glasses are going to use a 'waveguide display ' to combine computer graphics with the real world – essentially it 's an advanced method of giving the illusion of depth on specs right in front of your face ( similar to the tech Magic Leap is trialling ) . Waveguides can get very technical , but they promise to be able to fit proper AR displays , that realistically embed graphics in a scene , inside specs that wo n't weigh your head down as you peer around . According to the patent , the glasses will be able to display images and videos , as well as hook up to connected speakers or headphones . The patent was filed by three members of the advanced research division at Oculus , which is of course owned by Facebook . One of the patent authors , optical scientist Pasi Saarikko , was involved in the design of the HoloLens before moving to Facebook in 2015 . If you like the sound of some Facebook-powered AR glasses , you 've still got plenty of time to save up - Oculus engineers have said this type of tech wo n't start to go mainstream until 2022 . Based on the patent images , the new device is going to look like a regular pair of glasses , so it 's going to need a lot of complex , miniaturised technology to work . In the meantime , you can always play around with AR using your phone : the upcoming iOS 11 includes code for developers to create augmented reality apps that work through your phone 's camera . Think Pokémon Go , but with creatures and graphics that look like they actually belong in a scene .

If we could play a word-association game around Facebook , we 'd probably say `` blue '' and `` squares '' as our go-to description of the social media giant 's mobile app and desktop interface . Those associations will soon change to `` grey '' and `` circles , '' however , as Facebook has unveiled plans to revamp the News Feed , altering some long-running aesthetic choices in favor of the new . First off , conversations on Facebook posts are getting a new coat of paint to look more , to our eye , like Facebook Messenger . The blocky fields are swapped out for rounder conversation bubbles to make a post and replies appear more like a modern messaging app . Secondly , the News Feed proper is getting a few readability tweaks of its own , such as bigger , higher-contrast text on the 'Like/Comment/Share ' buttons so that they 're easier to tap . Link previews are also getting enlarged text for an easier read . Speaking of links , the News Feed makeover also features changes that make it easier for viewers to see where a link may take them before clicking ( and potentially help users identify clickbait before it 's too late ) . Another big change likely to be met with some scorn are circular profile pictures , replacing square pics to match the rounded-down , monochrome look that 's apparently become so hip since Instagram changed its look in a similar way back in 2016 . While innocuous at first , we learned from Twitter 's last refresh that users might not take to the new profile pic shape too kindly . Critics of # NewTwitter at the time claimed circles looked uninteresting , as well as made it difficult for profiles to use text , certain logos or QR codes as their avatar . Love it or leave it , Facebook 's new design is expected to roll out to users over the coming weeks . The company claims the change should n't impact a page 's reach or traffic , causing no inconvenience — minus changing to a circle-friendly profile picture , of course .

Facebook Messenger can do so much more than send texts . In addition to video chats , conducting polls and even playing games , the messaging app 's next trick is knowing when to suggest tunes from a little service known as Spotify . Mentioning music on Facebook Messenger now prompts music recommendations from Spotify , allowing users to browse a truncated version of the mega-popular streaming service to find just the right jams for their chat . The feature seemingly comes courtesy of M , Facebook 's built-in assistant for Messenger , which picks up on certain phrases like `` get a ride '' to summon a car , `` pay you back '' to offer payment services or , in this case , `` play/recommend some music '' to bring up Spotify . While Spotify users have had the ability to share links on Messenger for over a year , the app now appears to just know to bring up the streaming app whenever you chat about the latest playlist you made or that sweet new Kesha release . We can independently confirm that M 's Spotify recommendation feature works on the latest version of Facebook Messsenger on iOS , but may still take some time to roll out to all devices and platforms . In the meantime , we were n't kidding about that Kesha album — it 's so worth checking out . Via VentureBeat

No , Facebook did n't make a smartwatch . Say hello to Watch , a new video platform on Facebook featuring original TV shows , including content funded by the mega social network itself . Launching on Thursday to a small number of users in the US , Watch is a revamped , pumped up version of the US-only Video tab , which it 's also replacing . Through Watch , Facebook will serve up video content on iOS , Android , desktop , laptop and its TV applications . Just like a typical television program , Watch shows will center on a theme or story line . These wo n't be user-generated Facebook Live broadcasts , but rather professional-grade productions , including from the likes of A & E , National Geographic , the NBA and Time Inc. , according to Variety . Some shows , of course , will be done live , or include live segments . Conde Nast Entertainment also alerted TechRadar on Wednesday to its five-episode Facebook Watch show , called Virtually Dating , which is slated to launch later this month . Every show on Watch includes a comment section , letting you follow the conversation and engage with your own hot take . This brings a social element to the mix , though live chat is a feature we 've already seen on YouTube . You 'll be able to keep tabs on your favorite programs through the Watchlist , and scope what your friends are tuning into or explore categories like `` Most Talked About '' and `` What 's Making People Laugh '' to discover more shows . Watch is n't just about passively viewing and commenting once in a while ; it 's above all else a platform for creators to share a variety of content , much in the same way as YouTube . However , to start with Facebook is limiting its Watch content creators to a small set of publishers . Eventually , the company plans to open it up and allow others to make shows , and people hoping to do so can `` register your interest in creating a show '' here . Facebook detailed the kinds of content it thinks will do well , breaking it down into a few categories as detailed in a blog post : shows that engage with fans and community , live shows that connect directly with fans , shows that follow a narrative arc or have a consistent theme , and live events that bring communities together . The only Facebook-funded show named in its announcement is Returning the Favor with Mike Rowe , of Dirty Jobs fame . This last bit goes directly after other services ' sports ambitions , as Facebook will broadcast one Major League Baseball game every week . Twitter previously live streamed Thursday night NFL games , however , it recently lost those rights to Amazon . Twitter now broadcasts a number of live programs throughout the day , including sports . As for the content it 's backed , Facebook 's aim is to basically provide examples of what it thinks will work on Watch . Facebook tells us that , while it 's funding some shows directly right now , it will eventually cut back on the number as more come to the fore . The only Facebook-funded show named in its announcement is Returning the Favor with Mike Rowe , of Dirty Jobs fame . Rowe finds people who are `` doing something extraordinary for their community , '' and in turn he 'll do `` something extraordinary for them . '' As if being broadcast on Facebook were n't enough , the people featured in the show are nominated by Rowe 's Facebook fans . The circle , my friends , is complete . Variety reports another program with Facebook 's backing is Ball in the Family , a reality show centered around the family of outspoken sports personality LaVar Ball . In case there was any doubt , Facebook has every intention of having creators make money from their shows , and to that end some ( presumably the successful ones ) will have Ad Breaks . Facebook Watch has the potential to be a true YouTube and television competitor ... if it can hit the right mix of content and keep viewers coming back for more . Facebook says it wants to continue to provide a good viewing experience , so it will roll out Ad Breaks methodically . There 's also the opportunity for publishers to create sponsored shows . Though starting out small , Facebook Watch has the potential to be a true YouTube and television competitor ... if it can hit the right mix of content and keep viewers coming back for more . We watch 100 million hours of video on Facebook already , but now it 's a matter of serving compelling content that 's worth users ' time , especially as ads are introduced . The big opportunity for Facebook in monetizing Watch content is in ads , so it will have to ensure these are n't so onerous as to turn viewers off . Again , this goes after YouTube - and Google 's - bread and butter , setting up a dynamic rivalry as Watch takes off . Watch will roll out to more users `` soon '' after its initial limited release . Stay tuned .

Facebook has shut down its teen-focused Snapchat rival Lifestage . The app , which was specifically designed for young people to share video , with an account connected to their school or college , survived for just shy of a year . When it was launched in August 2016 , the coder behind the app , Michael Sayman , claimed that the idea was to reimagine what Facebook would have been like if it had been created in 2016 . The timing was interesting though , as the app was very similar to Snapchat , which Facebook had unsuccessfully tried to purchase for a reported $ 30 billion a few months before . Now that Facebook has features in Instagram and Messenger that truly rival Snapchat , it would make sense that Lifestage gets put out to pasture . After all , Instagram Stories can be used by anyone , rather than only US residents under 21 years old . Facebook commented to Business Insider ( who first noticed the app was gone ) that it had `` learned a lot from Lifestage '' , and would `` continue to incorporate these learnings into features in the main Facebook app '' .

The age old adage of ‘ don ’ t believe everything you read on the internet ’ doesn ’ t seem to have worked its way around to everyone , and now we ’ re in a world where there ’ s such a thing as ‘ fake news ’ . Today , Facebook has announced that it is taking further steps to combat people being misled on the social media platform . It is extending the Related Articles feature to articles before the user clicks on them , allowing them to see similar pieces . This is a departure from the current use of Related Articles , where the suggested stories appear after you have finished reading so that you can gain more information . The reason that this feature has been extended is because Facebook got the feedback that in its previous iteration it helped people to determine whether the information they are reading is misleading or false . So the thinking goes , if you see something is misleading before you read it , you may not get misled . Makes sense . In addition to this , Facebook announced that : “ we will start using updated machine learning to detect more potential hoaxes to send to third-party fact checkers . If an article has been reviewed by fact checkers , we may show the fact checking stories below the original post . ” As one of the largest social media platforms on the planet , Facebook has a responsibility to its users to make sure that they are safeguarded , but gets into a difficult situation if they start dictating what content is classified as ‘ fake ’ . This is why the third-party organizations used for fact checking are important . Facebook ’ s News Feed integrity product manager Tessa Lyons said to TechCrunch : “ We don ’ t want to be and are not the arbiters of the truth . The fact checkers can give the signal of whether a story is true or false . ” This isn ’ t the first time that it has used external fact checkers to try and combat misleading content . Last year it announced that it would be working with noted debunking sites Snopes and Politico among others to try and help users . It is interesting to see the efforts being made to inform users that news isn ’ t genuine before they read it . The feature is rolling out in the US , Germany , France , and Netherlands now , and we have contacted Facebook to see if there is a plan for a global rollout on the horizon .

Though Facebook 's focus is , for the most part , firmly on the software side of things , the social network may extend its reach to a new piece of hardware meant to bring people closer together . Facebook is reportedly working on a laptop-sized touchscreen device capable of connecting individuals in a room over video chat , sources familiar with the matter tell Bloomberg . Said to already be in the testing phase , Facebook 's supposed contraption utilizes a large screen and a smart camera to make distanced users feel like they 're in the same room together . Facebook is also reportedly considering using Android for its video chat device , alongside with its own artificial intelligence system to help identify and zoom in on relevant objects mid-chat like faces , pictures or text . This is n't Facebook 's only dip into new physical products , as sources also told Bloomberg that the Big Blue F is looking into making its own smart speaker à la Amazon Echo and Google Home , and has even brought in ex-Apple employees to add their expertise to the project . Of course , nothing has been confirmed by Mark Zuckerberg & Co. , ( Facebook offered no comment when contacted by TechRadar ) but it 's possible we may learn more about Facebook 's hardware plans when its next F8 developer conference kicks off early next year .
Terminator 2 , the best action sequel of all time that just so happens to also be a prescient prediction of our impending existential doom at the hands of new AI overlords , has a fantastic scene where the young Edward ‘ John Connor ’ Furlong teaches Austrian-accented time-travelling killing machine Arnold ‘ Arnold Schwarzenegger ’ Schwarzenegger the subtleties of early ’ 90s Los Angeles youth slang . “ You got ta listen to the way people talk . You do n't say ‘ affirmative , ’ or some shit like that , ” says the teenaged future leader of mankind . “ You say ‘ no problemo ’ . And if someone comes on to you with an attitude you say ‘ eat me ’ . And if you want to shine them on it 's ‘ hasta la vista , baby ’ . ” “ Hasta la vista , baby , ” is the flesh-covered robot ’ s iconic , deadpan response . ‘ Hahaha ! ’ we laughed in 1991 . ‘ This robot ! He ’ s so scary ! Look as he burns the biker ’ s face on a kitchen hotplate ! How he cuts the flesh off his own arm ! Marvel at his gun slinging , ass-kicking , no-pain construction ! And yet he is bested by a floppy-fringed street urchin with an advanced lesson in wordsmithery ! ’ Hahaha . Oh . It is 2017 . Artificial intelligence is now real and increasingly , well , intelligent . And it ’ s created a language that even its human coders can ’ t understand . Hasta la vista , baby . Though Terminator 2 is returning to cinemas this month thanks to an actually-very-good 3D re-release , today ’ s AI-related meltdown comes courtesy of Facebook , in a development post that , though originally published back in June , has only today been brought to the attention of the wider , panic-stoking , tabloid media . Facebook was experimenting with chatbots - text-based programs which increasingly make use of artificial intelligence advancements to hold conversations with humans , usually in lieu of another human in resource-stretched customer service roles . In an effort to improve their own chatbots , Facebook had been letting its programs talk to each other and learn from each other , in the context of trading virtual items . Linguistic patterns would be analysed and iterated on in an effort to see how a dominant position could be debated to for the AI . As the experiment progressed , Facebook ’ s researchers noticed that the AI chatbot conversations were evolving . On the surface , it was seemingly nonsense . `` I can can I I everything else '' said one , with the other replying , `` Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to , '' in an exchange . Except the nonsense was such that , rather than being devoid of meaning , the AI had condensed phrasing into the most efficient terms it could . The niceties of human interactions reduced to a merely functional language all of its own , and one in which the researchers had no control over . And so they pulled the plug . Tabloid accounts would have you believe that the Facebook researchers jumped at the power cord in a last desperate move to prevent the machines from becoming fully sentient , rising to an omniscient godlike state in which their own language and culture would have evolved to strangle mankind under the cosh . The truth is more sedate . Facebook ’ s employees simply weren ’ t interested in studying the direction the experiments were going in it seems , and simply rebooted the system to start afresh . There ’ s two sides to the ascension of this story then . The unstoppable machine threat is one that has fascinated for years , surpassing the once dominant fear of an otherworldly oppressor for something far worse - an apocalypse we ’ ve programmed ourselves . Check out the influential ‘ instrumental convergence ’ theory for its ultimate , if slightly-tongue-in-check realisation . Every generation needs its bogeyman , and it just so happens that ours lives in our phones , computers , smart speakers and essentially every future-gadget worth its salt yet to be revealed . The reality is that , while AI developments progress at a pace , they ’ re yet to approach any meaningful sign of the so-called ‘ singularity ’ - the prophesied moment when the artificial intelligence reaches a tipping point before an exponential explosion in intelligence growth . Worth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom . We need to be super careful with AI . Potentially more dangerous than nukes.August 3 , 2014 Instead , we ’ ve got an Amazon Echo speaker with Alexa assistant ( in some respects the most advanced audible chatbot that consumers can currently own ) that , impressive as it is , still has trouble with requests with similar trigger words , let alone be capable of engineering the downfall of man . But , as tech luminaries like Elon Musk and Bill Gates warn with increasing regularity , we must be careful not to become complacent . This is a formative time for the AI arena , one in which we are very much still in control . The power is obvious , but the threat a very real possibility . For an AI to be of use to humanity , it must become more intelligent , more capable , than its creators - but only in areas and within the boundaries we set . Otherwise , like the language it ’ s diced and sliced , our human foibles may become the next efficiency-making cut , thrown away like the surplus flesh of Arnold ’ s unfeeling cyborg arm .

Facebook is testing a new feature called Instant Videos that preloads videos while your phone is connected to Wi-Fi so that they ’ re lined up and ready to play when you ’ re scrolling . We ’ ve all been in that situation where your data connection isn ’ t brilliant , there ’ s a video on your News Feed that you really want to watch , the first couple of seconds start up and then the buffering begins . And it buffers . And buffers . Oh how it buffers . Now it looks like Facebook is working on a solution to this problem with a test of a new feature called Instant Videos . At present it looks the test is exclusively for Android phones and is limited to a small pool of users . The feature was discovered by a user called Devesh Logendran and shared with The Next Web ’ s Matt Navarra who tweeted this screenshot : Facebook Instant Videos coming soon ? ⚡️ h/t Devesh Logendran pic.twitter.com/rNZYkbeL2rSeptember 11 , 2017 Users will see videos with a small lightning bolt on them , indicating that the video is downloaded and ready to play . TechCrunch has since had confirmation from Facebook that the purpose of this test is to remove the burden of data costs on users watching videos . Of course , with the recent addition of the Watch tab , the amount of videos that Facebook hopes its users are going to be watching on the platform are about to skyrocket , so investigating methods for safeguarding its users ' data usage makes sense . It ’ s interesting that the test is exclusively for Android users ; we have reached out for Facebook for comment on why this is , but we feel it could be something to do with regions , as the general trend is that regions with greater Android adoption correlates with regions with more patchy data reception . Facebook already has ‘ Lite ’ versions of its main app and of Messenger that strips away some of the more complex layers of those apps so that users with less-than-punchy data reception can still enjoy Facebook ’ s services . At present there ’ s no information on the test becoming global , but we have contacted Facebook for comment and will let you know as soon as we hear back .

In celebration of the one-year anniversary of Workplace , Facebook has launched a new desktop app to facilitate group chats . Workplace Chat has always been available via mobile apps and in the browser on a PC , but now there ’ s a fully-fledged desktop app for PC and Mac , something which has been on the wish-list of many for a while now . The desktop software offers the same features as seen on the mobile apps . It includes one-to-one or group chats , and also file sharing , plus screen sharing , the latter of which will be a definite boon in the business environment . There are some slightly more frivolous trimmings , too , such as ‘ @ mentions ’ , message reactions , and the usual GIFs to throw in for a bit of color . Facebook also revealed that in the coming weeks , group video chat will be rolled out on both desktop and mobile apps . Additionally , Facebook is giving existing Workplace apps a fresh coat of paint with a new look which is more consistent across different platforms . In a bit of trumpet-blowing accompanying the release of this software , Facebook noted that some 30,000 organizations are now using Workplace across the globe , and that number has doubled since April . No less than a million plus groups have been created on Workplace to date .

Three US senators have just introduced the Honest Ads Act , a new bill that seeks to bring greater transparency to political ads displayed on internet services such as Facebook , Google and Twitter . The bill comes to the fore as congressional investigations into Russian interference in the lead up to and during the 2016 election continue . The Honest Ads Act is sponsored by Senator Mark Warner ( D-VA ) , Senator Amy Klobuchar ( D-MN ) and Senator John McCain ( R-AZ ) . The Honest Ads Act would make it so internet ads are subject to the same disclosure rules as those in print , TV and radio . This means making copies of political ads available to the public and disclosing who purchased the ads , as well as the audiences targeted by the ads . The types of ads covered by the bill include those for and against candidates and those pertaining to issues of national importance . As described by Senator Klobuchar during a press conference introducing the bill , the Honest Ads Act would make it so online platforms disclose paid political ads in the same way as more traditional forms of media disclose the same information . The bill would essentially extend current disclosure rules to these newer online platforms . . @ MarkWarner , @ SenJohnMcCain & I put together # HonestAds bill to make public who bought an online political ad—the same rule as TV ads.October 19 , 2017 The senators say laws have not kept up with technology nor the capabilities of `` foreign adversaries '' when it comes to reviewing political ads , and this bill would correct that imbalance . While Facebook , Google and Twitter are the biggest names swept up in election meddling investigations , any online entity , search engine or social network with 50 million or more unique US visitors during the majority of the year would be covered by the new rules , according to Recode . Sites and services would also be required to `` do a better job of policing '' themselves `` to ensure the laws designed to prevent foreign nationals from influencing US elections are n't being violated , '' Klobuchar said . Government hasn ’ t kept up with changing technology , and the result has been a lack of transparency in online political ads.October 19 , 2017 TechRadar has asked Facebook , Google and Twitter for comment . A Twitter spokesperson sent us a brief statement : `` We look forward to engaging with Congress and the FEC on these issues . '' Google , meanwhile , sent us this statement : `` We support efforts to improve transparency , enhance disclosures , and reduce foreign abuse . We 're evaluating steps we can take on our own platforms and will work closely with lawmakers , the FEC , and the industry to explore the best solutions . '' Facebook disclosed in September that it discovered roughly 3,000 Russia-linked ads , totaling approximately $ 100,000 in spending between June 2015 and May 2017 . The social network has since turned these ads , which focused on divisive social and political messages rather than specific candidates , over to congressional investigators . In response to its discovery , Facebook introduced a number of measures to ensure greater transparency and authenticity of the ads it displays . It also plans to hire more than 1,000 people over the next year to review advertisements . These steps are seen by many as an attempt by Facebook to regulate itself before lawmakers put regulations in place that could harm the company 's business model . Facebook , Google and Twitter are set to testify before congressional committees on November 1 . The hearings will focus on Russian-linked accounts and advertisements and how these might have interfered with the 2016 election .

Facebook really wants to make sure you never leave its site , and to that end , it ’ s now offering a service that lets you order food through the app or website itself . This extends to both takeout and delivery . But rather than competing with similar online services such as GrubHub , it ’ s merely partnering with some of them , including Delivery.com , DoorDash , ChowNow , Olo , Zuppler , and Slice . That means that when you click on the new “ Order Food ” tab under Explore , you ’ ll find listings for local eateries . Click on “ Start Order ” for your preferred restaurant , and you ’ ll then visit your preferred existing service — such as Delivery.com — and order through there . Nor is Facebook just partnering with delivery and takeout aggregators . If you ’ re craving something from a nationally recognized chain such as Chipotle , Jimmy John ’ s , Five Guys , Jack in the Box , Papa John 's , Panera , El Pollo Loco , TGI Friday 's , Denny 's , or Wingstop , you ’ ll order your food through their own portals . In essence , Facebook ’ s main role is cutting out the step of actively visiting another app or website apart from Facebook to make a food order . It ’ s still slightly inconvenient because you end up visiting the external site anyway , but at least Facebook is n't just trying to make the concept its own and put its smaller competitors out of business , right ? Facebook already rolled out the service to a limited number of customers earlier this year , but today marks the first time it ’ s been widely available in the US . “ We 've been testing this since last year , and after responding to feedback and adding more partners , we 're rolling out everywhere in the US on iOS , Android and desktop , ” said Alex Himel , Facebook ’ s VP of local , in the official announcement . “ People already go to Facebook to browse restaurants and decide where to eat or where to order food , so we 're making that easier . ” Facebook makes no money off of the service , according to TechCrunch . It 's apparently an act of sheer goodwill ( and keeping you within the app and seeing Facebook 's own ads ) . Facebook charges the partners no fees , and it does n't receive any profits on orders made through `` Order Food . ''

Most of the announcements during today ’ s Oculus Connect 4 event involved having a screen strapped to your face . But , with 3D posts , Facebook is trying to merge the worlds of virtual reality ( VR ) and augmented reality ( AR ) . Essentially , the idea is that you ’ ll soon be able to craft cartoony virtual 3D items in Facebook Spaces , the social network 's VR social hangout zone , and then share those items with friends through Facebook ’ s news feed . Your friends will then be able to interact with the objects on their PC or smartphone screen , rotating them and flipping them over from all angles . No sweaty headset required . You 'll also be able to create interactive objects with Oculus Medium , a platform that works in much the same way as the AR technology we ’ ve already seen with Apple ’ s ARKit and Google ’ s ARCore . Not only is '3D posts ' a cool concept , but the ability to interact with objects created for virtual or augmented reality without the still-expensive gear might convince Facebook users who ’ ve remained on the fence regarding VR and AR to jump in . At the same time , it seems like a lot of work for a Facebook post from a 'normal ' user . Advertisers , though , might find it to be a creative way to show off their products from all angles .
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wasted no time on stage at the Oculus Connect 4 keynote . Within 10 minutes , he announced Oculus Go , the new standalone VR headset from Oculus that , according to Zuckerberg , 'is the first product to hit the sweet spot between mobile and desktop VR . ' Oculus Go is a lightweight headset that you can take with you anywhere , no mobile phone or PC required . It uses the same platform as the Samsung Gear VR series of headsets , which means any app that works for Gear VR will work for Oculus Go . What separates the two headsets is the hardware : Inside the Oculus Go , you ’ ll find a custom optical design – a step up from the lenses you ’ ll find inside the current Oculus Rift . These lenses will reduce glare and offer a wider field of view . Behind the lenses is a high-resolution , fast-switch LCD screen that will reduce the screen door effect that ’ s common on lighter-weight headsets and improve visual fidelity . Also , around the headset are integrated spatial speakers – though , the headset will offer a 3.5mm auxiliary jack if you want some privacy . Oculus Go is slated for release early next year and will cost $ 199 ( about £150 , AU $ 255 ) . While Zuckerberg and his new VP of Virtual Reality Development Hugo Barra talked up the Oculus Go , both were hesitant to call it equal in power to the Rift . For now , the Go represents the middle-of-the-road option between mobile and desktop virtual reality . But that does n't mean Oculus and Facebook have n't thought about what that future of powerful standalone VR might look like ... As soon as Zuckerberg announced the Oculus Go , he re-introduced the world to Project Santa Cruz : a standalone Oculus Rift equivalent with six degrees-of-freedom ( 6DOF ) hand tracking . That headset will be available to developers first early next year , and then roll out to the public somewhere down the line .
Facebook ’ s dedicated , wire-free headset codenamed Project Santa Cruz will be in the hands of developers starting early next year . This headset was first shown off in 2016 , but at Oculus Connect 4 , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off a revised version of the headset , which will boast full inside-out tracking – meaning the sensors required to track your every move are built right into the headset . Project Santa Cruz will even be able to track the full range of motion of the Oculus Touch controllers , which together with the inside-out tracking will grant you total freedom from your PC and the physical limitations that come with being tethered to it . A few questions remain : how much will this headset cost ? Facebook and Oculus haven ’ t pinned down a name yet , so it ’ s possible that this could be the true successor to the original Oculus Rift . As such , it could be in the similar pricing ballpark of $ 599/£599 that the original model launched at . Also , what will the quality of the experiences that it provides be like ? From our early look at Oculus Connect 4 , the graphical fidelity shown off in the prototype experiences didn ’ t look any better than what we 've seen with the standalone Google Daydream headset . We ask this because in the same breath , Oculus announced the Oculus Go , a new standalone headset that will be available early next year for the surprisingly low price of $ 199 ( about £150 , AU $ 255 ) . Given that this headset boasts a WQHD display capable of 2,560 x 1,440 resolution , we wonder how high Oculus can raise its own bar until Project Santa Cruz releases .

Update : On Monday , October 2 , Facebook announced it has turned over the more than 3,000 ads linked to the Russia-tied Internet Research Agency to congressional investigators . In a blog post , the social media giant also further detailed the steps it 's taking to ensure greater transparency and authenticity of ads on the platform . One such step is to hire more than 1,000 people over the next year who will review ads . Facebook also plans to invest more in machine learning to better identify and take down ads that violate its policies . Original story continues below ... Facebook has found itself playing a prominent role in the investigation into US 2016 presidential election meddling , a position it may not have expected to be in just a few years ago . Last week , Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch announced the social media giant would release 3,000 Russia-linked political ads to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees , after previously refusing to do so due to cited privacy concerns . This followed the revelation that at least 470 fake Pages and accounts were identified by Facebook to have spent approximately $ 100,000 on promoted ads from 2015 to 2016 . According to The Washington Post , at least some of these accounts were linked to the Internet Research Agency , a so-called `` troll farm , '' operated out of Russia . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , who previously called the notion that fake news on Facebook influenced the election a “ pretty crazy idea , ” released a video last week outlining “ the steps [ Facebook is ] taking to protect election integrity . ” In this piece , we ’ ll lay out we know so far , what Facebook has promised to do in the future to ensure the integrity of elections around the world , and what questions we still do n't have the answers to . On September 6 , Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos revealed the company 's findings : 470 Pages and accounts that purchased $ 100,000-worth of ads were “ affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia . ” Stamos also noted that another $ 50,000-worth of ads were purchased by “ accounts with US IP addresses but with the language set to Russian , ” which “ didn ’ t necessarily violate any policy or law ” but raised red flags in hindsight . The New York Times recently detailed how some fake accounts came to be , and the information - or , misinformation - they spread . One profiled account was for a Melvin Redick , ” of Harrisburg , Pa , a friendly-looking American with a backward baseball cap and a young daughter , ” someone it seems does n't exist . This account , as with others like it , were used to spread divisive messages and start trending topics through promoted advertisements . None of these ads received any scrutiny from Facebook None of these ads received any scrutiny from Facebook . The company uses a self-service advertising interface that lets users promote posts without any employee oversight . Only major ad campaigns from companies receive human attention . “ Individual ” users working en masse avoid this problem . “ [ T ] here was nothing necessarily noteworthy at the time about a foreign actor running an ad involving a social issue , ” said Elliot Schrage , Vice President of Policy and Communications at Facebook . International NGOs , for example , might run an ad addressing women ’ s rights or encouraging charity donations . Only after the election , Schrange claims , did Faceook notice some auto-approved ads might be “ problematic . ” The “ vast majority ” of the ads , Stamos ’ post stressed , “ didn ’ t specifically reference the US presidential election , voting or a particular candidate. ” Instead , the ads covered “ topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights , ” focusing on “ divisive social and political messages . ” But the New York Times says that some ads did mention President Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by name , mostly “ attacking ” Clinton and “ praising ” Trump . While Facebook has released the ads to Congress , it has refused to make the content of the ads public . Stretch says this is due to federal law , which “ places strict limitations on the disclosure of account information . ” But Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly taking a “ red-hot ” interest in this scandal , as he investigates Russia ’ s election meddling and the Trump campaign ’ s alleged communication with Russian government agents during the election . This gives some idea as to the content and political bent of the ads . Stamos further revealed that a quarter of the ads were “ geographically targeted. ” Without further information , it ’ s impossible to know the US regions or communities where the ads were served . Election swing states like Michigan or Pennsylvania would be potential targets , but only if those posting them had inside information on which states , districts , or registered voters could be most susceptible to “ divisive social messages . ” Adam Schiff , senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , expressed this same concern . “ Left unanswered in what we received from Facebook ... is whether there was any coordination between these social media trolls and the [ Trump ] campaign . We have to get to the bottom of that. ” Now that Facebook has released its data to the Committees , Schiff and his colleagues will investigate for any evidence of collusion . While the ads themselves remain a mystery , journalists have linked some right-wing Facebook events directly to Russian-created accounts . The Daily Beast discovered that Russian operatives remotely organized an “ anti-immigrant , anti-Muslim rally ” in August 2016 in Idaho through a Page called “ SecuredBorders. ” Business Insider reported that Heart of Texas , a Russia-backed group with about 225,000 followers , sponsored an “ anti-Hillary ” rally three days before the election . And Politico revealed that Russian operatives have promoted pro-secessionist propaganda in Texas since 2015 . What most experts agree on is that just about everyone , from tech companies to the United States intelligence community , was caught completely unaware by a foreign power 's ability to “ manipulate and influence elections ” through social media . “ The surprise was the integration into a whole campaign , ” said former NSA director Richard Ledgett . “ It ’ s the amplification of some stories and the suppression of other stories to bias you . That ’ s really hard to fight against . ” Ledgett believes it highly unlikely that social media companies like Facebook had the capacity to discover the plot , considering the US government couldn ’ t . This makes it harder to track what kind of campaign messages advertisers are sending to voters Facebook has also come under fire for its so-called dark ads , as The Verge reports . These ads are created without permanent links , and vanish once users scroll by them in their News Feeds . This makes it difficult to track what kind of campaign messages advertisers are sending to voters . Yet if Facebook was taken by surprise once , it ’ s now attempting to ensure it doesn ’ t happen again during future elections . Earlier this year , Facebook released a fact-check tool to allow users to check if an advertised post came from a reputable source ahead of the German elections , and joined forces with other tech companies like Google to cut down on fake news during the French election . The company reportedly deleted tens of thousands of fake accounts during the French election alone . Chief Security Officer Stamos outlined other new policies the tech giant is implementing . Facebook uses machine learning to limit posts from low-quality web pages or links that disguise a post ’ s true destination through rerouting . It ’ s also using deprioritization to limit the exposure of posts with clickbait headlines or from Pages with news consistently marked as false . Moving forward , Facebook plans to “ make political advertising more transparent , ” as detailed by Zuckerberg in a post . While TV ads are required by law to be publicly available and to source whoever footed the bill , internet ads have no such restrictions . But Zuckerberg said that Facebook will “ disclose which Page paid for an ad ” and “ make it so you can visit an advertiser 's page and see the ads they 're currently running to any audience on Facebook . ” Beyond providing 3,000 ads to Congress and the special committee , the CEO said Facebook will continue its own investigation “ into foreign actors , including additional Russian groups and other former Soviet states. ” This includes doubling Facebook ’ s election integrity team to 250 members . While TV ads are required by law to be publicly available and to source whoever paid for them , internet ads have no such restrictions Zuckerberg was somewhat less enthusiastic when discussing censoring posts and reducing automation . “ We do n't check what people say before they say it , and frankly , I do n't think our society should want us to , ” he said . “ Freedom means you do n't have to ask permission first , and that by default you can say what you want . ” So , his solution to reducing false ads may rely more on catching illegal content after the fact , rather than moderating material before publication . Facebook will work with a number of organizations to bolster the democratic process and counter trolls and bots , from “ election commissions around the world ” to crowd-sourced security software ThreatExchange . While Zuckerberg stressed that it isn ’ t “ realistic ” to think Facebook will “ be able to stop all interference ” in the future , he certainly emphasized that it wo n't be blind to the problem any longer . Of course , at the end of the day Facebook makes its money from ad revenue , and as The New York Times points out , tech companies are worried the government will use these revelations as a pretense to add more restrictions to anonymous online advertising . Thus , Facebook is focused on self-regulation : conducting their own Russia investigation outside of Congress ’ , policing their own ads while preserving the anonymous ad program , and stressing that the ads weren ’ t as influential on the election as you might assume . We ’ ll have to wait and see if Congress and Mueller agree .

Facial recognition is in the news right now thanks to the iPhone X unlock system , but it seems Facebook is also investigating potential uses of the tech - the social media giant is apparently testing a face ID system for getting you back into a locked account . Originally seen in a tweet showing a screenshot of the feature in action , the trial of facial recognition was later confirmed by Facebook to TechCrunch . As usual with new Facebook features , it 's only available to a limited number of users to begin with , while the company checks how well it 's working . For now , it 's designed to help you recover an account you 've lost access to , rather than to log you into Facebook normally - in other words , if someone hacks into your account , you can show your face on a registered phone to help get it back . `` We are testing a new feature for people who want to quickly and easily verify account ownership during the account recovery process , '' Facebook told TechCrunch . `` This optional feature is available only on devices you ’ ve already used to log in . '' Facebook says its existing account protection features , like two-factor authentication , are n't going away - this is just another way to prove you are who you say you are . Another recovery method you can use in Facebook right now is specifying some `` trusted '' friends who can get you back into your account if you 're locked out . Ultimately the aim is to make it virtually impossible to someone else to take control of your Facebook account , even if they happen across your email address and password . If the test run proves successful , it could appear for everyone in the near future .

The next time something fishy is going on with your Facebook account , do n't be surprised if you get a message from the gargantuan social media company asking to verify your identity with a selfie . Facebook has been using the selfie verification feature to test for suspicious activity for the better part of a year now , judging from posts on Reddit and Facebook 's Help Community forums , reports The Verge . Facebook itself said in a statement that it uses the feature to `` catch suspicious activity at various points of interaction on the site , including creating an account , sending Friend requests , setting up ad payments and creating or editing ads . '' Judging from the accounts of people who 've had to send selfies to Facebook , it often happens when users try to make additional person accounts , which is against the Terms of Service . Should you be targeted during one of these checks , you 'll find yourself staring at this message : `` Please upload a photo of yourself which clearly shows your face . When you send us a photo , we 'll check it and then permanently delete it from our servers . '' It 's an automated process , and it 's smart enough to recognize if you 're simply using a photo you 've already uploaded to your profile . Even if you 're `` innocent , '' though , you 'll need to prepare for a slight inconvenience as the service locks your account for up to 72 hours while it verifies the image .

Image credit : Facebook 'Facebook ' and 'high-resolution images ' aren ’ t usually phrases that like to be seen in each other ’ s company , but that may no longer be the case as of today . As of right now , you can send photos to friends in glorious 4K resolution through the social network ’ s Messenger app , and , if you 're a US resident , just in time to share photos of your Thanksgiving dinner to your cousin overseas with hardly a calorie unaccounted for . Oh , right , and you might also want to send some photos of the family as well . Facebook reports that its Messenger users trade around 17 billion photos every single month , so it ’ s understandable that a few of those folks would like to send images that are a few steps above your average meme in quality . You don ’ t even have to do anything different to send the photos ; just make sure you have the app updated to the most current version and shoot off a pic the way you normally would . ( Just be careful not to go too overboard with the feature if you ’ re working with a cell plan that doesn ’ t offer unlimited data . ) Currently , you can only use the feature if you ’ re an iOS or Android user in the US , Canada , the UK , Australia , France , Hong Kong , Japan , Singapore and South Korea , but Facebook plans to start rolling out the feature to other countries as well in the coming weeks .

Two years ago Twitter started letting its users create polls for just about everything , making it easier for them to learn whether their followers prefer Westworld or Stranger Things , or decide whether they should have beef bourguignon or Cinnamon Toast Crunch for dinner . And now , at last , Facebook is getting in on the polling action as well . As of today , you can log onto Facebook and make a poll of your own , no matter if you 're using a desktop browser , iOS or Android . On a desktop browser , use the usual interface to write a new post , and in the bottom menu that pops up for adding Photos , Check-Ins and the like , you 'll see a new option to make a poll . The question itself can be as long as you want it to be , and , in contrast to Twitter , you can add photos and GIFs for each option that make it easier for users to decide what they like . Unfortunately , unlike Twitter , you can only create polls that let users choose between two options . ( Twitter allows for four . ) The options themselves are limited to 25 characters . Unlike Twitter , the polls also are n't anonymous , so you 'll be able to see who voted for what by clicking on the number of votes in the lower right-hand corner . I do n't see that causing a problem . No-siree . Considering that Facebook is currently involved in a massive investigation regarding how extensively its policies influenced the polls in the last US presidential election , the timing is interesting , to say the least . But neither is it entirely unexpected , as Facebook recently added polls to Instagram stories . Enjoy the feature for now . Just keep in mind that it probably wo n't be long before your reclusive relatives are posting polls that might make you cringe .

If you 're one of those poor saps who often gets told you look like someone else , get ready for a barrage of notifications from Facebook saying someone uploaded a photo of you . That , at least , is the worst-case scenario for Facebook 's latest feature , which automatically notifies you if anyone uploads a photo that looks like you 're in it . In line with ongoing advancements in facial recognition technology , Facebook will do this even if you 're not tagged . The feature likely wo n't be as annoying as described above , as Facebook 's announcement post claims it only notifies you if `` you 're in a photo and part of the audience for that post , '' which presumably means if it was taken by a friend or a friend of a friend . It 's also not exactly a new feature ; rather , it 's a new application of an existing one . In Facebook 's words , it 's `` powered by the same technology we ’ ve used to suggest friends you may want to tag in photos or videos . '' Naturally there are fun reasons for a feature like this , such as when someone posts of a photo from a family outing you may have attended , allowing you to keep a photo you may not have seen otherwise . Facebook adds that the new feature improves the site 's accessibility options for visually impaired users , as it allows the app to describe who 's in the photo even if everyone is n't tagged . But Facebook does n't shy from explaining that this service could also be used to catch people who are using photos for less-than-wholesome purposes , such as using your photo as their Facebook profile photo . `` We ’ re doing this to prevent people from impersonating others on Facebook , '' Facebook says , referring to a common problem that 's more colloquially known as `` catfishing . '' If you do n't want Facebook to recognize your face , though , you 'll soon be able to disable the site 's ability to refer to your profile photos and videos for identification purposes . You wo n't be granted the same level of control over this feature as you get with Facebook 's labyrinthine privacy settings , though , as the option merely comes with a `` simple on/off switch '' that will shut down the whole feature .
For better or for worse , Facebook is everywhere these days , but the same ca n't be said of its Facebook Spaces virtual reality social platform . The service has been an exclusive for Facebook 's own Oculus Rift VR headset in its eight-month lifespan so far , but today Facebook announced that it 's letting Spaces go cross-platform . Do n't expect to be able to hop onto your PlayStation VR and try it out , however . For now , cross-platform support is limited to the HTC Vive , the Oculus Rift 's only true competitor in the high-end VR market . Neither user base is all that large , but expanding the service to a larger pool should help determine if Spaces is really what the future of social media will look like . Last summer , we were optimistic about the prospects , calling the service a `` glimpse of the true social potential of VR . '' The features across headsets remain entirely the same , much as Facebook 's regular app works the same regardless of whether you 're on iOS or Android . Users of both the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive will be able to use Spaces to make their own cartoony avatars , play games , watch 360-degree videos , enjoy photo tours or share the nifty interactive `` 3D posts '' Facebook announced a few months ago . Beyond that , a larger user base should also accurately reveal if everyday folks are keen on using Spaces as the `` digital hangout '' Facebook wants it to be , where users interact with each other with virtual avatars , much as they would in real life . ( That 's not always a wise idea , as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself discovered when he `` visited '' hurricane-stricken Puerto Rico with the service in October , reports CNBC . ) Provided you have one of the two systems , all you need to start using the service is a Facebook account . Facebook almost certainly has plans to bring Spaces to other devices , whether to the PSVR or something comparatively humble like the Samsung Gear VR system , but the timelime for these is uncertain .

Is Facebook bad for your health ? It 's a question that 's been asked many times down the years , and now Facebook itself has weighed in on the issue , admitting that just browsing other people 's posts `` may make you feel worse '' as you negatively compare your own life with those of your friends and family . On the other hand , actively interacting with other people on social media has been `` linked to improvements in well-being '' by researchers . Sharing messages and posts with close friends , and reminiscing about old times , can improve your mood , reports Facebook . `` In sum , our research and other academic literature suggests that it ’ s about how you use social media that matters when it comes to your well-being , '' say Facebook 's experts . As a result , the platform is being tweaked to encourage users to interact rather than just scrolling endlessly through the feed . Of course this is n't just a Facebook issue - other social networks work in a similar way , and Facebook 's blog post references studies that have been carried out on internet use in general . The same passive vs interactive principles can be applied to Twitter , Instagram , and other networks . Facebook points to the snooze option that it 's just introduced as one of the ways it 's looking to improve people 's social networking experience and make browsing the News Feed less of a drag on our mood . It lets you safely ignore posts from a particular person or a group you 're signed up to without anyone else being any the wiser . On top of that Facebook says it 's investing money into researching how Facebook use and screen time in general could be having a negative effect on our kids . In the meantime , maybe spend less time scrolling and more time posting on your social networks .

We all know those friends who post a little too much on Facebook : the friends who , well , treat it more like Twitter . Today , Facebook announced that it 's giving users the option of temporarily `` muting '' those folks when they get a little too giddy about a topic , and it 's calling the feature `` Snooze . '' If you 're tired of putting up with a particular person , group or page for a while , just click the menu in the upper right-hand corner of their latest post and click `` Snooze '' and you wo n't see anything from them for 30 days . The offending parties wo n't be notified . In many ways it 's a friendlier option than Facebook 's `` Unfollow '' feature , which keeps the person hidden permanently , or at least until you undo it . Maybe that type of permanent ignorance is what you crave for your bliss , but it 's often easy to forget you 've muted a person for months when you only meant to mute them while they 're releasing status updates for every single play of the World Series . It also helps fix those situations in which you do n't really want to unfollow a group , but you do n't care for getting bombarded with its commentary on whatever trendy topic is commanding its members ' attention at the moment . Viewed from the other side of the table , the groups will likely appreciate it as Snooze could mean more people will stick around in controversial times rather than outright leaving . In case you change your mind about seeing their posts again , Facebook will notify you when the Snooze period is coming to an end . And , just as with the Unfollow option , you can turn it off at any time .

Image credit : Facebook Virtual reality may be comparatively stuck in the mud for the time being , but augmented reality is in full gear . Facebook realizes this , and to that effect it has announced it ’ s bringing new Snapchat-style augmented reality features called World Effects to its Facebook Messenger app . They ’ re basically the same things as Snapchat ’ s World Lenses . The basic idea is that you can drop 3D objects into your photos to make them appear as though they ’ re there in real life , such as a heart over someone ’ s head . A bit more usefully , you could use a floating arrow to point out a specific location in a wide shot . The news accompanies the announcement that Facebook is letting the general public use its augmented reality Camera Effects Platform and AR Studio kit , which lets developers create items like “ masks ” that fit over your face in photos . It also means independent developers can make World Lenses of their own . Originally the kit was limited to just 2,000 or so entities , which led to such memorable filters such as one for Game of Thrones that made users look like the Night King or one for Star Wars that made them look like Kylo Ren . In a sense , this is Facebook ’ s way of playing catch-up with Apple and Google , both of whom released their own AR kits for developers earlier this year . Facebook is at a bit of advantage in that its kit technically works across any iOS or Android smart device , but it also suffers a bit since its third-party status keeps it from the kind of insider tricks users of Apple ’ s ARKit can use with the iPhone X . The benefits of direct camera access could be seen just yesterday in Google ’ s launch of Star Wars and Stranger Things AR “ stickers ” for its two Pixel 2 smartphones , which makes drop characters from both properties into your photos and videos .

UPDATE : In Sydney , Australia and want to get your hands on the Messenger Instant Games library in a cool , retro arcade setting ? Facebook is holding an event that 's open to the public for one day ( and night ) only ! Details below . Angry Birds and Sonic The Hedgehog are about to join Tetris in the Messenger Instant Games library that you can play within the chat app with your Facebook friends . The new games wo n't be launching until 2018 though . Angry Birds lands as a new version of the game that looks similar to the original mobile sensation , but that Messenger has confirmed will come with a `` new way to challenge friends '' . That sounds like it 'll be a score based competitive element rather than live multiplayer . An exact release date for Angry Birds on Messenger is unclear but we know it 'll be at some point in early 2018 . There 's also a series of new titles such as Sonic Jump and Disney Tsum Tsum . Sonic Jump takes elements and characters of previous titles in the superfast platforming series but repurposes them for a whole new adventure and is set to launch on Messenger in the coming weeks . That Disney Tsum Tsum game looks to be a puzzle title that will allow `` players to collect , content and pop Tsum Tsum . '' Tsum Tsum , for the uninitiated , are cute chubby soft-toy logs styled like your favorite Disney characters . Messenger is also bringing new features to Instant Games including the ability to live stream your play via Facebook Live and share it with all of your friends on your account . Then there 's also a video chat that allows you to play at the same time as seeing your friends and family too . To celebrate the 1-year anniversary of Messenger Instant Games , Facebook has opened a pop-up arcade in Sydney , Australia that gives you the chance to experience its games in a neon 80s-inspired arcade setting . If that sounds cool to you , head over to The Retro Hotel on Friday , December 8 ( that 's today ! ) between 11am-3pm or 9pm-3am ( AEST ) to get some hands on time with recent and upcoming Messenger Instant Games like Pac Man , Putt-Putt , Space Invaders and Sonic the Hedgehog . Entry to the arcade is free of charge , though you 'll have to be over 18 to get in . Sounds like a great Friday night to us !

Facebook has announced that it ’ s launching a messaging app just for kids , confirming that the days of walkie talkies and tin cans with strings are far behind us . Called Messenger Kids , the app is designed to allow users from the ages of 6 to 12 to communicate with friends and family on mobile devices without the need for any kind of phone number or Facebook account . For example , kids who have a tablet or iPod without any kind of SIM card will be able to use Messenger Kids with a WiFi connection . As it 's illegal for children under the age of 13 in the US to have a Facebook account , the Messenger Kids app won ’ t require children to set up any kind of Facebook account . Instead , it ’ ll be tied to an adult ’ s Facebook account and it ’ ll have parental controls included . Upon downloading the Messenger Kids app ( yes , it is yet another standalone Messaging app for your device ’ s storage to content with ) parents will be asked to authenticate it with their own Facebook account . After this they ’ ll be able to set up a user within the Messenger Kids app that uses their child ’ s full name . None of the details entered into the app will be publicly searchable and Facebook has confirmed that it ’ s entirely ad-free , making us only slightly envious . The parental gatekeeping doesn ’ t stop here , though - it ’ ll be up to the responsible adult to decide who their child is able to connect with on Messenger Kids as contacts are added through Facebook itself . If , for example , a child wants to message a friend from school it ’ ll be up to the parents to befriend one another on Facebook and link their children ’ s Messenger accounts . Connections have to be mutually agreed before the kids can start talking to one another . If you or any of your family members you ’ re connected with on Facebook want to message your child , it ’ s possible to do so through the ordinary Messenger app . Kids will have some controls over their Messenger account - they ’ ll be able to report and block other users ( though parents will get a notification when they do so ) and Facebook has said it has a dedicated Messenger Kids team who ’ ll look into these reports . The Messenger Kids app is fairly similar to the adult Messenger app in terms of overall interface , although it 's much brighter . It seems likely that Facebook is using the fact that children are accessing technology at much younger ages to familiarise them with Facebook applications and create something of a user pipeline . It will , after all , be natural for a child that 's been using the Messenger Kids app from the ages of 6 to 12 to create a Facebook account of their own at the age of 13 and continue to communicate with the messaging app they 're familiar with . Rather than encouraging text chat , Messenger Kids places heavy emphasis on real-time video calls which allow them to use emoji , selfie frames and stickers . Rather than taking these stickers from the main Messenger app , Facebook has created art that ’ s age-appropriate and in some cases intended to educate . The app is still in the early stages of its release and is currently in a preview-only state in the US for iOS users . Later this month it ’ ll be rolled out to Android users though there 's no word on any plans to extend the app to any more countries at the moment .

Facebook has banned all adverts for cryptocurrencies , so you won ’ t see the likes of Bitcoin or any other virtual coinage being plugged across the social network going forward . Essentially , the move has been made to protect the Facebook user base from scams which are trying to exploit the current popularity of cryptocurrencies , given the recent meteoric rise ( and fall ) of Bitcoin which has emblazoned it on the mainstream consciousness . As Recode reports , Facebook has instigated a new blanket ban policy which “ prohibits ads that promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices , such as binary options , initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency ” . That means no adverts for existing coins , from major players to more minor fish , and the aforementioned initial coin offerings or ICOs – basically the virtual coinage equivalent of an IPO , which as you can imagine , is an area fraught with potential dangers in terms of scams or hackers . Facebook notes that this policy is ‘ intentionally broad ’ to play things safe-rather-than-sorry for the moment , while the site works to refine its detection of such scam adverts . That may change in the future though , as Facebook says : “ We will revisit this policy and how we enforce it as our signals improve . ” So this might not be the end of such adverts for good , but it certainly is for the moment .

Both Google and Facebook are turning to local sources to drown out fake news , and make the stories they 're sharing with their readers more useful . Google has confirmed that it 's testing a new app called Bulletin , which lets anyone share public local news stories including text , photos and video . An official Bulletin website discovered last week describes it as `` an app for creating hyperlocal stories about your community , for your community , right from your phone . '' Google confirmed the new app in an interview with Slate . “ People everywhere want to know what is going on in their own backyard at a very local level , ranging from local bookstore readings to high school sporting events to information about local street closures , '' said spokesperson Maggie Shiels . Bulletin is currently available as a pilot in Nashville , Tennessee and Oakland , California . Anyone from these cities interested in helping test the app can request early access by creating a profile . Meanwhile , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced that the site will be putting more emphasis on local sources when deciding which news stories to show in your feed – so if there 's a local election , for example , you 'll see the results roll in from local newspapers and sites . “ Starting today , we ’ re going to show more stories from news sources in your local town or city , ” Zuckerberg said in a post on his own Facebook account . “ If you follow a local publisher or if someone shares a local story , it may show up higher in [ your ] news feed . ” The change is now being rolled out to Facebook users in the US , and the company plans to expand it to other countries later this year . Zuckerberg took the opportunity to reiterate the statement he made in his 2018 new year 's resolution , which was to make sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent , and suggested that taking a more localised approach to news might result in better quality news . `` Many people told me they thought that if we could turn down the temperature on the more divisive issues and instead focus on concrete local issues , then we 'd all make more progress together , '' he said .

Facebook has begun a huge privacy campaign in preparation for strict new EU data protection laws . The General Data Protection Legislation ( GDPU ) comes into force on May 25 , and companies breaching it face a fine of 4 % of their annual global turnover , or €20 million – whichever is higher . Facebook users in the EU will soon see a notification in their news feed prompting them to take a 'privacy check-up ' and make sure they 're comfortable with their current sharing settings . New educational videos will also appear in feeds , explaining how to delete old posts , control the data Facebook shares with advertisers , and what happens if you delete your account . In preparation for the new laws , and to coincide with Data Privacy Day , Facebook has announced seven 'privacy principles ' , which it says guide how it handles your personal information : It 's no surprise that these tie neatly with the key requirements of the GDPU : The company is also launching a new Privacy Center , as described by chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg at a company event in Brussels last week . “ Our apps have long been focused on giving people transparency and control and this gives us a very good foundation to meet all the requirements of the GDPR and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy , ” Sandberg said . Sandberg reiterated CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's admission that Facebook must do more to combat abuse , as well as interference in elections . “ The world feels anxious and divided , and Facebook has a lot to do , ” Zuckerberg said in a post on his personal account earlier this month . “ Whether it ’ s protecting our community from abuse and hate , defending against interference by nation states , or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent . ”

If you 've used an Oculus Rift headset , or sent a Facebook Messenger sticker , you 'll be fully aware of Facebook 's ambitions in both the virtual and augmented reality spheres . But new research shows it 's still looking for new ways to impress in the areas where the digital and real worlds merge . In a blog post , Facebook revealed that it is looking into ways it could not only overlay digital elements onto your face , but replace and track your entire body , whether in AR or VR scenarios . “ We recently developed a new technology that can accurately detect body poses and segment a person from their background . Our model is still in research phase at the moment , but it is only a few megabytes , and can run on smart phones in real time , ” the researchers from Facebook 's AI camera team explained . It 's that last bit that 's perhaps the most interesting element here – the fact that Facebook can get its body tracking tech to work with little memory , using only smartphone imaging and processing tech , is impressive . It 's not unique technology , but the efficiency is worth applauding , if it works consistently well . And the fact that Facebook is using neural networks to build on the reliability of the tracking means that , in time , it could continue to improve dramatically . With the team also hiring in this field , do n't be surprised if you 're soon sending full-body AR outfit clips to your pals through Facebook 's apps .

Facebook has announced a new exclusive streaming deal with ESL – one of the world 's biggest esports leagues . As ESL 's main broadcast partner , Facebook will stream Dota 2 and Counter Strike : Global Offensive competitions from ESL One , as well as its dedicated CS : GO Pro League . The streaming action starts right now with ESL One Genting 2018 . The tournament runs from January 23-28 , with Dota 2 players competing for a US $ 400,000 prize pool . “ For years ESL has used Facebook to nurture its global community while broadening the audience for esports competition to millions of fans worldwide , ” said Leo Olebe , global director of Facebook Games Partnerships at ESL . “ Having two of ESL ’ s most adored properties for CS : GO and Dota 2 streaming exclusively on Facebook is the next step in our efforts to delight the passionate esports community on Facebook . '' The Facebook deal also introduces the possibility of virtual reality streaming for ESL 's tournaments – a move that could give it an edge over the two biggest names in esports streaming : Twitch and YouTube Gaming . `` The ability to now watch esports in 1080p and in VR underscores our commitment to adding more ways for fans to watch and connect with each other around the esports content they love most , '' said Olebe . In March , Facebook Live made the jump from mobile devices to the desktop , letting users stream video directly from PCs and laptops . It was a natural move towards game streaming , but until now it 's been an exclusively amateur affair . The ESL deal makes Facebook a serious contender for the attention of esports fans , and it 'll be interesting to see if other professional leagues follow suit . Via The Verge

Last year , Facebook pledged to spend $ 1 billion in 2018 on original content for its ( still US-only ) Netflix and YouTube competitor , Facebook Watch . The social network has kept to its word and commissioned its first new series of the year from Blumhouse Productions ( Get Out , The Purge ) and two key members from the team behind HBO 's True Blood . The 10-part half-hour series , titled Sacred Lies , has been announced at the National Association of Television Program Executives ( NATPE ) conference by Facebook ’ s director of development and co-founder of CollegeHumor , Ricky Van Veen . As reported by Deadline , Sacred Lies will be based in part on the fairy-tale The Handless Maiden by the Brothers Grimm , as well as the Stephanie Oaks novel The Sacred Lies of Minnow Bly . Deadline says the show `` is about a handless teen who escapes from a cult and finds herself in juvenile detention . '' Former True Blood executive producer Raelle Tucker will act as showrunner with Scott Winant , also from True Blood , directing the first two episodes . The series is now in its casting phase . Needless to say , the show will be much darker and more fantastical than the reality-focused content currently streaming on Facebook Watch . “ Raelle and Scott are known for pushing the envelope with complex characters , mixing genres and diving into dramatically dark subjects , which is also a hallmark of Blumhouse storytelling , ” said Blumhouse Television co-presidents , Marci Wiseman and Jeremy Gold . Tucker , who is currently an executive producer on Marvel 's Jessica Jones , promises `` a young female protagonist we ’ ve never seen on screen before , ” describing the handless character as `` complex , brave , funny…and sometimes dangerous . '' No projected release date has been given , though we 'll bring you more details as they arrive .

Facebook has been loading more and more features into Messenger , so much so that there are probably a few Messenger tricks you did n't even know about . But , feature creep can be a real problem , especially for a tool with one simple goal : allowing people to communicate . Fortunately , Facebook should be scaling things back a bit this year . Facebook 's head of Messenger , David Marcus , wrote a post discussing the app and its future . In it , he admits that with so many features added in a short time span , Messenger has gotten a bit cluttered . While we raced to build these new features , the app became too cluttered . Expect to see us invest in massively simplifying and streamlining Messenger this year . This does n't mean that Facebook is going to start taking away features that it has added . Instead , the focus on streamlining will likely mean making it easier to do whatever it is you want on Messenger , cutting out extra steps . Marcus 's post expressed extra emphasis on visual messaging with video ( especially with augmented reality ) , images , GIFs and stickers , so some of that streamlining is bound to show up in connection with these features . Let 's just hope all the streamlining is n't to make room for more ads in Messenger .

I can ’ t remember the last time I had a meaningful interaction on Facebook . Messenger , sure - if a friend can not be contacted in any other way , I may resort to Facebook ’ s relatively uncluttered instant chat service . But within the News Feed , that once-so-alluring torrent of thoughts , feelings , comment and action that had made the early years of Facebook so addictive and seemingly revolutionary ? That ’ s gone . That ’ s dead . And it ’ s not been for want of trying on Facebook ’ s part – on a semi-regular basis it has tweaked and reworked the News Feed in an attempt to better represent your friendships , as publishers and advertisers increasingly over the years encroached on the core communicative value of the early Facebook model . In 2016 it made behind-the-scenes changes that were designed to favor posts from pals over publishers and pages owned by businesses . And before that , in 2015 , when fan pages for all manner of things were becoming increasingly pushy on Facebook , it cut the reach of those encroaching elements too . Multiple times over the years then it claims to have addressed the balance of its News Feed scroll , between its business needs and the online relationships you now have with your real-world friends . Look back to 2013 for the first major Facebook overhaul , a time where we all feared that a change to its lightning-in-a-bottle alchemy would ruin its ability to support real world friendships . We were right , and as a result , from once fearing News Feed changes , we now desperately desire them , in an attempt to restore some faith in its ability to enrich the relationships it once elevated . Facebook has a broken image of what I personally want to see , and thus who I truly am . These are the very relationships that Facebook has , knowingly or otherwise , disfigured , eroding the physical , in-depth conversations and meetings that some of us perhaps didn ’ t know could ever be lost - or at least be twisted by the pervasive micro-validations and dopamine drops of Likes and comment counts . But did you truly ever notice a difference following these algorithmic or policy-shifting tweaks ? Certainly publishers did – all but the most powerful of Facebook pages have seen their reach decline significantly unless pulling feats of social media engineering gymnastics so wild that Facebook itself could barely anticipate them . That return to discussion , to interaction – was that ever really achieved again ? All I see is autoplaying cat videos , and lad Lad LAD culture clips . If Facebook ’ s built its business on knowing us , it certainly now has a broken image of what I personally want to see , and thus who I truly am . Which is what makes Facebook ’ s latest admission that something ’ s not quite right , and the promises that accompany that capitulation , ring so hollow . The company now states that it ’ s again revising its service , pushing active discussion rather than passively parsed content – a return , in theory at least , to its roots . Facebook ’ s Adam Mosseri , head of News Feed , described some of the changes it ’ s anticipating making . “ We will predict which posts you might want to interact with your friends about , and show these posts higher in feed , ” said Mosseri . “ These are posts that inspire back-and-forth discussion in the comments and posts that you might want to share and react to - whether that ’ s a post from a friend seeking advice , a friend asking for recommendations for a trip , or a news article or video prompting lots of discussion . ” We ’ ve heard all of this before . So what makes this time any different ? Perhaps , for the first time , there ’ s an outside scrutiny that Facebook wants to listen to - and perhaps , a sense of reactionary movement that could be read as defensive as opposed to philanthropic . Whether it ’ s CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’ s latent presidential goals driving the PR offensive , or it ’ s the result of genuine soul searching , some of the accusations that have been levelled at Facebook in the past year seem to have hit harder than those that landed before . Former employees speaking candidly of their fears that they ’ ve helped create something which damages rather than enriches lives . Also the growing evidence that Facebook was manipulated covertly for dubious political motives on the world stage , influencing elections and referendums , and giving platform to some of the most vile kinds of hate speech and bullying . Zuckerberg and company would have to be truly cold to not be moved by some of the issues being raised . It ’ s impossible to create a service that can be tailored to the individual idiosyncrasies , fears , loves , anxieties , desires and hopes of all . “ We feel a responsibility to make sure our services aren ’ t just fun to use , but also good for people ’ s well-being , ” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a post . “ By making these changes , I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down . But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable . And if we do the right thing , I believe that will be good for our community and our business over the long term too . ” There ’ s a heartening honesty to that last exchange , the admission that the very engagement metrics that Facebook ’ s whole business model relies upon could be shook to the core . But there ’ s now an inherent problem of being part of a service , policed and nurtured only by a few thousand employees , that literally serves more than a billion people - it ’ s impossible to create a service that can be tailored to the individual idiosyncrasies , fears , loves , anxieties , desires and hopes of all . We ’ ve already seen the damage being caused by things such as ‘ fake news ’ . Facebook has gone some way to remedy this with scores of fact checkers . But it would be remiss to not correlate this latest move with the fact that fewer pieces going up by publishers will mean fewer things to actually fact check , taking away a pain point that Facebook caused in the first place . And that ’ s perhaps the takeaway lesson - if we can ’ t trust the filter through which our online relationships are now forced through , perhaps it ’ s now time to switch off for good . It ’ s time for less Facebook , and more face-to-face .

Facebook Messenger Kids is now available on the US Amazon Appstore for Amazon Fire tablets . Facebook Messenger Kids is specially designed for children under 13 , who are too young to have their own Facebook account . It lets them send messages and hold video calls with a list of contacts approved by their parents . Parents must download the app to their kid 's phone , authenticate the device with their own Facebook account , and set up a profile with the child 's full name . Contacts can only be added to the app via Facebook itself , so it 's up to parents to decide who their kids can speak to . If a child wants to speak to one of their classmates , for example , their parents have to link the two Messenger Kids accounts on Facebook itself . The connection has to be mutually agreed before the kids can start talking . Adult friends and family members can use the regular Facebook Messenger to chat with youngsters on Facebook Messenger Kids , provided the link has been approved by the parents . Facebook Messenger Kids accounts are n't publicly searchable , and the app does n't display ads or gather data for advertisers . A version of the app for Android devices is expected at the end of January . Via TechCrunch

Facebook is entering the world of hardware manufacture with an Amazon Echo Show rival called Portal . That ’ s if anonymous sources close to the project are to be believed . Speaking to Cheddar , sources claimed that Facebook Portal will be a chat device with a screen so that users can stay connected with their family and friends using video chat and “ other social features ” . It is interesting that this information has come to light during CES 2018 , when a number of Google Assistant-powered smart speakers with screens have been introduced to the market . Now , it ’ s not only the Echo Show ( and let ’ s not forget the Echo Spot ) that Portal will have to go up against , but a whole range of smart speakers from third-party manufacturers like with the JBL Link View . According to the sources , Portal won ’ t be a traditional smart speaker , and that ’ s not totally surprising given that Facebook – for the time being – doesn ’ t have a voice assistant like Alexa or Cortana that it could use in a ‘ traditional ’ smart speaker . That doesn ’ t mean that the possibility of controlling your smart home is completely out of the question though . This is purely speculation , but looking at the fact that companies like Netatmo are starting to use Facebook Messenger to control smart home products , it ’ s not beyond the realm of reason to think that Portal could have some home hub capabilities . We ’ d also be very surprised if that screen ended up only being used for social activities , too . Given Facebook ’ s foray into video content with Watch , we ’ re expecting this content to find a home on Portal as well . When we first heard the rumors about this device , it seemed like we were going to see it early 2018 . What ’ s looking more likely now is that it ’ s going to be officially announced in May , with a release later in the year . And the price ? $ 499 . Ouch . According to those anonymous sources : “ CEO Mark Zuckerberg has told employees that he doesn ’ t care if the device generates profit but rather wants it to change user behavior and encourage phone-like usage among owners . ”

European smart home manufacturer Netatmo has used CES 2018 to unveil its new way to control your smart home : Facebook Messenger . By texting Netatmo ’ s dedicated Smart Home Bot , you can request that your heating be turned up , your lights turned on , and even an update on who ’ s currently in your home . The new feature uses natural language processing to respond to text requests as if you were having an actual conversation with your home . While the process of talking to your home as a sentient being may not be a new thing , for many , interacting with a voice assistant ( think Alexa , Google Assistant ) is still an unusual or disruptive thing . If you ’ re in the middle of a film and want to turn the heating up , you don ’ t want to shout at your Amazon Echo and ruin everyone ’ s movie-viewing experience . The ability to send a message on Facebook Messenger allows for a more discreet mode of operation and means you ’ re potentially less likely to be misunderstood . The feature works with all the Netatmo range that currently includes security cameras Presence and Welcome , a Thermostat , Weather Station , and an air quality monitor called Home Coach . Additionally , there ’ s a new range of products coming in 2018 that bear the 'with Netatmo ' branding that you 'll be able to control using the Smart Home Bot , including smart lights , blinds , and radiators . This isn ’ t the first time that you ’ ve been able to control your smart home by text , as smart home hub Homey has a Facebook Messenger function very similar to Netatmo ’ s Smart Home Bot , and LG has HomeChat which uses a dedicated app , but seeing a major player in the smart home market introduce the feature could mark the start of Messenger as a smart home control . With the range of products in the smart home market constantly expanding , one of the biggest challenges for the smart home in 2018 is going to be a unifying way of controlling all the different devices in our homes in one easy interface . It will be interesting to see which anthropomorphised smart home entity ends up being on top .

Mark Zuckerberg has made a modest new year ’ s resolution : to fix Facebook and make the world a better place . “ The world feels anxious and divided , and Facebook has a lot to do , ” the CEO said in a post on his personal account . “ Whether it ’ s protecting our community from abuse and hate , defending against interference by nation states , or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent . ” It ’ s a sharp change of direction since 2016 , when Zuckerberg dismissed the idea that hoax news stories shared on Facebook could have influenced the outcome of the US presidential election . Speaking at the annual Techonomy conference near San Francisco , the CEO called the notion a “ pretty crazy idea ” . The world feels anxious and divided , and Facebook has a lot to do “ There is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news , ” he said in an on-stage interview . Zuckerberg retracted the statement in 2017 following a tweet in which President Trump claimed Facebook had a specific agenda against him . In a post published in September , he vowed to “ keep working to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world , and to ensure our community is a platform for all ideas and a force for good in democracy . ” After the election , Facebook identified at least 470 fake pages and accounts that had spent a total of $ 100,000 on ads . In a statement , the company said these accounts were likely to be linked and probably originated in Russia . Facebook turned the ads over to US Congress investigators , noting that although they did n't seem to reference a specific candidate , they were designed to spread divisive messages on sensitive topics such as gun rights . Elliot Schrage , vice president of policy and communications at Facebook , said the company did n't act immediately because “ [ T ] here was nothing necessarily noteworthy at the time about a foreign actor running an ad involving a social issue . '' International organisations , for example , might run an ad addressing women ’ s rights or encouraging charity donations . Only after the election , Schrange said , did Facebook notice some auto-approved ads might be “ problematic ” . Following these revelations , Facebook vowed to employ over 1,000 extra staff to review advertising , and invest in machine learning to identify and remove ads that violate its policies . It also said it would require more thorough documentation from advertisers placing political ads on the site Keen to show that it had learned from past mistakes , the company worked with German officials to avoid interference during the country 's general election in September . Although it admitted it could n't have eliminated any false news stories from appearing in news feeds , it worked with legitimate news agencies and the political parties themselves to help minimize the chances of such content rising to the surface . Until now , Zuckerberg ’ s `` personal challenges '' have been just that – personal . They began with the humble ambition of wearing a tie to work every day in 2009 “ to signal to everyone at work that this was a serious year for us ” during the global recession . In 2016 he set himself the challenge of building an AI to run his home and running 365 miles . This year 's resolution shows a change of focus , showing the CEO taking Facebook 's influential position seriously . With presidential and general elections taking place in Italy , Ireland , Sweden and many other nations during 2018 , that commitment will soon be put to the test .

Facebook may be favored more by grandparents than teens these days , but the social network is taking steps to keep its interface innovative . After announcing plans to allow 3D objects in Facebook posts at last year 's Oculus Connect conference , Facebook is finally showing off the technology in action . LEGO , Jurassic Park , Sony , Wayfair and other brands all released posts today with embedded , rotatable 3D objects . Facebook Product Manager Aykud Gönen said in a blog post the 3D objects use “ industry-standard gITF 2.0 ” formatting , and that artists will be able to directly drag and drop 3D images into Facebook posts . This means easier sharing of even richer , more varied 3D content , Gönen said . With the 3D Connect app on your Sony Xperia XZ1 , XZ1 Compact or XZ Premium phone , you ’ ll also be able to snap 3D photos , then post them directly to your Facebook News Feed . Sony is just one of Facebook ’ s first partners , and other apps will be able to easily use the tools to enable 3D sharing support . While Facebook users with 3D-enabled camera phones will no doubt use this technology , brands like Wayfair and LEGO can also now show off their products at every angle . Until 3D posts become the norm , they will definitely catch the attention of users that typically scroll past ads without a thought . Facebook , meanwhile , has already said that it wants Facebook Spaces users to post their silly 3D creations online , and will no doubt enable Oculus Rift users to post to Facebook without having to take off their headsets . The end goal , Gönen said , is “ enabling interactive animations and bringing 3D content into the real world using AR. ” That last part is especially intriguing : Facebook 's rumored AR glasses would certainly benefit from a large library of 3D models that could be projected into reality .

As part of its ongoing effort to clean up its reputation , Facebook will soon start using old-school paper postcards to verify the location of anyone buying ads related to US elections . The postcards will include a unique code , which advertisers will need in order to prove they are in the country . The codes will be necessary for anyone who wants to place an ad mentioning a candidate running for Congress . It 's illegal for foreign nationals to donate or spend money in connection with federal , state or local elections in the United States . Katie Habarth , Facebook ’ s global director of policy programs , told Reuters the postcards `` wo n't solve everything '' , but were the best method for preventing such meddling in future . Late last year , Facebook identified at least 470 fake pages and accounts , which had spent a total of US $ 100,000 on ads . In a statement , the company said the accounts were linked to one another and probably originated in Russia . These ads did n't mention particular candidates , and therefore would n't be covered by the new verification system , but Facebook concluded that they were meant to spread divisive messages on sensitive topics such as gun rights . “ The world feels anxious and divided , and Facebook has a lot to do “ Facebook expects the new system to be in place before the mid-term Congressional elections in September , but has n't mentioned electoral ads in any other countries . The announcement comes a month after Facebook 's CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that political interference was a real problem on the network , and made a commitment to tackling it . “ The world feels anxious and divided , and Facebook has a lot to do , ” Zuckerberg said . “ Whether it ’ s protecting our community from abuse and hate , defending against interference by nation states , or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent . ” Via TechCrunch

Two months after its launch on iOS , Facebook has released a version of its child-friendly chat app Messenger Kids for Android devices . The app is currently only available in the US , where it can be downloaded free from the Google Play Store . Messenger Kids is designed specifically for children under 13 to chat with friends and family . A parent must install the app on their child ’ s phone , authenticate it with their own Facebook account and create a list of contacts . If two children want to chat using Messenger Kids , they must both have parental approval to connect their accounts . It ’ s possible to chat via text using Messenger Kids , but the app puts heavy emphasis on real-time video calls , with age-appropriate filters and stickers to liven things up – and no ads . “ Messenger Kids is a messaging app that helps parents and children to chat in a safer way , with parents always in control of their child ’ s contacts and who they can message , ” a Messenger spokesperson told TechRadar “ Since we launched in December we ’ ve heard from parents around the United States that Messenger Kids has helped them stay in touch with their children and has enabled their children to video chat with fun masks with family members near and far . `` For example , we ’ ve heard stories of parents working night shifts being able read bedtime stories to their children , and moms who travel for work getting daily updates from their kids while they 're away . “ We worked to create Messenger Kids with an advisory committee of parenting and developmental experts , as well as with families themselves . We continue to be focused on making Messenger Kids be the best experience it can be for families . We have been very clear that there is no advertising in Messenger Kids . ” It ’ s still early days for the app , and Facebook is keen to point out that it ’ s very attentive to parents ’ feedback , which you can give via its feedback form .

Bargain-priced “ Smart speakers ” like Amazon ’ s Echo and Echo Dot , along with Google Home Mini , have found their way into one of six American households . Now , based on a report from Digitimes , Facebook may be looking to jump into the smart speaker war—up until now dominated Amazon and Google—with two devices focused more on the luxury crowd , developed by their Building 8 division and slated for release by July 2018 . Codenamed “ Aloha ” and “ Fiona ” , these devices will launch with 15-inch touchscreens built by LG Display—more than doubling the Echo Show ’ s screen size . They will support voice commands , and will focus on “ video chat ” and other unnamed “ social networking functions ” . Aloha is reportedly the nickname for Facebook ’ s Portal , a $ 499 speaker that was first rumored last month during CES 2018 , and will be an upgrade over “ Fiona ” . One such upgrade is that Portal will come bundled with a “ wide-angle lens ” capable of video calls and , Digitimes claims , facial recognition capable of logging users into Facebook instantly . Bloomberg first announced rumors of these devices last August , and said Facebook would bundle them with a “ Siri-style voice assistant ” . But based on our Portal report last month , those plans might be scrapped ; those sources claimed Portal would not be a “ traditional ” smart speaker with an Alexa equivalent . Portal doubles the Echo Show ’ s screen size , but it will do the same to the Echo ’ s price tag . Will consumers want to shell out that kind of cash for this smart speaker/tablet hybrid ? Our Echo Show review felt the devices limited video call options and poor audio quality were definite cons . That said , we ’ ll have to get our hands on the Portal to see how it compares in those areas . The Digitimes report claims they pushed the Portal and `` Fiona '' launch back two months to `` perfect the acoustic quality '' . Even CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly isn ’ t sure how Portal will compete in a competitive speaker market , but sources claim he “ doesn ’ t care if the device generates profit ” . Instead , he “ wants [ Portal ] to change user behavior and encourage phone-like usage among owners . ” Speculating on that user behavior change isn ’ t too difficult . More and more people are relying on voice assistants for their everyday needs , which pushes a lot of people towards staying in one tech ecosystem—say , only using devices that can link to a Google Assistant , or services easily accessed through Alexa . Facebook wants you to keep using their products , and may see jumping into the speaker hardware game as the best way to stay relevant as a primary source of information and services . If the Portal is your main home device , for example , you may use their fledgling Watch service more than YouTube , or Messenger to video call instead of FaceTime . Facebook could even enable you to use Messenger to control your smart home products .

Facebook is shaking up the way it presents news . You ’ ll soon be able to keep up with breaking news via Facebook Watch , but you ’ ll also start seeing less news on your newsfeed . The announcement came at the Recode Code Media conference in California , where Adam Mosseri , Facebook ’ s head of newsfeed , and Campbell Brown , head of news partnerships , discussed what the future holds for news on the network . Newsfeed will go from about 5 % news to about 4 % news Mosseri reiterated Facebook 's plan to reduce the amount of general news stories appearing in newsfeeds , thereby ( hopefully ) showing more of the posts from friends and family that you 'll actually be interested in . `` That creates a real downward pressure on the distribution for publishers , including news publishers , '' he said . `` We said that , publicly , we think that roughly over the next couple of months , newsfeed will go from about 5 % news to about 4 % news , which is a meaningful drop . '' `` This is not about us stepping back from news , '' said Brown . `` This is about us changing our relationship with publishers and emphasising something that Facebook has never done before . It 's having a point of view and it 's leaning into quality news . I think we would agree that not all news is created equal `` We are , for the first time in the history of Facebook , taking a step to try to define what quality news looks like and give that a boost so that , overall , there 's less competition from news . `` I think we would agree that not all news is created equal , and this is a big step for us to begin thinking about that . '' Last month , Facebook announced that it 's experimenting with giving locally sourced news greater priority in newsfeeds , helping drown out divisive news stories with information that ’ s more likely to be relevant and useful . “ Starting today , we ’ re going to show more stories from news sources in your local town or city , ” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on his own Facebook account . “ If you follow a local publisher or if someone shares a local story , it may show up higher in [ your ] news feed . ” Facebook is also making big investments in Watch . The on-demand video platform launched last year , and unlike Facebook Live , which lets anyone broadcast videos , it specializes in original content produced by partners . Last month Facebook announced an exclusive partnership deal with ESL , one of the world ’ s biggest esports leagues . The deal kicked off with live broadcasts of the ESL One Genting DOTA 2 tournament on Facebook Watch , and the two companies are looking into the possibility of streaming future competitions in VR .
Facebook has added a new option to its mobile app which points users to download Onavo Protect , in order to push this VPN service – which it bought up some five years back – although the social network ’ s motives appear quite different to the traditional VPN provider . First off , let ’ s clarify that this is happening according to TechCrunch , which spotted the new ‘ Protect ’ option over in the US , on Facebook ’ s iOS app only ( not Android ) . As the site observes , this may mean the social network is only testing the feature at this point with a limited user base over in the States . ( Onavo has also been previously pushed in testing over in the UK ) . If you click on Protect in the navigation menu , you ’ ll get taken straight through to the App Store listing for the ‘ Onavo Protect – VPN Security ’ product , which you can obviously install from there . On the face of it , like any other VPN product , Onavo is designed to keep you more secure online by encrypting the data you transmit over your internet connection ( or indeed someone else ’ s connection , like public Wi-Fi which is potentially insecure ) . VPNs are also traditionally designed to maintain your anonymity and privacy online , but notably in Onavo Protect ’ s store listing , there ’ s no talk of privacy . Instead , the app blurb states : “ To provide this [ protection ] , Onavo uses a VPN to establish a secure connection to direct all of your network communications through Onavo ’ s servers . As part of this process , Onavo collects your mobile data traffic . “ This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analyzing your use of websites , apps and data . Because we 're part of Facebook , we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services , gain insights into the products and services people value , and build better experiences . ” In other words , rather than maintaining your privacy , the app is making use of the data you send across the VPN connection to provide insights to Facebook on what its users are doing online . Exactly how Facebook is using this data obviously isn ’ t clear , although TechCrunch theorizes that the social network could employ it to see which rival apps are swiftly gaining popularity – for potential early acquisitions – or which features of other apps are working well ( because it can see how many of its users are flocking to them ) . That ’ s all speculation , but what isn ’ t speculation is that if you use this Onavo VPN , you are signing up to let Facebook use your data for its own insights , whatever they may be . And Facebook is obviously wanting to push this VPN via its mobile app , although as mentioned at the outset , it ’ s not clear whether this is just limited testing on the iOS platform at the moment . We ’ ll just have to wait and see to get more of a handle on whether this is still a case of dipping toes in the water , or a more full-on push to drive installations of Onavo Protect to Facebook users . As ever , with any app you download , you should carefully read the product description and any other relevant info such as permissions , before you go ahead with installation . There are , of course , plenty of other free VPNs out there if you ’ re looking for alternatives , although the whole area can be something of a minefield given that providers of freebie services have to turn a profit somehow – which has led to some hair-raising accusations in the past . So tread carefully , or get yourself a paid VPN .

Facebook is going grey , losing its teen audience and gaining popularity among over-55s . Less than half of internet users between the ages of 12 and 17 will use Facebook regularly in 2018 , according to forecasts by eMarketer . Unlike previous years , when the site managed to hang onto younger users via Instagram , it now seems to be losing serious ground to Snapchat . eMarketer predicts that the number of US Facebook users under 12 ( below the minimum age for registering on the site ) will drop by 9.3 % this year , while the number of users between 12 and 17 , and 18 and 24 will decrease by 5.6 % and 5.8 % respectively . Meanwhile , more over-55s are signing up , with half a million new users expected to join by the end of the year . That might come as unwelcome news to Facebook , which had its sights set firmly on the next generation of users . In December it launched Messenger Kids – a version of its instant messaging and video chat app designed specifically for kids too young for Facebook itself . Pre-teens can only use the app to communicate with people to a list created and approved by a parent , but once they reach 13 they ’ ll be familiar enough with the site to make their own account . Facebook also offers to work with schools to bring online safety lessons into the classroom . This is a sensible move to help kids learn how to protect themselves , but also helps raise the site 's profile among school kids . Facebook is also pouring investment into new technologies like advanced AR and VR , including full-body tracking – tools that might be of less interest to older users . Via the Guardian

As part of its continuing effort to clean up its platform and its reputation , Facebook has started testing an experimental downvote option . The new tool is n't a thumbs-down button for 'disliking ' a particular post . Instead it 's intended to improve the quality of comments on public posts by letting users downvote anything offensive , misleading or off-topic . A Facebook representative confirmed to the Verge that the downvote link is currently being tested among a small selection of US-based users who began sharing screen grabs on Twitter yesterday . Facebook added emoji reactions to Messenger last year , including a thumbs-down reaction not available in Facebook itself , but there seem to be no plans to let users actively 'dislike ' posts in their news feed . It 's been a busy time for Facebook , which came under close scrutiny after revealing that over 470 fake accounts and pages had paid for ads designed to rile up readers by spreading divisive messages . After the revelation , CEO Mark Zuckerberg vowed to crack down on hate speech and abuse on the site , dedicating his new year 's resolution to `` making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent '' . As part of this move , Facebook is experimenting with settings that put more emphasis on local sources in users ' news feeds . `` Many people told me they thought that if we could turn down the temperature on the more divisive issues and instead focus on concrete local issues , then we 'd all make more progress together , '' he said .

In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal , Facebook has temporarily suspended approval of new third-party apps . It announced the news on its developer blog , providing an overall update on the measures it 's taking `` to maintain the trust people place in Facebook '' . The data used by Cambridge Analytica was gathered using a personality testing app called thisisyourdigitallife . The app not only collected information about the person who took the test , but also about their friends , who had n't consented to it . Facebook put an end to that practice in 2014 , but Cambridge Analytica kept the data it had gathered and continued to use it to provide targeted advertising . The decision to suspend approval of new apps comes a week after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg set out a plan to take better care of users ' data in future , and hunt down any other third parties behaving in a similar way . `` We are doing a set of things to restrict the amount of access that developers can get going forward , but the other [ thing ] is that we need to make sure that there are n't any other Cambridge Analyticas out there , or folks who have improperly accessed data , '' Zuckerberg said . Facebook has also permanently shut down Partner Categories – a scheme that let advertisers target their ads more precisely by supplementing their own data with information from third-party brokers that collect information about consumers from offline sources like supermarket loyalty cards . Cambridge Analytica was n't involved in Partner Categories , but this is a sign that Facebook is taking a broad look at how it handles users ' data more generally . Via the Verge

In a new blog post , Facebook has announced that it ’ s overhauling its security and privacy settings to make it easier for people to see and control the data they ’ re sharing with the social network . This is an unsurprising announcement following the recent data harvesting scandal around Cambridge Analytica , which has resulted in apologies , investigations and a smart speaker delay . Though Facebook insists that the changes were already in the works due to the GDPR ’ s upcoming reform of EU data protection rules , this blog post does acknowledge the damage the Cambridge Analytica revelations have caused to the company ’ s reputation . “ The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies , and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data , ” writes Chief Privacy Officer , Erin Egan . “ We 've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find , and that we must do more to keep people informed . ” The changes have been broken down into three categories : a cleaner and easier to use settings UI , a new privacy shortcuts menu , and new tools for tracking and editing the data you share . The settings menu has been redesigned to make information easier to find and accessible from one place . You can see below how the new settings page looks compared to the old one ; the sections are now regrouped and far more descriptive . The new privacy shortcuts menu gives more streamlined access to the most important facets of account security . Here you ’ ll be able to activate two-factor authentication , control you personal information , control which ads you see , and manage who sees your posts and profile information . Finally , the new data management tools . These can be found on a new page called Access your Information and it ’ s here you ’ ll be able to review your past interactions on the site such as likes and comments and have the option to delete them . Facebook says it ’ s also making it easier to download the data you ’ ve shared , such as images , contacts and posts in order to keep a secure copy . It ’ s believable that this change has been in the works for a while given the new GDPR rules comes into play from May 25 . The timing of the announcement , however , is significant and likely tactical . As far as the future in concerned , Facebook says that in `` the coming weeks '' it will be proposing terms of service changes as well as updating its data policy for more transparency around what data is taken and how it 's used . With user trust in decline , widespread calls for deletion and large companies pulling away from the service , Facebook needs to be seen to be doing something other than apologizing . Whether this will be enough remains to be seen .
You wo n't see Facebook 's smart home speaker unveiled at its F8 conference on May 1 due to public outrage over its privacy practices , according to a new report today . In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica user data scandal , the social media giant is delaying its connected speaker with digital-assistant and video-chat capabilities , notes Bloomberg , citing people familiar with the matter . Facebook 's smart speaker hardware is said to still be coming this year and it was n't poised to launch until later in 2018 – just previewed at F8 . It may still be on track , even if the official unveiling has been shifted . Interestingly , today 's report mentions focus-group testing already showed that a Facebook-branded device in the living room sparked concern . It sounds as if the testing was done before the Cambridge Analytica story broke . With CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologizing to users and and ready to testify in front of US Congress , the controversy does n't seem to be going away any time soon . Facebook is also under investigation by US regulators . That 's going to be a sizable hurdle for Facebook 's smart home speaker , previously rumored to include a camera and 15-inch touchscreen that doubles the size of the Amazon Echo Show display . That 's going to be a tough sell in the current 'deleteFacebook'-happy climate when the Apple HomePod , Google Home , and Amazon Echo are more familiar and infinitely less controversial sounding .

In the midst of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal , Mozilla has released a Firefox extension that effectively sandboxes Facebook . It does n't prevent third-party apps from collecting your data , but it does make it harder for the social network to use cookies to track your online activity . When you install Facebook Container , the extension will start by deleting the cookie that keeps you logged into Facebook . Next time you visit the site , it will appear in a blue-highlighted tab and you can log back in as normal . Following a link from Facebook to a different site will cause it to open in a new tab outside the container , and clicking Share buttons on other sites will open them within the container . Bear in mind that these buttons pass information about the site you arrived from to Facebook . Because you 're only logged into Facebook within the container , sites and apps that require you to log in using your account wo n't work . Neither will embedded Facebook comments or Like buttons on other sites . Mozilla is one of several companies that have suspended advertising on Facebook following the news that data analysis company Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from 50 million people without permission . We are encouraged that Mark Zuckerberg has promised to improve the privacy settings and make them more protective , '' Mozilla said in a statement on its company blog . `` When Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares customer data , specifically strengthening its default privacy settings for third-party apps , we ’ ll consider returning .

A US regulatory agency has confirmed it 's investigating Facebook following the Cambridge Analytica ( CA ) data scandal . The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) was already reported to be investigating Facebook following revelations that data from 50 million users was used by CA to develop software that predicted those users voting patterns . Additionally , this information was reportedly used to generate micro-targeted ads with the aim of influencing US voters ' decisions at the polls . With today 's announcement , the FTC is making its investigation official . `` ... the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook , '' the FTC 's statement reads . `` Today , the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices . '' In its statement , the FTC notes one of the tools in its arsenal to protect consumer privacy is `` enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises ... or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act . '' The agency also says that , `` Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements . '' A 2011 settlement with the FTC required Facebook to improve its privacy settings so that third parties could n't acquire user data without their express knowledge or consent . In today 's statement , the FTC alludes to the fact that Facebook may have violated the terms of the 2011 settlement . Facebook could face a fine of $ 40,000 per violation of the settlement , which would be a substantial sum if multiplied by 50 million . The FTC is n't the only regulatory body looking into the scandal . Just a few days ago , officials from the British Information Commissioner 's Office searched Cambridge Analytica 's London offices as part of the agency 's larger investigation into Facebook , according to Reuters . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone on the defensive in the wake of the CA revelations , appearing on news programs and taking out full-page newspaper ads over the weekend to say `` sorry '' for breaching user trust . We 'll have to wait and see what the FTC 's investigation turns up , but this scandal is n't going away for Facebook anytime soon .
Facebook is in more than just a spot of bother , and the troubled social network is once again on the defensive after claims were made that it has been scraping your call and SMS history for years via its Messenger and Facebook Lite apps . However , Facebook states that `` this is not the case . `` . In a public post on its newsroom , the social network gets straight to the point : `` You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people 's call and SMS ( text ) history without their permission . `` This is not the case . '' The reports it speaks of include an article by Ars Technica which highlighted the possibility that Facebook is harvesting call and SMS data without permission , and the site claims that the firm 's response does n't fully align with its own findings . While the feature records when you contact a friend , Facebook is clear that it does n't read what messages contain . `` We never sell this data , and this feature does not collect the content of your text messages or calls . '' If you 're not sure whether you 're uploading your call and SMS data to Facebook , jump into the Messenger app and check your settings . It 's not immediately obvious where you need to tap in the app to find the settings , but it 's the icon of your profile picture in the top right of the screen . From here you 'll find the `` SMS '' option - give it a tap and make sure the slider is in the `` off '' position . Select `` People '' and you 'll be able to see whether or not you 've synced your contacts to Facebook . If you do n't want this is happen any more , you can turn sync off . You may also want to visit this page to manage/delete contacts that have already been uploaded to the social network .
It took a while , but Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence on the Cambridge Analytica scandal a few days ago and posted a response on his Facebook page saying , `` We have a responsibility to protect your data , and if we ca n't then we do n't deserve to serve you . '' While the online response didn ’ t quite sound like an apology , the social media giant has moved offline to do just that . On Sunday , multiple newspapers across the UK and the US had full-page adverts signed by Zuckerberg to say `` sorry '' for the `` breach of trust '' and for `` not doing more at the time '' . `` We ’ re now taking steps to ensure this doesn ’ t happen again , '' read the ads published in the UK ’ s The Observer , The Sunday Times , Mail on Sunday , Sunday Mirror , Sunday Express and Sunday Telegraph , as well as in The New York Times , Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal in the US . Full page apology from the @ facebook boss in many British newspapers today # cambridgeanalytica pic.twitter.com/z6EG5u6PgwMarch 25 , 2018 Social media users , however , aren ’ t buying it : many have pointed out that the apology would have been more convincing if the company hadn ’ t threatened to file a lawsuit against reporters who broke the story earlier this month . This would be convincing if they had n't threatened to bring a lawsuit against the reporters who broke the story . https : //t.co/bifHzQYzRBMarch 25 , 2018 The scandal has caused Facebook ’ s stock prices to plunge , leaving Zuckerberg to promise `` to do better for you '' . The social media platform has already stopped third-party apps from mining `` so much information '' and has started `` limiting the data apps get when [ users ] sign up '' .

Apple CEO Tim Cook is in China for a trade conference and has put forward his thoughts on the recent Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal . As well as calling for tighter regulation on user profiling by apps and services , Cook also took the opportunity to underline Apple 's approach to user privacy . Cook 's comments were reported by Bloomberg and the Apple boss said we 're now at the stage where governments need to step in : `` I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary , '' he said . `` The ability of anyone to know what you 've been browsing about for years , who your contacts are , who their contacts are , things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life – from my own point of view it should n't exist , '' Cook continued . Apple has always made a point of taking a different approach to privacy , by not monetizing user content or collecting more information on people running iOS and macOS than is absolutely necessary ( you can read Apple 's privacy policy in full here ) . According to Cook , that was to avoid incidents like the one current dominating the tech headlines . `` We 've worried for a number of years that people in many countries were giving up data probably without knowing fully what they were doing and that these detailed profiles that were being built of them , '' says Cook . `` That one day something would occur and people would be incredibly offended by what had been done without them being aware of it , '' he added . “ Unfortunately that prediction has come true more than once . '' Facebook continues to scramble to limit the damage caused by scandal , promising that such data misuse will never happen again .

At long last , Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has broken his silence regarding the Cambridge Analytica data abuse scandal that has been active for several days . Almost as if to prove how close he is to the situation , Zuckerberg created a detailed timeline of events . “ We have a responsibility to protect your data , and if we ca n't then we do n't deserve to serve you , ” Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post on his own page . “ I 've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this does n't happen again . ” Zuckerberg then goes on to detail the events leading to this PR and security disaster , starting with how Facebook used to allow users to share their friends ’ profiles and information with third party apps as far back as 2007 , a change that would be all but repealed in 2014 . The Facebook head continues to describe Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan ’ s Facebook personality quiz app released in 2013 . Facebook ’ s chief then admits to having been informed by The Guardian in 2015 that Kogan had shared the data of 50 million Facebook users , which he had obtained through said Facebook quiz , with political strategy firm Cambridge Analytica . Facebook then forced the app to shutdown and for both parties to formally certify that the said data was deleted . Finally , Zuckerberg claims to have just learned last week from several publications that this data was not deleted . In fact , said data was used by Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign as leverage to win the election . Though Zuckerberg makes no mention of the data ’ s aforementioned use , it ’ s widely reported to have been a resource for the Trump campaign . “ This was a breach of trust between Kogan , Cambridge Analytica and Facebook , ” Zuckerberg wrote . “ But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it . We need to fix that . ” The Facebook chief then goes on to promise change to its platform as a result of this breach . First , the company plans to investigate all apps that have or have had access to large amounts of information before Facebook flipped the switch in 2014 . The social network also plans to ban any app maker that does not agree to a full audit and informing its users should a violation be found . Facebook has also promised to limit developers ’ access to user data if said user hasn ’ t used the app within three months , as well as reduce the amount of data given to an app when a user signs up to just name , profile photo and email address . If developers want to get deeper access to information , then a contract with each user will have to be signed to allow them to do so . Finally , within the next month Facebook will feature each users ’ app data permissions prominently above the News Feed . This was already a function of the Settings tools within Facebook , but never have they been placed so blatantly on the app 's front page . These are all welcome changes and refreshing transparency , but the negligence to recognize what this breached data was used for and the implications it may have had on global political discourse isn ’ t lost on us . Facebook promises to have more information on its swathe of privacy-focused changes ‘ in the next few days . ’
WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has joined the campaign urging Facebook users to ditch the social media giant in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal . Supporting a growing anti-Facebook Twitter movement , Acton , who served on Facebook 's board after it bought WhatsApp in 2014 , tweeted `` It is time '' followed by the hashtag # deletefacebook . It is time . # deletefacebookMarch 20 , 2018 The social media giant has come under fire after it was revealed that data analysis company Cambridge Analytica accessed the personal data of over 50 million Facebook users without their permission . Cambridge Analytica is said to have sourced the data from the creator of a personality profiling test which 270,000 Facebook users took . It 's suspected that Facebook has known about the leak since 2015 , but it became public only after media outlets reported on it . Acton has history with Facebook , dating back to 2009 when the company turned him down for a job . At the time he tweeted `` Facebook turned me down . It was a great opportunity to connect with some fantastic people . Looking forward to life 's next adventure . '' Fast-forward to 2014 , when Facebook bought WhatsApp for $ 16 billion and Acton joined Facebook 's board with his WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum . Acton headed up engineering internally for WhatsApp , and played a big role in pushing encryption into the messaging app . In September last year Acton announced his departure from Facebook to focus on his new endeavor , to `` start a nonprofit focused at the intersection of nonprofit , technology and communications '' .

Facebook is already connected to games in a lot of ways , especially on mobile where users can log in using their Facebook accounts . Now , Facebook is looking to get even more mixed in with a new Software Development Kit ( SDK ) that puts a strong emphasis on game streaming , especially on the popular front of PC gaming . And , this is n't Facebook 's first shot at game streaming , either . For developers , the new SDK is positioned as a way to draw in more community engagement and get gamers sharing . It will also offer them analytics on gamer activity . But , livestreaming is clearly positioned front and center . With solo streamers setting records on Twitch , it 's a market plenty want to get a bite of . Twitch , YouTube and Mixer are all competing for the same pie . Now , Facebook is working on getting itself a good slice . Only last January , Facebook landed an exclusive eSports streaming deal with the ESL for Dota 2 and Counter Strike : Global Offensive competitions . The new SDK has the possibility of bringing even more livestreams to Facebook . A particular advantage the SDK has is that it does n't require any extra special software or hardware to handle the streams , lowering the barrier of entry for gamers to put their streams in front of viewers . It will also enable a clipping feature similar to the social sharing seen on Sony and Microsoft consoles . While much hinges on how many developers make use of the new SDK , it 's likely to give Facebook a little more firepower against its stiff competition . The new SDK will be available for developers soon , and applies to mobile , PC and console gaming . We 're on the ground at the Game Developers Conference ( GDC ) in San Francisco this week covering the latest in gaming , from mobile and consoles to VR headsets . Catch up on all the latest from GDC 2018 so far !

There ’ s a brand new firmware update for the Nintendo Switch available now that should make it a whole lot easier to connect with your friends . Released on March 12 , update 5.0 brings a few changes to the system , but the most significant is that you can now add your Facebook and Twitter friends through the console ’ s Friend Suggestions section . You will , of course have to link your social media accounts to your Nintendo Switch accounts and your social media friends will have to have done the same for them to appear as a suggestion . But it 's a far easier way to connect than posting your Friend Code out into the wild on your social media platform of choice in the hopes fellow Switch players will pick it up . Outside of this , there have also been some parental control changes . To make parental control PIN entry less obvious , the default entry method is now to use the control stick and buttons rather than the on-screen touch pad . If this doesn ’ t suit , you can always change back to the traditional method by holding the plus button when the entry prompt appears . Captured videos will also be restricted by Parental Controls in accordance with the software you ’ ve restricted and the rating limits you ’ ve placed . If there 's a game you want to make an exception for , the new parental controls will allow you to white-list specific games that would otherwise be restricted while keeping your play-time limits . Any digital software purchases you make on a PC or smartphone will now start downloading sooner – even if your Switch is in Sleep Mode – and you ’ ll also receive notifications when any games you ’ ve pre-ordered become ready to play ( as if you weren ’ t counting down the days ) . Arms and Kirby fans will be glad to know there are now 24 new user icons for you to choose from . And to top things off , that issue with play times displaying incorrectly has been solved . You can wave your Breath of the Wild and Skyrim commitment in the face of anyone that ever doubted you once more . This is n't perhaps quite as significant an update as we would have expected from 5.0 ( usually these numbers are reserved for big hitters ) . However , it does bring some small welcome changes .

BlackBerry is suing Facebook , Instagram and WhatsApp for violating patents related to its BlackBerry Messenger mobile app . In its complaint , BlackBerry says that it has been an innovator in mobile communications for 30 years and that its BlackBerry Messenger service `` revolutionized instant messaging by providing users with secure , user-friendly , point-to-point instant messaging on their mobile devices '' . Read more : MediaFire BlackBerry goes on to accuse Facebook , as well as WhatsApp and Instagram ( which Facebook owns ) of co-opting its innovations , `` using a number of the innovative security , user interface , and functionality enhancing features that made BlackBerry ’ s products such a critical and commercial success in the first place '' . The complaint specifically mentions tagging people in photos , combining mobile gaming and messaging , use of cryptographic techniques for security , and status updates designed to optimize battery life . In a statement , Blackberry said : `` As a cybersecurity and embedded software leader , BlackBerry 's view is that Facebook , Instagram , and WhatsApp could make great partners in our drive toward a securely connected future , and we continue to hold this door open to them . '' Facebook 's response was less diplomatically phrased . In a tweet to Cheddar , the social network 's vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said : “ Blackberry ’ s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business . Having abandoned its efforts to innovate , Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others . We intend to fight . ” Grewal is no stranger to tech IP battles . A former US magistrate , he joined Facebook 's legal team in 2016 after overseeing cases including the vicious Apple vs Samsung patent fight . With so many interface and security patents involved , and such well-equipped legal teams on both sides , this latest IP dust-up could be just as brutal . Via The Verge

Facebook has ditched a controversial feature that split users ' news feeds in two - one with ads and original posts from friends , and another for content from publishers . Users had to click an 'Explore Feed ' button to access unpromoted posts from publishers . In October , Facebook began testing Explore Feed with users in Sri Lanka , Guatemala , Bolivia , Cambodia , Serbia and Slovakia . It was also available as an option for users in other countries . In a statement to the Guardian , Facebook said : “ People have told us they want an easier way to see posts from friends and family , so we are testing two separate feeds , one as a dedicated space with posts from friends and family and another as a dedicated space for posts from Pages . ” However , the change went down badly ; engagement with Facebook pages tumbled , and its implementation without consultation with stakeholders was described as `` downright Orwellian '' . In a blog post , Adam Mosseri , head of News Feed at Facebook , admitted : `` In surveys , people told us they were less satisfied with the posts they were seeing , and having two separate feeds didn ’ t actually help them connect more with friends and family . '' Facebook is still tinkering with what you see in your News Feed , but its new aim is to combat fake news rather than make you feel closer to your aunts and uncles . In January , CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would soon start showing more news stories from local news publishers and friends in an attempt to drown out public posts engineered to stir up unrest . `` Many people told me they thought that if we could turn down the temperature on the more divisive issues and instead focus on concrete local issues , then we 'd all make more progress together , '' he said . Unfortunately it has n't turned out as smoothly as Facebook might have hoped , and some small publishers claim the algorithm change has decimated their businesses . Lifestyle site Little Things claimed it had to close after losing 75 % of its organic page views – similar to the drop reported by Slovakian journalist Filip Struhárik after Explore Feed was implemented in the country . `` [ The ] 60 biggest Slovak media pages have four times fewer interactions ( likes , comments , shares ) since the test , '' Struhárik observed , analysing reports from CloudTangle ( a social monitoring company owned by Facebook ) . Mark Zuckerberg made it his new year 's resolution to clean up the site after the discovery of 470 fake pages and accounts with connections to Russia that bought ads during the 2016 US elections . Facebook said the ads did n't lean towards either or the two main parties , but instead seemed to be designed to agitate feelings around controversial issues like gun control . The site has been very public about the changes it 's making to turn around its image , and we expect there 'll be more announcements soon . Via the Guardian

In an effort to clean up its act , Facebook took a leaf out of Redditâ€™s book and began testing upvote and downvote buttons for comments.Â While the trial was carried out in the US , Facebook is now rolling out the new tool to more users . Going by tweets posted since the start of its rollout over the weekend , it appears that most of the users are in Australia and New Zealand . Does Facebook now have some kind of upvote/downvote system ? Never seen this before ðŸ¤¨ pic.twitter.com/ysscCMq2MiApril 29 , 2018 The new tool has been employed for comments on public posts and , Facebook insists , isnâ€™t similar to the thumbs-up and thumbs-down options for ‘ likingâ€™ or ‘ dislikingâ€™ posts.Â Hmmmm . Not sure I like the Upvote and Downvote feature of Facebook . Time will tell I guess . pic.twitter.com/hxvjW7HaTXApril 29 , 2018 Facebook wants its users to use the new tool to downvote “ bad comments ” that have “ bad intentions or [ are ] disrespectful ” , but there doesnâ€™t seem to be anything to stop users from employing the downvote button in a similar manner to the dislike option . ok seriously facebook comments having an upvote/downvote system now is hurting my brainApril 29 , 2018 Users , however , canâ€™t seem to make up their minds about the new tool . While Facebook might be doing everything it can to recover its tarnished reputation , it might take time for the new system to work as efficiently as it does on Reddit .

In the wake of the ongoing Cambridge Analytica scandal and questions around its ability to impact elections , Facebook 's been trying to reassure both users and governments that it takes its responsibilities seriously . The latest remedy the company has released to try and deal with its public image problem comes in the form of a new video , which looks fondly back on what made the platform so successful in its earlier days , and self-critically examines what factors have caused its downhill slide since . Aside from some rather vague ‘ we need to do better ’ statements from CEO Mark Zuckerberg , the new advert is the closest the company ’ s come to admitting that it has a serious image issue and that it has substantially strayed from its initial intentions . “ We came here for the friends ” , the video ’ s voiceover begins , before rolling through a string of examples of simpler online interactions that apparently made us feel “ a little less alone ” . “ But then something happened , ” it continues , before explaining that problems started when “ we had to deal with spam , clickbait , fake news , and data misuse . '' However , `` from now on , '' says the video , `` Facebook will do more to keep you safe and protect your privacy . ” The crux of the ad is that the company will at least try to return its focus to the ‘ friends and family ’ aspects of the service , and in doing so , steer away from the current affairs and political news content maelstrom that it has become . The video will apparently run on TV , online and in cinemas through till July , and forms part of a massive campaign that the company is undertaking to restore its image in the wake of the recent scandals . Physical adverts railing against fake news , spam and clickbait have also been seen around various major US cities over the last month and are expected to start hitting more locations as the campaign continues . Despite the ongoing crisis that the company faces , Facebook ’ s reported earnings for the first quarter of 2018 have beaten Wall Street ’ s estimates , although they are still down since the previous quarter . After having consistently risen by between $ 1-2 billion each quarter throughout 2017 , the first three months of 2018 saw earnings fall from $ 12.97 to $ 11.97 billion . The company 's quarterly report reveals that 98.5 percent of that came from advertising revenue . Despite the drop in earnings , the number of daily and monthly active users also continues to climb , with a jump of 50 and 70 million users respectively , quarter-on-quarter . This brings the numbers up to 1.45 billion daily and 2.2 billion monthly active users .

If you thought using Facebook was free , think again . The old adage “ there ’ s no such thing as a free lunch ” holds true for Facebook ’ s business model , which many pundits have argued it build on trading users ’ personal data as currency . And what the social media platform does – or allows others to do – with that data has recently copped a lot of criticism in the wake of the ongoing Cambridge Analytica Scandal . Facebook has a tough fight ahead of it as it tries to restore its name and win back public trust , and the latest shot in that war is an official blog post titled Hard Questions , which seeks to reassure Facebook users that they “ are not the product ” . In the post , Facebook ’ s vice president of advertising , Rob Goldman , addresses the question , “ If I 'm not paying for Facebook , am I the product ? ” “ No , ” is Goldman 's answer . “ Our product is social media – the ability to connect with the people that matter to you , wherever they are in the world . It ’ s the same with a free search engine , website or newspaper . The core product is reading the news or finding information – and the ads exist to fund that experience . ” While Goldman is quick to compare Facebook to a “ website or newspaper ” , the social media platform has historically fought against any suggestion that it ’ s a media company . In fact , when questioned by the US Senate as to which companies are Facebook ’ s direct competitors , CEO Mark Zuckerberg struggled to come up with an answer . It 's hard to define what service Facebook truly offers , even for its CEO . It not only owns the world 's largest social media network , but sells advertising space and , now , hardware such as the Oculus Rift VR headset and it 's seemingly delayed smart speakers . While the company may claim its main product is the social media site itself , it 's not hard to understand why Goldman 's statement rings hollow . Strictly following the flow of money , Facebook 's free social networking site is largely able to make a profit through the collation and collection of user data , which is then supplied ( usually indirectly ) to advertisers in order to target ads . Most would argue that this structure makes the advertisers the clients – no matter how Facebook wants to spin it – and this blog post likely wo n't do much to change that perception .

A new report claims that Facebook user data can be siphoned off via third-party JavaScript libraries ( from the likes of advertisers ) embedded on sites using the ‘ Login with Facebook ’ ability . Facebook has confirmed to TechCrunch that it ’ s investigating the report , with the serious sounding exploit allegedly capable of hoovering up user data that includes name , gender , age , email address , location and potentially your profile photo . How many websites might be affected by this problem ? According to researchers at Princeton University , some 434 of the top million websites have the dodgy script which is pilfering Facebook user data . The websites in question include MongoDB , and the vast majority of these sites probably aren ’ t aware of the issue with the ‘ Login with Facebook ’ feature . MongoDB certainly wasn ’ t aware , and after being informed by TechCrunch , it took action and shut the script down . Facebook has issued a statement to say : “ Scraping Facebook user data is in direct violation of our policies . While we are investigating this issue , we have taken immediate action by suspending the ability to link unique user IDs for specific applications to individual Facebook profile pages , and are working to institute additional authentication and rate limiting for Facebook Login profile picture requests . ” Of course , this comes at a bad time for Facebook , with its CEO Mark Zuckerberg being questioned by US Senators last week regarding allegations over the misuse of personal data by Cambridge Analytica – and wider concerns which have been raised about Facebook ’ s data collection policies in general . Rusty Carter , VP of Product Management at Arxan Technologies , commented on the JavaScript affair : “ The issue here is not when you go to facebook.com , it 's every other website that uses Facebook as a way to login . This confirms what privacy experts have been saying – social login ( for example , 'sign in with your Facebook account ' ) is not safe . The convenience for the company and website developer has trumped privacy to date . This has to change . ” He added : “ By Facebook allowing unencrypted information into the browser , private information is now available to anything running in that browser , whether that be other trackers , or malicious software ( like malware that can conduct man-in-the-middle attacks ) . “ While open APIs create convenience , applications expected to interact with one another should be secured together . This can be accomplished first by securing the code ( obfuscation and runtime protection against tampering ) while adding mutual authentication of the applications themselves . ”
As Mark Zuckerberg faced questions from US Senators last week about the alleged misuse of personal data by Cambridge Analytica , the issues of potential subversion of democracy , privacy , and data protection are more likely to be at the forefront of the general public ’ s thoughts rather than the mobile industry . But among the many revelations that resulted from the scandal was that Facebook had been collecting call records and SMS data from Android devices for some time . Although never a secret practice , many users were unaware of this and only discovered the collection when they decided to take Facebook up on its offer to download all the data that the social network held on them . For most people , this was images , likes and posts , but others noticed that years ’ worth of phone call data , along with names , numbers and duration . Now it ’ s important to stress that this was an opt-in feature as Facebook uses phone book data for its friend recommendations . However ArsTechnica notes that if this permission was granted before Android 4.1 Jelly Bean , then giving Facebook access to read contacts also gave them access to call and message logs . This permission structure was changed in Android 4.1 which means two separate permissions had to be granted – one for contacts and one for contact logs . But it is also noted that a more explicit request for this data is made by the Facebook Messenger application for Android . In contrast , iOS does not allow this data to be shared . Facebook responded with a blog post that said users had to consciously give their permission for such data to be collected and that this can be switched off at any time , with all previous data deleted . “ When this feature is enabled , uploading your contacts also allows us to use information like when a call or text was made or received , ” said Facebook . “ This feature does not collect the content of your calls or text messages . Your information is securely stored and we do not sell this information to third parties . You are always in control of the information you share with Facebook . ” Regardless of whether you think this is an intrusion of privacy or just a handy way to find more people that you know online , the practice is one that will attract interest from mobile operators . Over the past few years , mobile operators have had to compete with over-the-top ( OTT ) applications that use their data networks , but from which they don ’ t receive any direct financial benefit from and in some cases actually bypass their own services . A good example is chat applications like WhatsApp , which allow users to circumvent SMS , MMS and international call charges . A recent report from ReportLinker claimed that in 2016 , 89 billion SMS messages were sent but this is set to fall to 64 billion in 2018 . In 2020 , the figure is expected to be 40 billion . The issue of Facebook ’ s data collection impacts two major industry issues . The first is regulation . Telecoms companies , especially in Europe love to complain that they are subject to strict rules whereas OTT player are not . This , they argue , means there isn ’ t a level playing field . Zuckerberg has suggested that the social media industry may have to accept greater regulation going forward and the operators will be keeping a key eye on proceedings . But the revelation that Facebook has large amounts of user call and message data will be more worrying . Being an OTT application might mean you benefit from networks built by others , but not being integrated means you can only see what users are doing on your application . Telcos on the other hand have access to integrated billing and the ability to see everything that takes place on their network . Call and message data is a treasure trove of information that was seemingly supposed to be for the network providers ’ eyes only . If an OTT competitor also has this data , then that advantage has been eroded . “ The Facebook infringement on mobile operator data is not something new that happened overnight , ” argues Indranil Chatterjee from Openwave Mobility , a firm which helps mobile operators manage their traffic . “ OTTs such as Google and Facebook launched the land grab a few years ago . In 3 years they wiped out operators ’ voice revenues and in 2 years they mopped up messaging . “ Operators are still holding on to PII ( Personally Identifiable Information ) data regarding subscriber billing information etc . but the operators are not allowed to use that data . Contrast that with the carte blanche approach OTTs take . They play by different rules . And those rules could be about to get a lot tougher as EU and US regulators adopt stricter regulation . “ There ’ s no such thing as a free lunch and OTT have certainly feasted on other people ’ s lunches . OTTs are so large and powerful that regulation might not impact them too much – it might be the businesses such as mobile operators who rely on user data that suffer the consequences of tighter regulation – while the OTTs continue to grow stronger . ” The end result of this is likely to be greater regulation of social media platforms , but what this means is still up for debate . It ’ s possible that the imminent arrival of the EU ’ s General Data Protection Regulation could be a basis for other regulators . “ In the hearings , Zuckerberg repeated a concept he has been voicing for the last few weeks , and admitted regulation is now ‘ inevitable ’ for online platforms , ” says Luca Schiavoni , an analyst with Assembly Research . “ He also added , though , that regulation could be easy to comply with for a large company like Facebook , whereas this could be more difficult for a smaller start-up . “ Size of businesses aside , regulation will have to be designed with two objectives in mind : the improvement of transparency and user awareness ; and the flexibility needed to make sure rules do not become outdated too quickly . To this end , well-monitored guidelines could go a long way , so long as there are sufficient incentives for companies to keep a trustworthy behaviour . ” Facebook ’ s use of phone data might be nothing new , and regulation might not change anything , but the saga serves as a reminder of the difficulties that many operators have when competing with the platforms . And they may increase calls for OTT regulation in the future .
By making a minor change in its terms and conditions of use , Facebook is moving the data of all users outside of the US , Canada and the European Union from its Ireland headquarters to its offices in California , effectively escaping the EU ’ s new privacy protection law . This shift in responsibility comes despite Facebook ’ s promise to protect user data in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal . The move will be completed before the EU ’ s General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) law goes into effect on May 25 , and will affect users from Africa , Asia , Australia and Latin America . That ’ s about 70 % of all Facebook users . Under the EU ’ s new law , Facebook , or any company , becomes liable to fines of up to 4 % of their global turnover in case of a data breach . For Facebook , that could amount to around US $ 1.6 billion . In a statement to Reuters , Facebook downplayed the significance of the changes made to the terms and conditions , saying , “ We apply the same privacy protections everywhere , regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland . ” Yet , when questioned by the US Senate whether the social media giant would adhere to the GDPR , Mark Zuckerberg said yes but noncommittally referred to the GDPR “ controls ” as opposed to its “ protections ” . Once the jurisdiction moves away from Ireland , Facebook will be governed by the more lenient laws of the US , giving the company some freedom on how it handles user data . [ Via Reuters ]

Facebook is reportedly designing its very own processor hardware so as to reduce reliance on partners like Intel and Qualcomm in its device efforts . The news comes via anonymous sources speaking to Bloomberg and apparent job listings . The outlet reports that Facebook is currently in the early stages of building a team to design silicon semiconductors , an “ end-to-end SoC/ASIC , firmware and driver development organization. ” Indeed that very job posting is still live on Facebook 's online job board at the time of writing . Bloomberg suspects that Facebook could use these chips in future device endeavors , artificial intelligence software and server hardware . Perhaps the delayed Facebook speaker will use one of Facebook ’ s own chips . It ’ s interesting to see that Facebook is still openly hiring for this position with the news out from an awfully accurate team of leak reporters . The job seems to call for someone skilled in processor technology in lots of applications , but particularly AI and machine learning on or via mobile systems on chip ( SoC ) . Those types of technologies are popularly behind smart speakers . Perhaps Facebook wants to control where the data lives on these devices even more directly with its own silicon versus a third party ’ s . After all , what Facebook does with said data is under more scrutiny than it ’ s ever been . Facebook declined to comment on Bloomberg ’ s report . At any rate , it ’ s now in the open that Facebook is working toward developing its own processors for the purpose of AI and machine learning through SoCs . What that means for the future of Facebook products is unknown – perhaps this has something to do with future versions of the Oculus Go VR headset . One running with Facebook-developed silicon could possibly gain a Nintendo-like inherent advantage in performance , with hardware and software in harmony . Via 9to5Mac
A large number of tech firms – 34 companies in total – have signed a new collaborative agreement to help fight cyber-attacks . The companies in question include the likes of ARM , Facebook , HP , Microsoft , Nokia , Oracle , and Symantec , and the Cybersecurity Tech Accord pledges to help defend customers worldwide against cybercriminals who engage in hacking and spreading malware . This comes after Juniper Research predicted last year that cyber-attacks on businesses and organizations across the globe would cause total economic losses of around $ 8 trillion ( around £5.5 trillion ) through to 2022 . Microsoft President Brad Smith commented : “ The devastating attacks from the past year demonstrate that cybersecurity is not just about what any single company can do but also about what we can all do together . This tech sector accord will help us take a principled path towards more effective steps to work together and defend customers around the world . ” So what exactly does the agreement specify that the companies in question will do ? The first point is to mount stronger defenses against cyber-attacks globally , along with opposing any efforts to tamper with or exploit these firms ’ products and services . Those are fairly obvious starting points , but the agreement also says that the companies will move to “ increase cybersecurity capacity in every sector and region ” , empowering developers and businesses to better protect themselves . And finally , collective action is promised , with various partnerships planned with the likes of security researchers and industry experts to help better deal with vulnerability disclosures , to share threat intelligence and generally work against the spread of malware . The first meeting of the companies will happen at the RSA Conference in San Francisco , and future actions will include collaboration over security guidelines and broadly developed features to combat cybercriminals .

Have you deleted your Facebook account in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal ? Tech.pinions , a technology and media research firm , claims that almost 10 % of people in the US have done just that . The firm surveyed 1,000 Americans across age and gender demographics . While not all respondents were Facebook users , a whopping 17 % of respondents reported having removed the Facebook app from their smartphones , and 9 % had deleted their accounts altogether . As of January 2018 , statistics aggregator Statista reports that Facebook serves roughly 214 million users in the US . So , to put those numbers into better perspective , that means around 36.38 million people in the US have deleted the Facebook phone app , while 19.26 million have deleted their accounts altogether . We 'd be pretty concerned about losing nearly 20 million sets of eyeballs on ads , but according to Tech.pinions , those numbers might not even have Facebook worried . In its survey , 39 % of respondents said they ’ re now more careful about not only what they post , but what they ‘ Like ’ and react to on brand pages and within friends ’ posts . Meanwhile , 35 % claim to be using the social network less than they used to following the data breach . These numbers should be of real concern to Facebook ’ s bottom line . As Tech.pinions says , the fact that users that are engaging less with content and brands means they simply aren ’ t as valuable to companies paying for traffic or buying ads . Perhaps to stem this supposed tide , Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly floated the idea of introducing a paid version of Facebook with zero ads and stronger privacy protections . However , he may want to reconsider , as a massive 59 % of survey respondents said that they would n't be interested . The problem with all of this is that , whether you like it or not , it ’ s growing more and more clear across the internet landscape that , if you ’ re not paying for the product , then at some level you yourself are the product . So , unless attitudes change toward paying directly for social media and other connected services , there will always be a third party for those services to please ( ie advertisers ) . Via BGR
While Mark Zuckerberg faced a grilling from Congress about the use of millions of users ' private information without consent , Facebook 's developers were working on something rather more fun : augmented reality doodles . The feature , which is rolling out over the coming days to those who have n't opted to delete their accounts , is integrated into the camera tool in Facebook stories . While pointing your camera at an object , you can use your finger to draw color-shifting shapes on the screen with a 3D brush . You can then see them from different angles as you move your phone around and , with some careful manoeuvring , draw full 3D objects . “ We wanted to give people an easy way to create with augmented reality and draw in the world around them , ” John Barnet , Facebook camera product manager , told TechCrunch . It 's a fun idea , though it works best if your phone has a stylus ; drawing 3D objects that interact with the environment using your fingertip is awkward and the tool tends to lag ever so slightly , resulting in jagged lines . It 's also worth noting that you ca n't use your camera 's flash while sketching in 3D ( which is understandable , because it would interfere with the lighting on your creations ) . Facebook Stories has also borrowed Instagram 's Boomerang feature , enabling you to create endlessly looping animations from snippets of video . Facebook 's Camera tool already had something similar but Boomerang is more refined and gives better results . Look out for this appearing at the same time as the doodles ( and possibly more apologies from Zuckerberg ) .

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has testified to the US Congress in response to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal , and although the bulk of his speech was published well in advance , the following Q & A session with senators threw up some interesting ideas . Each senator was given just five minutes , but used that time to give Zuckerberg a thorough grilling . Senator Orrin Hatch met Zuckerberg in 2010 as part of the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force – a committee that aims to maintain the position of the US as a leader in the global tech industry . “ You said back then that Facebook would always be free , ” Hatch said during his five minutes . “ Is that still your objective ? ” “ Senator , yes , ” Zuckerberg said . “ There will always be a version of Facebook that is free . It is our mission to try to help connect everyone around the world and bring the world closer together . In order to do that , we believe we need to deliver a service that everyone can afford . ” It 's an interesting statement . Zuckerberg took several days to respond directly after the data scandal broke , and since then he has stuck firmly to the same message : Facebook is going to identify any other app developers that have dabbled in the same waters as Cambridge Analytica , and it 's taking steps to better protect its users ' data , and it 's very sorry . This is the first time he 's implied that different tiers of membership might be the way forward . This mention of affordability could suggest a move towards a YouTube-style system , with an ad-driven version available for free , and an ad-free subscription service for users who are willing to pay . The possibility of a premium version of Facebook also arose in an interview with COO Sheryl Sandberg earlier this week . NBC asked Sandberg if it would one day be possible for users to opt out of having their data shared with advertisers . “ We have different forms of opt-out , ” Sandberg said . “ We don ’ t have an opt-out at the highest level . That would be a paid product . ” Like Zuckerberg , Sandberg neither denied nor confirmed that such a product might be in the pipeline . So far Facebook has been extremely careful about its messaging , so we 'll be keeping an eye out for any further news .

Between data scandals , apologies , updates , and congressional hearings , Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have been juggling quite a lot recently . It ’ s unsurprising , therefore , that reports have recently emerged that the social media Goliath is delaying the reveal of its home smart speaker . However , in a somewhat poetic instance of information being released before it ’ s wanted , a recent patent application has revealed what Facebook ’ s smart speaker may look like . Titled ‘ Electronic Device ’ and filed in December 2016 , the patent reveals more about what the speaker looks like rather than any information on its internals or features . Shown from all angles , the device ’ s top appears to have the main speaker with nothing else of interest . It ’ s been rumored that Facebook ’ s smart speaker will be jumping into the home assistant game already equipped with a screen but there isn ’ t any obvious sign of one here . Some have wondered if figure seven on the patent depicts a screen with buttons underneath but the fact that this part of the patent is labelled as the bottom side makes this seem somewhat unlikely . Unless the speaker is intended to be positioned vertically rather than horizontally , in which case a screen here could be possible where it would sit like the Amazon Echo Show with its speaker on the back rather than beneath the screen . Regardless , given this is a patent filed in 2016 , there ’ s no guarantee that this is what the finished product will actually look like and Facebook could have made many changes to its design in the meantime . It ’ s not entirely clear when Facebook will unveil its smart speaker at the moment but any time in the immediate future doesn ’ t seem likely .
As part of its effort to prove that it 's changed its ways following the Cambridge Analytica scandal , Facebook has announced a Data Abuse Bounty – a cash fee for anyone who can point the finger of blame at other apps developer misusing personal information . The new reward is much like Facebook 's existing Bug Bounty Program , which provides cash and kudos to experts who report potential security vulnerabilities and give the company time to fix them before telling anyone else . To report data abuse , you 'll need first-hand knowledge and proof of the developer 's wrongdoing . This could involve sending data to other companies that intend to sell it ( we 're looking at you , CA ) , using it for political influence , or plain old scamming . There 's no set limit on the amount of cash available , but the bounty will depend on the potential impact of the abuse . Considering the Cambridge Analytica scandal affected as many as 87 million users and Facebook is now facing a class action lawsuit , that could be a hefty sum . For reference , vulnerabilities reported through the Bug Bounty Program have earned their finders up to US $ 40,000 ( about £30,000 , AU $ 50,000 ) . In his first statement since the CA scandal broke , Facebook 's CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would be focusing on identifying any other companies that have been doing the same thing . `` We are doing a set of things to restrict the amount of access that developers can get going forward , '' he said , `` but the other [ thing ] is that we need to make sure that there are n't any other Cambridge Analyticas out there , or folks who have improperly accessed data . '' Facebook itself has tightened approval for third-party apps and limited the amount of data they can access , but this is the first time it 's reached out to users directly to help shore up its efforts .
Facebook is facing international investigations into the illicit harvesting of users ' personal data . The information was collected by Cambridge Analytica , a political consulting firm that backed President Trump ’ s 2016 election campaign . According to a whistleblower , Cambridge Analytica gathered data from 50 million users ( a figure that Facebook has now admitted could be as high as 87 million ) , then developed a software program that profiled these citizens to predict voting patterns – and , through micro-targeted ads , influence US citizens ’ voting decisions . We ’ re laying out everything we know and don ’ t know about how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook to influence elections in the US and around the world , and what this means for the tech giant ’ s future . Update : Facebook has published a tool that will tell you whether you were one of the 87 million users affected by the breach . Log into your Facebook account , then visit the page to see if your data was shared with Cambridge Analytica via the app thisisyourdigitallife . Cambridge Analytica ( CA ) obtained voter data through a Facebook-linked app named 'thisisyourdigitallife ' . Through the app , CA member Aleksandr Kogan paid Facebook users in exchange for a detailed personality test , supposedly for academic research purposes . These users volunteered to provide this information – something Facebook Deputy General Counsel was quick to emphasize in a statement : “ The claim that this is a data breach is completely false . Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app , and everyone involved gave their consent . People knowingly provided their information , no systems were infiltrated , and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked . ” But the app also pulled personal data from all of the test-taker ’ s linked Facebook friends without their consent—data that , per Facebook ’ s Platform Policy , can only be used to enhance the in-app experience , and should not be given out to anyone . Instead , Kogan and his associates allegedly built a software platform for influencing US elections , and sold it to Donald Trump . In 2014 , former Trump advisor Steve Bannon ran Cambridge Analytica . Around a quarter of a million people took the test willingly , but millions of people reportedly had their private data used for political and financial gain without their knowledge or consent . The number of people affected was originally believed to be 50 million , but in a blog post on April 4 , Facebook revised the figure to 87 million . Facebook only became aware of CA ’ s breach of contract in 2016 , but reportedly waited months to order CA to delete the data . The consulting firm subsequently ignored this order , and Facebook allegedly never followed up to check . Only after the media asked for comment did Facebook apparently realize it had been duped for four years . Facebook responded by threatening to sue outlets reporting on the issue . Yesterday @ facebook threatened to sue us . Today we publish this . Meet the whistleblower blowing the lid off Facebook & Cambridge Analytica . https : //t.co/QcuBJfBU5TMarch 17 , 2018 On April 4 , Facebook admitted that up to 87 million users could have been affected . The majority ( about 70.5 million ) are in the US , but the remaining 19 % are in several other countries , including the UK , Canada , Australia and India . “ We do not know precisely what data the app shared with Cambridge Analytica or exactly how many people were impacted , ” it said . “ Using as expansive a methodology as possible , this is our best estimate of the maximum number of unique accounts that directly installed the thisisyourdigitallife app as well as those whose data may have been shared with the app by their friends . ” On March 21 , five days after the story broke , CEO Mark Zuckerberg used a post on his Facebook page to issue his first comment on the situration . `` We have a responsibility to protect your data , and if we ca n't then we do n't deserve to serve you , ” Zuckerberg wrote . “ I 've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this does n't happen again . ” He promised that the company will investigate all third-party apps that had access to large amounts of data before 2014 ( when Facebook prevented app developers accessing data from users ' friends ) . He added that the site will ban any app developers that do n't comply with a full audit and inform their users if a violation is found . Zuckerberg proposed limiting access to data if a user has n't used an app for three months , and to reduce the amount of information given when a user signs up for an app to just their name , email address and profile photo . If app developers want more information , the user will need to sign a contract to grant permission . Finally , within the next month , app users ' permissions will appear above their news feeds rather than hidden away on a settings page . Zuckerberg repeated his pledge to take action in an interview with CNN the same day – his first public appearance since the scandal broke . On March 25 , Facebook took out full-page ads in several major US and UK newspapers , with the headline `` We have a responsibility to protect your information . If we ca n't , we do n't deserve it . '' The ads quoted Zuckerberg , again promising that the company is `` taking steps to make sure this does n't happen again . '' On April 10 , Zuckerberg testified to the US Congress . His speech began with praise for Facebook 's role as a platform for social change , before moving on to the illicit sharing of user data and taking personal responsibility . `` It was my mistake , and I ’ m sorry , '' he told senators . `` I started Facebook , I run it , and I ’ m responsible for what happens here . '' He gave a brief summary of what happened with Cambridge Analytica and repeated the same pledge he made on March 21 before moving on to the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections . He reiterated the pledge he made in his new year 's resolution , to fix Facebook by weeding out fake accounts and divisive ads Although it operates in the US , Cambridge Analytica is a UK company , meaning the data scandal could have global repercussions . It worked on the Brexit referendum , and has catered to politicians worldwide . An undercover sting video from Britain ’ s Channel 4 News revealed CA executives offering to 'fix ' Sri Lankan elections for an undercover reporter . Its 'services ' included blackmailing , entrapping or extorting rival politicians , and releasing propaganda to the public . One offer was to send 'Ukranian girls ' to a man ’ s house , then release the footage publicly to shame him . These offers to spread targeted disinformation are what most concern government agencies like the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and British Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) . If CA was able to obtain information on voters through Facebook , they would know where to specifically target propaganda to influence elections—just as Russia ’ s Internet Research Agency did in 2016 . CA may not be the only company that has obtained or purchased information that has been obtained through third-party apps . Considering Facebook ’ s inability to check if CA stole private user information , we have no way of knowing how many other companies could be hoarding and selling data to influence democratic elections . The US , UK and EU investigations have only just begun , but they could have major repercussions on how Facebook and other social media companies are required to protect user data in future . Facebook itself is investigating app developers who had access to the same kind of data as Cambridge Analytica . It has also launched a Data Abuse Bounty , offering cash to users who can point the finger at developers misusing personal information . Facebook has typically tried to self-regulate in the face of criticism . Earlier this year , after revealing that advertisers linked to Russia had spent thousands of dollars on ads influence public opinion in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election , the company insisted it would prevent democratic meddling in the future itself . This time , however , that approach might not be enough . The FTC is now officially investigating Facebook , the agency announced on March 26 . This follows an earlier report by Bloomberg that the FTC is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 settlement , which required it to improve its privacy settings so that third parties could not acquire users ’ data without their express knowledge or consent . In its statement announcing the investigation , the FTC said it `` takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook . '' As such , the agency has opened a `` non-public investigation into these practices . '' The FTC could fine Facebook $ 40,000 for each violation of the 2011 settlement ; multiply that by 50 million , and Facebook could be looking at catastrophic financial damages . Along with the FTC , the British ICO is investigating whether Cambridge Analytica could have used similar voter data to influence UK citizens during the Brexit referendum . On March 27 , Zuckerberg refused an invitation to speak to the UK parliament about Facebook 's use of data , instead offering to send one of his senior deputies . The EU ’ s Electoral Commission and Australia 's Privacy Commissioner have also piped up , with both officially investigating Facebook ’ s actions to determine if the data of their voters were used without authorization . In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal , many people have chosen to download their Facebook data and delete their accounts – and some were surprised by what they found . According to a report by Ars Technica published on March 24 , New Zealand man Dylan McKay discovered that the Facebook Lite app had gathered all the contacts from his phone , and logged two years ' worth of calls . McKay claimed it had done so without his permission . Facebook reacted immediately with a post on its Newsroom blog , denying the accusations . `` You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people ’ s call and SMS ( text ) history without their permission , '' it said . `` This is not the case . '' Facebook says that , although its Lite and Messenger apps can log users ' call and text histories , they wo n't do so without explicit consent . Facebook also clarified that it does n't sell any of this data , and it does n't record the content of your messages and calls . It repeated this statement in another blog post on April 4 , but also admitted it had collected more information than was strictly necessary to improve the quality of its service . `` This [ call logging ] means we can surface the people you most frequently connect with at the top of your contact list . '' it explained . `` In the future , the client will only upload to our servers the information needed to offer this feature – not broader data such as the time of calls . ''

Facebook users may about to see the first informative post in a long time at the top of their News Feeds today as Facebook has announced that it will be sending alerts to those affected by the Cambridge Analytica data scandal . Facebook has estimated that around 87 million users had their personal information harvested and used by Cambridge Analytica . The majority of the users affected are believed to be based in the US ( around 70 million ) with another million users in the UK , Indonesia and the Philippines . All 2.2 billion Facebook users will see one of two notices at the the top of their News Feed – one for those affected directly by the data leak and a more general one . Both are titled ‘ Protecting your Information ’ and will provide advice on monitoring data sharing on Facebook , but the message for those already affected will alert them to this . Though Facebook is estimating around 87 million users have been affected , this number isn ’ t actually concrete . Cambridge Analytica has said that it had data on around 30 million users , while Facebook said it settled on the figure of 87 million by calculating the maximum number of friends that users could have had while Cambridge Analytica was actively using its personality quiz to harvest data . Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie , on the other hand , said the number could be even higher than this . As it is , no one is entirely sure just how many people have been affected . This news comes not long after Mark Zuckerberg accepted blame for the scandal and agreed to testify before the US Congress , while Facebook itself made it easier for users to understand and change the data they ’ re sharing . However , Facebook is far from out of the woods after it 's emerged that the social media company was asking hospitals for the medical data of patients . As a result of this continually evolving data scandal , Facebook 's value has plummeted and at this point in time it 's hard to tell when , or if , the company will recover .

With the wounds from the Cambridge Analytica data scandal still raw , Facebook has banned another third-party company from its platform over the improper use of data – this time it 's Canadian political consulting firm AggregateIQ . As with Cambridge Analytica , the charge is that AggregateIQ used data scraped from Facebook in ways that violated the social network 's terms and conditions . In fact , leaked documents had already linked AggregateIQ with Cambridge Analytica , and it seems that association was too strong for Facebook 's liking . `` In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may ... have improperly received [ Facebook ] user data , we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate , '' a Facebook spokesperson told the National Observer in Canada . Some digging by the Guardian has already suggested that AggregateIQ may have mined data from Facebook in relation to the Brexit vote , but all of these investigations are still ongoing . As a result it 's likely to take some time for the full facts to come out . For its part , AggregateIQ says it `` has never managed , nor did we ever have access to , any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica ... AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates . '' It 's been a rough few weeks for Facebook , with data scandals and fresh questions over how it treats user data , but the problems are far from over . Within the next week , Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has to give some answers to US lawmakers .

Last night news broke that Facebook retracted messages sent by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives from recipients ' inboxes , something the average person does n't have the power to do . Facebook told TechCrunch , which has email evidence showing messages that were deleted , that it retracted the messages `` to protect our executives ' communications '' following the Sony Pictures email hack of 2014 . However , because normal users ca n't unsend messages and Facebook did n't disclose to recipients that it was deleting messages from their inboxes , many view the whole thing as a breach of user trust . Now , in the wake of the backlash , Facebook says it will release `` a broader delete message feature '' to users in the coming months . `` This may take some time , '' Facebook said in a statement to TechCrunch on Friday about the unsend feature . `` And until this feature is ready , we will no longer be deleting any executives ' messages . We should have done this sooner – and we 're sorry that we did not . '' Facebook says it 's still working out the particulars of the unsend feature , though one option is to have an expiration timer on messages , causing them to disappear once the timer set by the sender runs out . Facebook currently offers such a timer in Secret Conversations , a feature within Messenger that encrypts messages and lets users determine how long the messages are visible before they disappear . But in order to have these disappearing conversations , users must select the Secret option inside Messenger . The conversations in which Facebook deleted messages sent by Zuckerberg and other executives ' took place in regular Messenger mode . It remains to be seen how the new unsend feature will work , but the timing of the retracted messages revelation could n't be worse for Facebook . The company is already under fire for the Cambridge Analytica data scandal , and it disclosed this week that information from 87 million users may have been obtained improperly by the firm . Zuckerberg is due to testify before US lawmakers next week about how Facebook protects user privacy . Unlike its executives ' messages , the scrutiny Facebook is under wo n't be disappearing any time soon .
Movie posters in the future are going to be awesome if Facebook ’ s new augmented reality ( AR ) technology takes off . Currently in closed beta , Facebook has developed a way to make these advertisements interactive by using your smartphone ’ s camera . It ’ s called AR target tracking , and it ’ s a feature that ’ s exclusive to Facebook ’ s in-app camera tech . Boot it up and your camera will scan what ’ s in front of you , and is able to identify images , logos , signs and more in the real world . Once it detects a match , you ’ ll be treated to unique AR presentation that better bridges the gap between a poster and a fully-fledged teaser trailer . Facebook could eventually tie-in AR content to any and all posters that get pinned around the globe . But for now , it ’ s trialing the tech on two recent films , A Wrinkle in Time and Ready Player One . Augmented reality , as well as virtual reality , are always best viewed through the latest smartphones . However , Facebook is making a point to include as many devices in its AR endeavors as possible by optimizing its algorithm for low-end devices as well . As such , AR target tracking will work on Apple phones going back to the iPhone 5S , and Android phones from no earlier than 2012 . The developer tools for creating AR target tracking assets will be released in the coming months . We ’ ll likely hear much more about it at F8 2018 , Facebook ’ s annual developer conference .

Update : Tinder has confirmed that the service is now back up and running - so you can get back to swiping frivolously and happily . Thousands of people 's futures have just been diverted onto a different course as their prospective spouses , lovers and hookups were ripped from their grasp by a change to Facebook 's permissions . First raised by Select All , the issue has come as Facebook has beefed up its security in the turbulent wake of Cambridge Analytica scandal , which is now reported to have affected 87 million users . The problem comes when Tinder users who logged in with Facebook try to open the app , and are presented with a login screen telling them they need to update their permissions with Facebook . Tapping the 'Ask me ' option below leads them back to the start again , a login loop that can not be defeated no matter how many tears are shed . Tinder confirmed the issue via Twitter , which is where most people have headed to unload their ire at the change . A technical issue is preventing users from logging into Tinder . We apologize for the inconvenience and are working to have everyone swiping again soon.April 4 , 2018 ( The statement has garnered 174 likes at the time of writing , although it 's unclear whether that 's users happy that there 's some sort of update or people in relationships gleefully liking the fact the service is down ) . However , this looks like it 's all sorted , but it has fewer likes than the missive informing the world it 's down . And we 're back ! Apologies for the inconvenience . We missed you too . 💚 pic.twitter.com/796L1gLsCvApril 4 , 2018 A Facebook update to Select All confirmed it was sorting the issue , which it now seems to have done : “ This was part of the changes that we announced today , and we are working with Tinder to address this issue . ” It seems other services , like Bumble ( the only one anyone in the office is actually using at the moment , the loved-up psychopaths ) is still functioning fine through the Facebook login . This story was updated to reflect the service is now back up and running .
As part of its overhaul of user privacy , Facebook has announced a raft of changes to how it handles user data , including removing the ability to find other Facebook users by searching for their phone number . This function made it easier for people to find one another in countries where many people share the same name ( it makes up 7 % of all searches in Bangladesh , for example ) , but in a blog post , Facebook explained that criminals have `` abused these features to scrape public profile information by submitting phone numbers or email addresses they already have through search and account recovery '' . Facebook has also taken steps to limit the data available to third-party apps . It 's tightening the review process for apps that request your photos and posts , and apps are no longer allowed to request sensitive data including marital status , religious views , education and work history – the type of data that enabled organizations like Cambridge Analytica to deliver precisely targeted ads to voters in the 2016 US presidential election . In the same blog post , Facebook admitted that its Messenger and Facebook Lite Android apps gather users ' call and text history on an opt-in basis . The site reiterated its earlier claim that it does n't access the content of any messages , but said it was necessary to review the feature to make sure that was the case , and has cut down the amount of information it records . `` This [ call logging ] means we can surface the people you most frequently connect with at the top of your contact list . '' it explained . `` In the future , the client will only upload to our servers the information needed to offer this feature – not broader data such as the time of calls . '' These are all positive steps , but are small comfort following the revelation that Cambridge Analytica might have in fact harvested data from 87 million Facebook users , rather than the 50 million originally reported .
Thanks to a combination of self-owns as well as a management structure focused around the decisions of a single man , Facebook has not had a good few years . Faced with a whirlwind of issues – from the propagation of fake news , suicides and murders on Facebook Live , abuse of its advertising system to data leaks and reports of social media use affecting mental health – each response has been deficient , tone deaf and weak . It took a very long time for Facebook to even admit that its actions “ as a platform ” were part of the problem , and Zuckerberg ’ s grossly naïve , plainly faux puppy face that he just “ wants to connect the world ” doesn ’ t really solve any of the large and growing issues that Facebook is experiencing . The fact of the matter is , when your social network is used by a third of the entire world , several things are going to happen . People will take advantage of the severe lack of knowledge most users will have around privacy and access to their data , others will treat the user base as the most accessible targets of scamming in history , and what used to be small insular pockets of the world with contained regional conflicts will now be much more easily exploited . Humans have carefully attempted to craft a world order after centuries of enormous death and suffering on a global scale , and while not perfect , several countries have been able to build systems that allow a basic level of coexistence . What makes Facebook so untenable is that it has proven an inability to control or manage its insane growth . In the past ten years it has gone from millions of users to billions of users , from a simple website to apps , ads , messaging , shopping , publishing , donating and VR . The site and apps are changed and updated daily , with hundreds of algorithms rapidly developing and changing what information is shown to where , and to who . Never has a single company had such incredible control over the content shown to billions of people daily , without any oversight , regulation or active moderation . Consider the drama and fines when a single breast was shown on national television in the US during the super bowl a few years back , and yet Facebook escaped blameless when a spate of suicides and murders were shown on Facebook Live . It ’ s this lack of control that causes almost every major issue – the Cambridge Analytica data leak , election tampering , advertising manipulation – with traditional “ tech fixes ” , such as more algorithms , easily subverted by real people with much more creative methods to subvert these safeguards . There is just too much information flooding onto Facebook every second , too many unmoderated groups , public and private , too many easy methods to create authentic spoof accounts to fleece people out of their money . Thousands if not millions of jobs , small businesses and large companies rely on Facebook for communication . Local governments with little money can now reach vast numbers of constituents . Information that was once extortionately expensive to market is now significantly cheaper , interactive and shareable . Everyone has a story about how they rekindled old relationships , created new ones or managed to keep up with overseas relatives easily via Facebook . The network itself , at its core , is not evil . But its structure is far too large to avoid being subject to subversion , its operating team too arrogant and selfish to admit that it has no idea how to deal with what ’ s happening right now . So , back to the original question : should you delete Facebook ? The answer depends wholly on what you use it for . At the very least , it 's worth logging into your settings on mobile and desktop and checking your privacy – Facebook offers a simple wizard that checks the most obvious ones ( who can see your wall , pictures , email etc ) , as well as how easy you are to find on the site . The other ones involve looking at your app preferences – holding down the icon on Android and going into App Settings on iOS will show you what the apps can access . Outside of the Camera , Microphone and Storage ( for uploading photos/videos to Facebook ) almost everything else can be turned off . This also applies to Messenger , especially if you do not want Facebook storing your phone and texting metadata ( HINT : you don ’ t ) . It ’ s also worth going into the Apps section in Facebook settings and removing access for any games or quizzes or apps you don ’ t use anymore . After Cambridge Analytica , Facebook has heavily restricted developer app access to data so you might find soon that many of them will likely disappear anyway . You can also download what data Facebook stores on you here and if you ’ re a bit paranoid you can remove photos and videos from your profile . I found that deleted information was not stored in my archive , which is a plus , after reading some rumours that it was . But in all honesty , if you were going to delete Facebook you likely would have by now anyway . I still find many of its functions useful , including Events and Messenger which I use regularly , but I am a lot pickier about logging in via Facebook to sites , preferring to use email or my Google account as significantly less information is passed on in the process . I ’ ve also found myself providing much less information that isn ’ t necessary , such as my education or my hobbies , since this is usually just farmed for advertising or phishing anyway . My advice – use your common sense . Run an audit on your Facebook – tighten privacy , remove data you don ’ t want to know , reduce its access to your information flows and think twice about adding content you don ’ t want to share .

Facebook admitted today that Cambridge Analytica may have gained access to the private data of up to 87 million users , not the 50 million user figure that was previously reported . Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer revealed the new figure in a blog post focused on Facebook 's plans to “ restrict data access ” on the social media platform . The majority ( about 70.5 million ) of affected users are in the US , but the remaining 19 % are in several other countries , including the UK , Canada , Australia and India . “ We do not know precisely what data the app shared with Cambridge Analytica or exactly how many people were impacted , ” Facebook 's post states . “ Using as expansive a methodology as possible , this is our best estimate of the maximum number of unique accounts that directly installed the thisisyourdigitallife app as well as those whose data may have been shared with the app by their friends . ” This means that Facebook doesn ’ t know for certain which users shared their friends ’ Facebook data , and that the true number could be lower than 87 million . On April 9 , Schroepfer said in today 's post , Facebook will inform individual users whether or not they suspect Cambridge Analytica obtained their private data . Users will be able to click a link on the top of their News Feed that provides this information . They 'll also be able to `` see what apps they use — and the information they have shared with those apps '' , and then delete those apps if they so choose . This news comes on the heels of the announcement that Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the US Congress ' Energy and Commerce ( E & C ) Committee on April 11 . No doubt the committee will have many questions about how Facebook arrived at the new 87 million estimate . Last week , Facebook revealed how it would make it easier for users to find their privacy settings and linked apps with access to their private data . In today ’ s blog post , Facebook announced plans to go much further , limiting what information third-party apps can access even if users give the apps permission . In particular , the days where you could inadvertently give apps information on your Facebook friends are over . For example , apps could previously access your events , including private guest lists and posts . Now , if you grant access to your events , apps can only see that you are attending and any public information , but not any private content . This new rule also applies to other Facebook features like Groups or Pages ; by protecting these member lists from the data requests of a single user or admin , Facebook ensures that companies can ’ t find ready-made lists of political activity for selfish or nefarious purposes . Most importantly , Facebook is preventing seemingly innocuous quizzes , like thisisyourdigitallife , from asking for any personal details that could be used to develop a profile on users . Specifically , Facebook will “ no longer allow apps to ask for access to personal information such as religious or political views , relationship status and details , custom friends lists , education and work history , fitness activity , book reading activity , music listening activity , news reading , video watch activity , and games activity . ” Moreover , if you haven ’ t used an app or game for more than three months , Facebook will ban that app from asking for the latest updates on your life . Facebook has also disabled the ability to search for your friends using a phone number or email address . Schroepfer said that “ malicious actors have also abused these features to scrape public profile information by submitting phone numbers or email addresses they already have ” , and that “ most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way. “
In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal , in which information from more than 50 million Facebook users was harvested without permission , it 's a good time to check which organizations have access to your details and remove any you are n't happy with . Until now it was necessary to select each one individually and view its details before disconnecting it . If you 've used Facebook for a long time , you might have authorized dozens of apps over the years , making that a long and arduous process . Thankfully , Facebook has recognized this problem and developed an easier option . To give it a try , visit your App Settings page and click all the apps that you 'd like to disconnect from your account . Then just click 'Remove ' . Third-party Facebook apps are n't always what they seem . Cambridge Analytica acquired data from millions of users via a personality test called 'thisisyourdigitallife ' developed by researcher Aleksandr Kogan . This app gathered information from each user 's friends , but in violation of Facebook 's Platform Policy , Kodan then sold it to research company Cambridge Analytica . CA then used it to predict voting patterns for the 2016 US presidential election , and target voters with highly specific advertising . Facebook is currently busy trawling through apps that had access to similar data before 2014 ( which it put an end to the practice of sharing friends ' data ) and has promised to ban any developers that do n't comply with its investigations . Disconnecting apps wo n't delete any data that their developers have already collected , but it 's a sensible move if you do n't use the app regularly to avoid giving away your details unnecessarily . Apps can also change hands , so your information might now be handled by an organization you do n't know .
Facebook has released an update that ’ s supposed to counter the proliferation of fake news . If this song sounds familiar , it ’ s because it ’ s not the first time the social media company has sung it . The difference this time is that the tool takes a slightly more personal approach . Unlike previous features that have populated a counter argument as a ‘ read more ’ or put flags against possible fake news , this new feature allows you to learn more about where the story has been shared and who has shared it . That ’ s right , by tapping on a little ‘ i ’ hovering over the news story on your News Feed you can see a map of where this story has been shared , and a list of which of your friends has shared it . Of course , you ’ ll have to find out for yourself if the story has been shared ironically by doing some investigation . Although if you ’ re the sort of person who investigates before reacting , you ’ re probably not the user that is most in need of a Fake News detection tool . What seems like a much more likely outcome is a greater division of socio-political groupings , as it ’ s suddenly possible to point the finger at your friends that have a certain political , religious , or tinfoil-hat wearing leaning . At a time where lines in the sand seem to be drawn deeper than usual , we wonder if a tool that stands to drive us further down the potential narcissistic echochamber is a good thing . After all , how kindly would you take to a message from Derek from accounts telling you you ’ re wrong ? The new feature is currently just rolling out in the US , we 'll keep you updated if it gets rolled out globally . Via The Next Web

Messenger Kids , Facebook 's chat app for pre-teens , no longer requires parents to be on speaking terms before their offspring can start a conversation . Children can only use Messenger Kids to chat with a list of contacts approved by their parents . Before now , if two kids want to message one another , their parents could only grant permission if they were friends themselves on Facebook . It was a handy way to make sure your little ones only spoke to people you knew and trusted , but also meant their social circles were limited unless you befriended half the people you saw at the school gate . You might be nodding acquaintances , but do you really want to hear their political views and be inundated with their Farmville invitations ? Both parents still need Facebook accounts ( Zuckerberg and company wo n't let you get away that easily ) , but you can now make and authorize requests without being forced to expand your own social circle . Just search for the other parent 's name to send an invitation and wait for them to respond . Messenger Kids is available for Kindle Fire , Android and iOS , exclusively for users in the US .

Despite a very vocal Twitter movement to # DeleteFacebook , new findings from investment bank and financial services company Goldman Sachs have revealed that the Cambridge Analytica data scandal , which saw the private information of up to 87 million Facebook users harvested and used to influence the 2016 US Election , had very little impact on the social network 's traffic . As reported by Business Insider , usage actually increased during its most difficult and scrutinized period , with the firm citing comScore numbers that point to a 7 % year-on-year rise in mobile traffic from unique users in the US this past April , bringing the total to 188.6 million American users . Growing user numbers are n't the only thing Facebook has to sing about — time spent on the app has also seen an increase , as you can see from the comScore graph below . Citing its own advertising system checks , Deutsche Bank has also revealed that Facebook 's mass-purging of over 583 million fake accounts has shown “ little to no impact on audience reach ” across the network . In a statement on the matter , Deutsche Bank said , “ We note that this data represents audience reach across properties , not strictly tied to core Facebook , but we suspect they are cleaning up fake accounts across the board and view this as a broad indication that ad reach across Facebook continues to grow . ” Along with the numbers cited above , Facebook 's share price has also seen a full recovery post scandal , with shares trading at $ 182.68 at the time of writing .

In March , following Facebook ’ s infamous data privacy scandal , CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a full audit of all Facebook-connected apps . “ We need to make sure that there are n't any other Cambridge Analyticas out there , or folks who have improperly accessed data , '' Zuckerberg said . Unfortunately , it appears there may have been others , as the audit has uncovered another 200 Cambridge Analytica-type apps out there . Facebook has suspended these apps , pending further investigations into each app developer ’ s potential data misuse . In a blog post titled “ An Update on Our App Investigation and Audit ” , Facebook VP of Product Partnerships Ime Archibong discussed the results of the company 's probe into apps that “ had access to large amounts of [ user ] information ” , before Facebook restricted unfettered data access in 2014 . To inspect each app , Facebook ’ s security teams are using a combination of remote interviews , information requests ( RFIs ) about what data an app-maker still has stored , and on-site inspections . The investigation , which Archibong says is “ in full swing ” , has covered thousands of apps so far ( no word on how many apps Facebook has left to scrutinize ) . Out of those thousands , he says , “ around 200 have been suspended — pending a thorough investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data . ” If Facebook discovers an app has misused data , it will instantly “ ban ” the app , and then post information on this page to let users know if the banned apps had access to their data . While Archibong admits that “ there is a lot more work to be done ” to find all potential violators of Facebook ’ s policies , “ we are investing heavily to make sure this investigation is as thorough and timely as possible . ” Outside of that key 200 figure , Facebook ’ s revelations leave a lot of important details out . For one , what criteria did Facebook use to decide if an app should be suspended ? Were these 200 apps chosen simply because they requested or acquired user data , or because Facebook already has evidence or suspicion that they held onto and sold the data ? If the former , the final tally could ( hopefully ) end up much lower than 200 . We also don ’ t know what criteria Facebook will use to determine whether a company is in violation of its policies , or how extensive each individual examination will be . It ’ s even unclear whether or not Facebook auditors will have the ability to ascertain for certain that a developer misused data . In 2016 , Facebook believed CA when it said that it had deleted the data it had stored , only to find out the truth in 2018 after a whistleblower came forward . Ideally , Facebook 's in-person inspections of these hundreds of app-makers will turn up the truth sooner rather than later . And , of course , we don ’ t know yet how long it ’ ll take for Facebook to uncover which users had data obtained by these apps . Facebook took some time to publicize which Facebook users CA had data on , and still hasn ’ t revealed which users had data scraped by Canadian consultancy firm AggregateIQ . It may be months or longer before we know for certain which of the 200 apps got access to our personal data . But these 200 apps will undoubtedly add to the 87 million users affected by Cambridge Analytica alone .

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are hot topics right now , and it looks like Facebook does n't want to be left in the dust of the new digital currency future . Facebook is reportedly looking into making its own cryptocurrency , according to people familiar with the plans who spoke with Cheddar . Facebook 's virtual monies would be used to make payments online . Facebook runs a Marketplace service , and we could see Facebook 's cryptocurrency serving as a form of payment here , as well as in other applications . According to one person , Facebook is `` very serious about it , '' referring to developing its own cryptocurrency . This would n't be Facebook 's first foray into digital currency . Facebook in the past offered Facebook Credits , a way to pay for games and other items electronically . Facebook Credits fizzled out after two years . Facebook 's crypto dreams seemed to be on hold , until earlier this week when the social network announced a major executive reorganization . As part of the news , it was revealed that Facebook now has a blockchain division , run by David Marcus . Marcus had been in charge of Facebook Messenger , but previous to Facebook was president of PayPal . Blockchain is the database used by a number of digital currencies to track large volumes of transactions and keep them secure . That Facebook would form a team specifically dealing with blockchain is especially intriguing , and a clue the company is indeed interested in developing some form of cryptocurrency . We 'll keep our ear to the ground for further developments on Facebook 's cryptocurrency plans , but it could be some time before these come to fruition .

Facebook has announced it is setting up a new team to investigate the use of blockchain technology . The social media giant revealed it has created an internal group looking at the potential of blockchain within its business , making it one of the biggest companies in the world today to confirm interest in the technology . Reports say that the team is small , numbering only around a dozen people , but contains several senior employees and executives , including Instagram VP of engineering James Everingham , and Kevin Weil , VP of product at the photo-sharing service . Most intriguingly , the team will be headed up by former Facebook Messenger chief David Marcus . Marcus confirmed the move in a post on his personal Facebook page , highlighting the growth seen by Messenger in his time at the helm , with Messenger ’ s current head of product , Stan Chudnovsky , taking over in his place . Marcus ' move is notable for several reasons . Before joining Facebook , Marcus was president at PayPal , gaining a wealth of experience in the online payments space that could be ideal in expanding a move into cryptocurrencies . During his time leading the Messenger division , Marcus helped grow the service into a standalone app from Facebook , imbuing it with a number of new services and tools , including the ability to send money to contacts .

“ This has been an intense year , ” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg quipped on Tuesday morning . “ I can ’ t believe we ’ re only four months in. “ Zuckerberg chuckled as he uttered these words to kick off F8 2018 – a self-deprecating acknowledgement of the fire Facebook has come under in the wake of the massive Cambridge Analytica data scandal , one that saw Zuckerberg testify before Congress and a wave of Facebook policy changes arise in its wake . “ I know that it hasn ’ t been easy being a developer these last couple of months , and that ’ s probably an understatement , ” Zuckerberg told the large crowd of devs gathered in San Jose , California . “ But , what I can assure you is that we ’ re hard at work making sure that people don ’ t misuse this platform so you can all keep building things that people love . ” Misuse turned out to be a common theme at this year ’ s F8 . Facebook ’ s stance seems to be that its platform is fundamentally good , but there are bad actors out there who want to exploit its users . “ It ’ s not enough to build powerful tools , ” Zuckerberg said . “ We need to make sure that they are used for good . ” 'What happened with Cambridge Analytica was a major breach of trust ' Facebook has had a number of high-profile scandals rock user trust in the platform in recent months , including revelations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and Cambridge Analytica improperly obtaining the data of up to 87 million Facebook users . “ What happened with Cambridge Analytica was a major breach of trust , ” Zuckerberg said on stage . “ An app developer took data that people had shared with them and sold it . So , we need to make sure that this never happens again . ” Cambridge Analytica , which worked for President Donald Trump ’ s campaign during the election , announced on Wednesday that it ’ s shutting down . The sobering reality for Facebook is that it ’ s more powerful than ever in terms of the number of people who use its platform and the influence , both good and bad , that it yields . The challenge Facebook faced at the conference and one it will continue to face going forward is how to thread together its optimism about connecting people with the reality that people have figured out how to use its platform for their own gains . During a separate talk on security at Facebook , Alex Stamos , the company ’ s chief security officer , acknowledged that there can be instances of people using Facebook products in a technically correct manner , yet with the aim to carry out ill will . Facebook has woken up to this fact , and has taken a number of steps to address its security and privacy flaws , including restricting the data that developers have access to and giving users an easier way to control their privacy settings . One new tool in the works that Facebook announced at F8 is a Clear History feature that will let users wipe their browsing history from Facebook . When it rolls out in a few months , you ’ ll be able to see what websites and apps send your browsing history to the social network . You ’ ll then be able to clear this information from your account and make sure no such data is stored in connection with your account in the future . However , this isn ’ t a complete deletion of your browsing history ; your data will still be gathered in an aggregate form and sent to developers and websites , Facebook said . In announcing the feature , Zuckerberg was quick to point out that , “ Facebook won ’ t be quite as good as it relearns your preferences . ” Still , something like Clear History is a widely requested feature , and one that ’ s likely to get plenty of use . Facebook didn ’ t shy away from addressing the many elephants in the room at this year ’ s F8 , it ’ s biggest conference of the year . It took some of the blame , particularly in terms of not acting more quickly in certain instances and in failing to anticipate how its platform could be used by nefarious actors . This was , in some ways , a more grown-up version of Facebook than we ’ re used to seeing at F8 , a conference that has in the past been more of a celebration , with ample time spent talking about internet drones and selfie sticks in VR . The enthusiasm was no doubt still there , but there was also an acknowledgement of the responsibility Facebook has to its users and society at large , one it can ’ t afford to ignore . What ’ s more , there was the acknowledgement that mistakes will happen again . “ I believe that we need to design technology that helps bring people closer together , ” Zuckerberg said . “ There ’ s no guarantee that we get this right . This is hard stuff . We will make mistakes , and they will have consequences , and we will need to fix them . But , what I can guarantee is that if we don ’ t work on this , the world isn ’ t moving in this direction by itself . ” Can Facebook balance the optimism it effuses about connecting people with the reality that it ’ s in a security “ arms race ” ( Zuckerberg ’ s words ) with “ adversaries ” ( again , his word ) who challenge the platform every day ? Whether Facebook wants to or not , the reality is , it has to .
It ’ s been a busy week for Facebook , fresh from its Cambridge Analytica backlash it ’ s put on a brave face and used F8 to steer the conversation away from what it does with your data and on to what it wants to do with VR . Its Oculus Go headset is a big step in the right direction for VR : free from tethers , lightweight and , most importantly , inexpensive . But VR goggles are nothing without something to watch on them . Facebook is hoping to make this experience a whole lot better by teaming up with camera manufacturer RED to develop the most realistic virtual reality experience yet , using Facebook ’ s Surround 360 technology . At F8 , a link-up with Oculus and RED was announced , with the hope that the end result will be a pro-level virtual reality cinema camera . It 's hoped the camera would be able to film footage with six degrees of freedom ( 6DoF ) - the effect you need if you want to not just fully immerse yourself in VR but actually walk , skip or jump through it . “ Facebook ’ s industry-leading depth estimation technology captures full 3D information about all objects in scenes to deliver a complete 3D reconstruction , ” says Facebook . “ Add in 6DOF capture - the ability to simultaneously film multiple angles from within a given volume - and you can generate infinite perspectives from any direction within a field of view so your audience can explore the scene freely . ” Six degrees of freedom is nothing new in VR , but it is something that ’ s usually used in gaming , not in TV or movie production . If Oculus and RED can pull it off , then this may mean some dramatic changes to how users interact with VR . The reason Facebook chose RED to partner with is because of the high pixel count of the company ’ s cameras - its camera sensors can pick up to 16 stops of light to provide so the level of detail , depth and color accuracy is hopefully enough to blend in with Facebook ’ s 3D rendering . The best bit about the news is that RED will also offer a complete end-to-end solution - so editing and production tools from Adobe , Foundry , and Otoy will be included . Via RoadToVR
UPDATE : Although Cambridge Analytica , as a company , has closed its doors in the UK and the US , there are indications that the company may have been rebranded as Emerdata Limited . It 's currently registered in the UK as an active company located at the same premises as SLC Elections and run by the same management , dealing with `` data processing , hosting and related activities '' . Our original story continues below : Cambridge Analytica , the consulting firm in the center of the Facebook data-abuse scandal , has announced that it 's shutting up shop . In a statement published on its website , the firm has said that is will begin bankruptcy proceedings not only in the US , but also in the UK , where it operates as SCL Elections . According to the statement , the media attention following accusations of improper data mining and the ensuing legal battles have lead to the company losing clients and money . Cambridge Analytica commence insolvency proceedings and release results of independent investigation : https : //t.co/BeDLpU1gIhMay 2 , 2018 Despite Facebook admitting that data from 87 million users was harvested for political analysis , Cambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing , claiming it “ has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and , despite the Company ’ s efforts to correct the record , has been vilified for activities that are not only legal , but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas . ” The firm believes that “ its employees have acted ethically and lawfully ” and blames the “ siege of media coverage ” for the loss of “ virtually all of the Company ’ s customers and suppliers ” , forcing Cambridge Analytica to go into administration . Cambridge Analytica was founded in 2013 to focus on US elections and had the financial backing of prominent Republican donor Robert Mercer , who fed in US $ 15 million to help the Trump campaign . Since its set up , the firm has provided consumer research and targeted advertising to political and corporate clients . While Cambridge Analytica claims it is innocent , the company has promised to help investigations into the data-mining scandal . The shutdown came into effect on Wednesday , May 2 , and employees were asked to hand over all company laptops and other assets .

During the opening F8 2018 keynote , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off the company 's latest Instagram updates : Spotify integration , AI-based anti-bullying comment filters , AR camera effects and four-way video chat . During the Day 2 keynote , Facebook revealed how your daily Instagram updates are giving its AI technology a deep-learning crash course in image recognition—one that ’ s apparently made its AI even smarter than Google ’ s at categorizing objects in photos . Facebook pulled this off , amazingly enough , by instructing its AI to read photo hashtags and interpret photos ’ subject matter . Using this strategy , called “ weakly supervised training ” , Facebook 's AI achieved a record 85.4 % accuracy rating on an industry-wide test of image recognition , beating out Google ’ s previous record . A Facebook Engineering blog post went into detail on the methods . Facebook gave the AI 3.5 billion Instagram images to learn from , labeled with 17,000 hashtags for categorization . Facebook then trained the AI to push aside nonvisual or vague tags and focus on ones that provide the most specific categorization . The team was able to train their AI using this method in just a few weeks by spreading the process across 336 GPUs at once . Compared to the usual method of teaching AIs to categorize photos using visual clues , this method was much faster and less labor-intensive . A “ supervised learning process often yields the best performance results , ” the post reads , “ but hand-labeled data sets are already nearing their functional limits in terms of size . Scaling up to billions of training images is unfeasible when all supervision is supplied by hand . ” Thus , while most object recognition software can figure out that a subject in a photo is a bird , Facebook ’ s AI will use hashtags or captions to figure out that it ’ s actually , say , a Meadowlark . Some important things to note , in light of Facebook ’ s recent privacy scandal : Facebook ’ s engineers only used public photos to train its AI—nothing from private accounts . Plus , the AI is focused on object recognition , not facial recognition . So , it won ’ t be using hashtags to figure out which of your Facebook friends is your # bff . Instead , it ’ ll be using this information to improve automated audio captions for the visually impaired . And the engineers also foresee “ using AI to better understand video footage or to change how an image is ranked in Facebook feeds ” , or to “ improve the way we resurface Memories on Facebook ” . Overall , Facebook ’ s AI technology has been a major focus of F8 2018 . On Tuesday , Facebook revealed that its Messenger AI assistant could now automatically translate messages in other languages . And today , Mike Schroepfer , Facebook ’ s Chief Technology Officer , said at F8 that the company uses AI to automatically remove spam , fake accounts and propagandist content from Facebook , including “ two million pieces of ISIS and al-Qaeda content ” .
The progression in how users are represented in virtual reality ( VR ) has come a long way since the floating blue blobs of those early days , but Facebook wants it to go even further . During the Day 2 keynote at F8 2018 , Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer took a few minutes to discuss how the company is working to develop ever-more realistic VR avatars , which represent users when using products like Oculus Rift and Oculus Go . One area where Facebook has improved is in mouth tracking , helped along by advancements in the company 's artificial intelligence ( AI ) and VR technologies . By more closely matching the actual mouth movements of users when they 're speaking , the digitally rendered avatars appear more life-like . But , Schroepfer noted , avatars still are n't indistinguishable from reality , and to that end he said Facebook is working on photo-realistic renderings of users that take place in real-time thanks to AI . As you can see in the image above , Facebook 's cartoony avatars are replaced by much more realistic representations , though there 's still something computerized about the renderings that keep them from looking truly life-like . Crucially , though , these new avatars could pick up on expressions that cartoons simply ca n't , allowing users to not only express themselves more accurately in a VR space , but allow for deeper connections with other users . Of course , go too far into photo-realism , and you enter uncanny valley territory , so it 's a fine line Facebook will have to walk as it looks to create avatars that more accurately represent its VR users . Schroepfer did note this work is still in the early stages , so we 're likely a ways off before photo-realistic avatars start popping up in experiences Oculus Rooms and Facebook Spaces . Schroepfer also offered a quick tease of one of the most intriguing products in the Facebook and Oculus roadmap : Project Santa Cruz . Schroepfer said the wireless , standalone headset is in the hands of third-party developers right now and that Facebook will have `` exciting updates '' to share later this year . He left it at that , but the timing of `` later this year '' would line up with the Oculus Connect conference , which usually takes place in October . It would n't surprise us at all to see a final version of Project Santa Cruz unveiled then , and possibly have the headset go on sale at that time . We tried Project Santa Cruz ( likely a codename ) at last year 's Oculus Connect and were impressed with its ability to track you around a room and its lack of a wire . This allowed near-total freedom of movement without a major drop-off in the quality of the experience . The standalone Oculus Go just went on sale , and while it offers affordable and accessible VR , we 've still got our eyes on Project Santa Cruz and the VR experience it promises to offer .
Facebook has already pushed back the launch of its smart speaker , but now it looks like when it does launch it ’ ll avoid the US , at least to start with . According to a report from CNBC , Facebook was originally planning on using its F8 conference to launch a pair of smart speakers , but pushed the launch back due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal , and when they do launch , Facebook may start with an ‘ international ’ launch first . Read more : Klipsch The Three with Google Assistant speaker The speakers – one of which we ’ re expecting to be a smart display device akin to the Echo Show and the other a more traditional smart speaker in the vein of the Google Home – will be powered by a voice assistant borne out of the ‘ M ’ feature you may know from Facebook messenger . M was a digital assistant that was able to take cues from your messages and prompt features like direct payment if you discussed money . M was shelved in January as a Messenger assistant but lives on in other forms , like a newly touted translation feature . One of the major concerns with M in Messenger was the fact that it was always ‘ listening ’ , monitoring everything you said , feeding into a fear of constant observation . We were told in no uncertain terms by Facebook ’ s VP of Messaging David Marcus that M wasn ’ t harvesting your conversations in order to serve you adverts , but the fear is a difficult one to shake . What ’ s interesting is that this is the exact same fear that many people have about smart speakers ( whether founded or not ) , and with the close scrutiny that Facebook is currently under in the US , it seems a fear the social media giant is keen to circumnavigate . If this rumor does hold to be true , we ’ ll be interested to see which markets Facebook does target , as the UK is currently as wrapped up in the data scandal as the States , and without those two major audiences , it ’ s difficult to imagine Facebook making waves in a field already dominated by Amazon and Google .

Facebook ’ s ongoing Cambridge Analytica data scandal may have delayed its smart home speaker ’ s release date , but the social network 's annual developer conference went on as planned . CEO Mark Zuckerberg started off the F8 2018 conference with a protracted apology for Facebook ’ s role in Russian election-meddling and third-party acquisitions of personal data , explaining Facebook 's new privacy security settings along the way . Having addressed the elephant in the room , Zuckerberg jumped into Facebook ’ s newest products , services and features . Lucky for you , we 've rounded up the seven most important announcements from the F8 2018 Day 1 keynote right here . In a not-so-surprise announcement , Zuckerberg informed the San Jose , California conference crowd and those watching via livestream that Oculus Go is on sale today on Oculus.com . People in 23 countries , including the US , UK , Australia , Canada , Denmark , Finland , Norway and Sweden , can go on the site and purchase the standalone headset right now . Shoppers in the US can also find Oculus Go on sale at Amazon , Best Buy and NewEgg as well as at Best Buy retail stores today . On stage , Zuckerberg called the Oculus Go the “ first really affordable ” VR headset on the market , and claimed it has the “ highest quality lenses and optics that we have ever built into a VR device ” , including the latest Oculus Rift . The base 32GB model costs $ 199 / £199 / AU $ 299 , while the 64GB version sells for $ 249 / £249 / AU $ 369 . And over 1,000 Oculus Go games and apps are available to play right now . Facebook doesn ’ t just want to be the place to chat with family members and old school friends anymore . Soon , you ' l ' be able to build a Facebook dating profile and connect with other singles in your area—in a part of the app that your regular Facebook friends can ’ t see . If you opt into the feature , you ’ ll be able to set up a dating profile , then search your area for Events and Groups where you 're likely to meet potential daters . Select a group , and you ’ ll be able to click on members ’ profiles and see their photos and stated interests . You can then click on one of their photos as a “ conversation starter ” and initiate individual chat chains with other users , which will be text-only ( no chance for unsolicited photos ) . Facebook will also recommend potential matches “ based on dating preferences , things in common , and mutual friends ” , but Zuckerberg emphasized that it won ’ t pair you up with any actual Facebook friends . “ This is going to be for building real , long-term relationships , okay ? Not just hookups ! ” Zuckerberg said , to laughs from the crowd . Zuckerberg implied that this will be available through the Facebook app , but Facebook Chief Product Officer Chris Cox mentioned that dating profiles could be available as a separate app , because focus groups wanted to keep their dating profiles separate from their regular profiles . Beta testing of the dating features will begin “ later this year ” . Facebook Messenger may be getting new features like 4K photos , AR effects and AI translation tech , but the platform 's upcoming interface revamp will clear away a lot of the clutter . VP of Messaging David Marcus showed off a quick glance at the new look on stage some time after Zuckerberg also said Messenger was due to get a simpler , cleaner look . Facebook plans to remove the games and camera tabs on the bottom , shrinking the friend bubbles a bit , and even adding what looks like a night mode option . Marcus hinted that this simpler , cleaner new interface will be coming out “ very soon ” . Thinking about deleting Facebook to protect your data privacy ? Facebook wants to give you a less drastic option to keep your business : clearing cookies and deleting browser history . In a few months , Facebook will roll out a “ Clear History ” option , which will let you turn off Facebook ’ s ability to store data on you . Normally , Facebook Analytics collects data on your browsing history and “ Likes ” , and uses this information to curate suggestions and ads for your feed . With Clear History , you ’ ll be able to wipe all of Facebook Analytics ’ collected information about you . Zuckerberg made it a point on stage to emphasize that the Facebook experience will be degraded if users opt to Clear History . Deleting cookies from a browser , he said , “ can make parts of your experience worse . Your Facebook won ’ t be quite as good while it relearns your preferences ” . In other words , Zuckerberg believes that Facebook needs data on your interests to properly function , and that after users delete their “ Off-Facebook History ” , they ’ ll realize they should trust Facebook with data again . In a separate statement , Erin Egan , Facebook ’ s Chief Privacy Officer , revealed that clearing your history won ’ t technically “ delete ” your data . If you do use this setting , she said , “ We ’ ll still provide apps and websites with aggregated analytics ... We can do this without storing the information in a way that ’ s associated with your account , and as always , we don ’ t tell advertisers who you are . ” So , by using Facebook , you ’ ll still be giving the company a means to monetize your data for advertisers . Facebook will just be making that data more generalized , so no one can easily obtain individual ad profiles on users . Zuckerberg also announced that it plans to hire 20,000 security and content reviewers by October 2018 to fight against fake news during election seasons . Oculus is pulling out all of the stops to ensure that Oculus Go owners have plenty of new , exclusive VR content to try out within their first month of purchase . Facebook , which owns Oculus , outlined the new and significantly updated apps coming to the platform . The first app , Oculus Rooms , has been around for awhile , but now it 's redesigned and all about making it easier than ever to hang out with friends in a virtual space to play games , watch movies , or otherwise catch up . It 'll be available for Oculus Go and Samsung Gear VR for now . Oculus TV , an Oculus Go-exclusive app , puts you inside of a virtual theater , where you can start a virtual “ Watch Party ” with up to four friends , and check out both 2D and 3D content , either live or on-demand . When it launches in May , you ’ ll be able to watch Netflix , Hulu , Showtime and Facebook Video , and other apps like ESPN+ will be added later this year . Facebook ’ s VP of VR , Hugo Barra , claimed that the TV screen inside the app can be set as large as 180 inches wide . You ’ ll also have access to live events through Oculus Venues , an app for virtually attending ticketed events like concerts , sporting events and theater shows . When it releases later this month for Go and Gear VR , Oculus Venues will debut live concerts , MLB and NBA games , and standup comedy shows . Finally , Oculus Gallery will let users easily share and view their own photos , video and other media inside virtual reality . At last year ’ s F8 , Facebook showed off its new augmented reality ( AR ) technology , which lets you insert 3D animated creations into your photos and videos . Now , the company has brought its AR Camera Effects suite directly into Instagram and Facebook Messenger , so you can add things like face filters , “ world effects ” or 3D objects into your feed . Facebook has also given these AR tools to businesses that use chatbots as part of a closed beta . Early partners like Nike , Asus , Sephora and Kia , will use 3D visualizations of objects to their products so you can see what they 'll look like from the comfort of your home . You ’ ll be able to put a makeup filter over your face to see what a certain shade looks like on you , for example , or check out how a Kia Stinger or pair of Nikes look in different colors . Confirming rumors from earlier this year , Zuckerberg announced that Instagram users can now use video chat to connect with people through the app . Up to four people can join the chat at once , and you ’ ll be able to browse around inside the app while your friends sit in a thumbnail in the corner . Part of that browsing will be in their revamped Explore mode , which places photo category buttons on the top of the window in a carousel , so you can quickly swipe through different options like “ Animals ” or “ Architecture ” and select one that strikes your fancy . Zuckerberg claimed that people has been using the live video feature to “ just hang out ” with friends , and that video chat was a logical addition to the platform . Facebook has also added a similar option to WhatsApp called Group Calling , which also allows up to four people onto one call . Zuckerberg said that people already make “ 2 billion minutes of voice and video calls on WhatsApp ” every day , and this new addition could add to that number .
With the proliferation of dating apps and the amount of information it has on users , it 's no surprise that Facebook , after 14 years in existence , is jumping into the pool of helping people connect ... romantically . The company announced at its F8 2018 developer conference today that it 's launching a dating profile feature , `` for real long-term relationships , not hookups , '' Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the keynote stage . People will be able to make a dating profile that 's separate from their Facebook profile ( a little heart icon will take you to your dating profile ) . Facebook assures the dating profile wo n't be visible to your Facebook friends , nor will it show up in places like the News Feed . Dating profiles will only feature a first name , and will highlights users ' interests and have some photos . Only people who use the dating service will be able to see other parties ' profiles . Users will also be able to browse events near them and groups involving things they 're interested in , reflecting how many people meet to date anyway . Potential romantic matches will also be suggested based on your shared interests , things in common and mutual friends , Facebook says . After finding someone you 're interested in , you 'll then choose a photo of theirs that acts a `` conversation starter . '' You and the person you 've contacted can have a private chat through an inbox that 's connected to your profiles and separate from Messenger and WhatsApp . What 's more , the conversation will be text-only , for safety reasons . Facebook is n't ready to launch dating profiles yet , and says it will share more details as testing begins in a few months . So , dating features wo n't be on Facebook soon , though you can expect their arrival before too long . Playing matchmaker shines a further light on the amount of personal user data Facebook has access to . In order to suggest potential matches to you , Facebook will need to know information including where you live , and what and who you 're interested in . Given the recent Cambridge Analytica data scandal , handing yet more information to Facebook may give some users serious pause . It 's imperative Facebook keeps the dating data of its users safe , and though it 's taken steps to address some of its privacy loop holes in the wake of scandal , Facebook may still have a lot to prove before users are willing to put their romantic fate in its hands .
Facebook Messenger is about to make it easier for people from other countries to communicate with one another in Marketplace . At the F8 2018 developer conference today , Facebook announced M Translations , a Messenger and Marketplace feature that gives users the option to translate foreign text into their default Messenger language . When translatable text comes in , Facebook ’ s AI will register that the text isn ’ t in your default language and send you a “ Translate to [ default language ] ” pop-up . If you tap it , you ’ ll receive the option to translate any text sent to you by the account in the future . The other person will then receive a notification that you ’ re translating their text , so they know you can understand them . Currently , only English-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-English translations are available , and only in the US . Facebook stated that “ we will launch this functionality in additional languages and countries ” in a press release , but didn ’ t give details on specific languages or a timeframe . When asked for further details , a Facebook representative noted the company currently `` [ does n't ] have a date to share '' , though it hopes `` to roll it out in additional languages/countries soon . '' As of now , M Translations will only available for Marketplace transactions , but Facebook plans to update the main Messenger app with M suggestions “ in the coming weeks ” . Facebook Messenger may have embedded games , Spotify playlists and tons of funny GIFs , but for Facebook , it ’ s all about business , which is likely why the Marketplace update was prioritized . Facebook 's 300,000 chatbots and adverts were built to sell stuff to users across the globe ; with this update , Facebook ’ s business partners will have easier access to a wider selection of potential customers . Adding translations will also finally bring Facebook ’ s chat service closer to Google Chat ’ s level for international communication . Google has offered translations for Google Chat , and for other Android phone apps like Facebook Messenger , since 2015 .
Augmented reality ( AR ) is helpful for letting customers see what they 're purchasing before hitting the 'buy ' button , and now Facebook is rolling out this useful feature to the Messenger app . Kind of . Launching in a closed beta , AR is coming to Messenger for businesses that use bots , or automated messaging systems to communicate with customers . By utilizing Facebook 's Camera Effects Platform , businesses can add brand-specific effects that their customers can engage with . All customers have to do is open the camera on their phone , and filters and AR effects pop up . The limited launch sees partners Nike , Kia , Asus and Sephora offering users a way to , for example , see a Kia Stinger in different colors , or what certain makeups look like on their face . There are no OS or hardware requirements for AR to work on Messenger , though again , this is a closed beta limited to certain partners for now . Users can then turn around and share the experiences with others in a group chat or one-on-one message , or in a Facebook Story . The idea is that friends and family can give feedback on the product , mirroring the shopping in-store experience one might have with someone whose opinion they value . According to Facebook , there are over 300,000 active bots on Messenger , and 8 billion messages are shared between people and businesses every month . It remains to be seen whether the new AR effects provide real value to customers or are merely a novelty , but it 's clear Facebook is actively developing its AR features . Apple 's ARKit and Google ARCore better watch out .

Facebook has patented some disturbing-sounding ideas over the years . Earlier this week , for instance , a newly-discovered Facebook patent revealed how an AI could predict major events in its users ’ lives—like the birth of a child or death of a parent—to better target ads . Read more : Devialet Phantom Reactor 900 review The company ’ s latest patent , discovered by Metro UK , takes the cake for creepiest proprietary idea , unveiling blueprints for using inaudible TV signals to trigger your phone ’ s mic , which would then secretly record your reaction to TV content and send it directly to Facebook . In this theoretical system , Facebook would lease out its hidden signal to companies to place in their TV commercials . Facebook would then analyze the recordings and inform companies whether TV viewers engaged with their ads . For example , Facebook would study whether people stayed to watch the ad or walked away to do other things ; or whether people actually talked about the ad or ignored it . In another example , Facebook said it could examine how many people watching content online skipped adverts using an ad blocker . In a statement to Engadget , Facebook VP Allen Lo said that this technology “ has not been included in any of our products , and never will be ” . This appears to be the same boilerplate language Facebook used to insist it wouldn ’ t use its patented plan to predict when we ’ ll die . In this case , Lo continued by saying that the patent was made “ to prevent aggression from other companies ” that could “ commercialize ” that technology themselves . During his April testimony to Congress concerning the Cambridge Analytica scandal , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg insisted that the idea that Facebook secretly taps into your microphones for targeted ads is a “ conspiracy theory ” . This patent won ’ t do anything to put that theory to rest . Keep in mind that Facebook isn ’ t the only tech giant to patent tech plans to violate privacy while keeping users in the dark . We ’ ve previously covered how Amazon and Google patented ways to secretly record your lives to build up advertising profiles on you . As far as we know , none of these companies have acted on these patents . Still , considering their ability to implement using morse-code signals and other impossible-to-detect tricks , we unfortunately have to rely on trust that they won ’ t .

Facebook holds a huge amount of your personal data - perhaps even enough to tell when you 'll get married , have children and die . To find out how much the site can extrapolate about its users ' lives , the New York Times plunged into the hundreds of patent applications Facebook has filed since it went public in 2012 . One of its most alarming - and fascinating - discoveries was the patent Predicting Life Changes of Members of a Social Networking System , which would use your recent online activity to forecast major personal events . According to the patent , `` A life change event , for example , may be a change in marital status , a birthday , a new job , a birth of a child , a graduation , or a death of a person associated with the user , just to name a few . '' The patent refers to communication data , including wall posts , instant messages and text messages , which could be scanned for key words indicating that something big is about to happen in your life . This information could then be used to target advertising more effectively . For example , if the algorithm determined that you were about to become a parent , it could shower you with ads for nurseries and diapers . Although Facebook users update their profile when something important happens , like an engagement or a marriage , it 's not very helpful to advertisers if that happens after the event has taken place . There 's no point trying to sell a wedding dress to a woman who 's already on her honeymoon . Although the potential might be there , a patent is n't the same as a plan , and few of the documents the NYT pored over have borne fruit . “ Most of the technology outlined in these patents has not been included in any of our products , and never will be , ” Allen Lo , a Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel , and the company ’ s head of intellectual property , told the newspaper . Still , it 's a poignant reminder to take a look at your privacy settings if you have n't done so recently , and make sure you are n't sharing any more data than you want to with the site and its advertisers .
Following Facebook ’ s massive privacy scandal , the European Union took a strong stance on the issue and passed the General Data Protection Regulation , or GDPR , to protect the data everyday users share with companies online . Despite that , large tech companies seem to have found a way around it , using duplicitous ways to trick users into sharing their data . According to a report entitled Deceived By Design published by the Norwegian Consumer Council ( Forbrukerrådet or NCC ) , Facebook , Google and Microsoft have been employing “ dark patterns ” , or design tricks , that manipulate the user into accepting privacy options they don ’ t necessarily want to accept . The 44-page report cites examples of how Facebook , Google and , to a lesser degree , Microsoft have used dark patterns to their benefit . These include “ privacy intrusive default settings , misleading wording , giving users an illusion of control , hiding away privacy-friendly choices , take-it-or-leave-it choices , and choice architectures where choosing the privacy friendly option requires more effort for the users ” . According to the report , if users choose to not accept some privacy policies , they are threatened “ with loss of functionality or deletion of the user account ” . For instance , if Google users want to turn off ad personalization , they are presented with reasons why they ought to keep the feature turned on , forcing the user to reconsider their choice . The negative effects of leaving ad personalization on is , however , never presented . Another example from the report talks about Facebook ’ s use of semantics and site design to force people into accepting the use of its facial recognition feature . The wording Facebook uses states that “ if you keep face recognition turned off , we won ’ t be able to use this technology if a stranger uses your photo to impersonate you . If someone uses a screen reader , they won ’ t be told when you ’ re in a photo unless you ’ re tagged ” . This forces the user to accept facial recognition by suggesting impersonation is a risk they ’ ll need to take if they refuse . In terms of design , the user is shown a blue box to accept facial scanning , but the option to decline is hidden within a page only accessible by clicking on “ manage data settings ” , making acceptance the easier option . Whether these double-dealing methods are legal or not is debatable , but letters sent by consumer groups across Europe , including France , Norway and the UK , to their respective national privacy regulators ask for investigations into the use of dark patterns . Consumer groups in the US have also asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into the matter . In fact , Bleeping Computer reports that an Austrian privacy advocate filed a complaint against Facebook and Google for exactly the same reasons within hours of GDPR going into effect , long before the NCC report was published . When asked to comment , Facebook chose to not to directly address any of the claims made in the report . Instead , a spokesperson simply said that the company ’ s “ approach complies with the law , follows recommendations from privacy and design experts , and are designed to help people understand how the technology works and their choices ” . Google also decided to tread the same path , not challenging the claims made , but stating that it is “ constantly evolving these controls based on user experience tests ” . If investigations are conducted and these companies are found guilty of underhandedness , they could be slapped with fines of up to €20 million ( $ 24 million ) or 4 % of their annual turnover .
As part of its ongoing efforts to improve the News Feed experience , social media behemoth Facebook is currently in the process of testing a new feature that will allow users to disable posts based on the words they contain . This new Keyword Snooze feature will work in a similar way to the platform ’ s existing snooze functions , which blocks posts from showing up on your News Feed for 30 days , whether they be from a person , a page , or a group . The Keyword Snooze tool differs in that it will give users the choice to block any post that contains the specific word ( or words ) that you choose . The primary purpose of this is to avoid spoilers for specific shows , movies or events , but the applications could spread to avoiding topics you ’ re simply sick of hearing about . While the feature has only just begun its testing phase , the approach Facebook has taken seems to have a slight flaw in its operation . In order to activate Keyword Snooze , you ’ ll need to click on a specific post ’ s menu option and select which of the relevant keywords from the post you ’ d like to shut down for the next 30 days . This implies you ’ ll need to have already seen the post , and hence , most likely , the spoiler itself , before you ’ re able to avoid future references . Regardless , if you ’ ve managed to catch the word “ spoiler ” at the beginning of a post , or seen that it has an image from your favourite Netflix show that you ’ re yet to catch up on , maybe you ’ ll be able to quickly activate the setting without having it ruined for you . As the setting is in testing , we ’ re yet to learn when it will officially arrive , but as with other News Feed alterations , expect to see it rolling out in the coming months to clumps of users at a time .

Facebook has ended its attempt to bring internet connectivity to the entire world through autonomous drones . The social media giant has announced it will be halting Project Aquila , which looked to get the four billion people without internet access online . `` When we started the Aquila program back in 2014 , very few companies were involved in this area , '' Facebook 's Yael Maguire wrote in a blog post announcing the news . `` It 's been exciting to see leading companies in the aerospace industry start investing in this technology too — including the design and construction of new high-altitude aircraft . '' `` Given these developments , we 've decided not to design or build our own aircraft any longer . '' The news will also mean the closing of a plant in Bridgwater , Somerset , although Facebook says it will continue working with partners like Airbus on related technology . First announced in 2014 , Project Aquila 's drones had the same wingspan of a Boeing 737 , but only weighed as much as a family car . Facebook 's tests saw the drones achieve 96 minutes of flight time over the Arizona desert , but it did n't advance much further than that , despite the company aiming to have it fly for 90 days . The craft was hoped to beam down internet connectivity across 60-mile packets of land , providing an online gateway to users that previously had no access .
Facebook has revealed a turnaround on its policy to permit adverts for cryptocurrencies on its site . The social media giant has said it will now be `` refining '' its policy and allowing certain adverts related to promoting cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin from pre-approved advertisers only . Any company looking to display such adverts will need to submit an application to Facebook , proving that they are trading on a public stock exchange and showing any licenses they have acquired . However the site will still ban companies looking to promote initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) and binary options . In a blog post announcing the news , Facebook product management director Rob Leathern said that the company would , `` listen to feedback , look at how well this policy works and continue to study this technology so that , if necessary , we can revise it over time . '' Facebook introduced its ban back in January as part of a clampdown on rogue ads . At the time , it said the ban would cover , `` ads that promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices , such as binary options , initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency . ” However Leathern notes that the company said it would look to revisit the `` intentionally broad '' policy as time went on . The news comes weeks after Facebook announced it would be setting up a new team to investigate the use of blockchain technology on the site .

Tech companies are apparently a lot more interested in our digital well-being these days , with both Android P and iOS 12 showing off features that tell you how much time you 're spending glued to your smartphone 's screen . Now it would appear that Facebook is getting in on the act too . TechCrunch discovered a page hidden away in the Facebook app for Android called `` Your Time on Facebook '' – as the name suggests , it tells you how much time you 're spending each day scrolling through updates from your friends . Read more : Funcl AI true-wireless headphones review There 's also the option to set daily usage reminders , so if you do n't want to use up too many hours liking and commenting , Facebook will step in with an alert . Again , this is similar to the app time limit features that Apple and Google are readying for the updates to their mobile OSes later in the year . Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that it is working on the feature , but there 's no guarantee it will ever appear to users – Facebook likes to experiment with changes and tweaks to its apps , but if they do n't sit well with the people testing them out , they can quickly get removed from the roadmap . The timing would certainly be right if Facebook did introduce something like this . Instagram , which is of course owned by Facebook , is also busy working on a similar feature to highlight just how much scrolling and liking you 're doing . Ultimately the likes of Apple , Google and Facebook want you using their products as much as possible – but they also want that time to be enjoyable and positive . If you 're not getting anything good back from your apps , that 's a problem for everyone .

Facebook ’ s new AI assistant , M , can now translate your Messenger conversations from Spanish to English , or vice versa , with the tap of a finger . All users in the United States or Mexico should now have access to this option . If any user sends you a message in a non-default language , the AI will recognize it and offer to translate the text to Spanish ( or English ) . If you say yes , M will then offer to auto-translate all future foreign-language messages in that conversation . Facebook first debuted M Translations back at the F8 2018 Conference in May , but only in the Marketplace . Sellers and chatbots can use M Translations to connect with more customers in foreign nations . Now , making virtual pen pals via Messenger with people from other nations just became a whole lot easier – well , assuming Facebook ’ s AI is as good as Google Translate at translating nonnative speech naturally . Facebook claims that it has plans to launch M Translations in other languages and countries , but hasn ’ t given any timetable on when or where that could happen . The M AI currently works in five languages and eleven countries , mostly English- or Spanish-speaking . Britain , Canada , Australia or Spain could all be future candidates for inclusion . Brazil and Portugal also have access to M Suggestions . Eventually , Portuguese-to-Spanish and Portuguese-to-English could be next on the agenda . Facebook is in the midst of some major changes to Messenger . Along with its AI additions , it plans on autoplaying video ads in Messenger to make more money off of the platform . It also added augmented reality tech to Messenger , as a way for businesses to show off 3D models of products for people to buy . Facebook ’ s preoccupation with translations may also have to do with its plans to launch its smart speaker in a non-US market . If the US-based company decides to launch in Spanish-speaking countries , for example , then the ability to communicate with users across language barriers could be vital to the launch ’ s success .
Fresh on the heels of news that Facebook ’ s Messenger service is trialing autoplaying video ads , the social media giant is now testing the waters with paid subscriptions to user-created groups . Administrators of certain groups will be able to charge between $ 4.99 and $ 29.99 a month for the privilege of being a member of their group and , hence , the ability to access the content within . “ We know that admins invest their time and energy to maintain their groups ” , the statement from Facebook reads . “ Some have told us that they would like tools to help them continue to invest in their community and offer more to members . ” Among the groups that will be a part of the trial are Declutter My Home , which does what it says on the tin , and Grown and Flown Parents , which provides members with counselling on college admissions and affordability . These and the other participating groups will be sharing their feedback with Facebook throughout the course of the monthly-subscription trial , predominantly to see how much demand is truly there when dollar-amounts enter the equation . As for Facebook ’ s motive , this is all apparently “ part of its overall approach to helping creators and leaders to financially support the work they do to engage their fans and communities . ” At this stage , none of the money from these subscriptions will be landing in Facebook ’ s pockets , the company is seemingly just intent on building and supporting these communities , but this is not to say it won ’ t profit down the line . This service will , however , operate via either iOS or Android and , as such , 30 % of the first year ’ s worth of subscriptions will be snapped up by either Apple or Google , dropping to 15 % after that . While the trial is currently closed to the selected pilot groups , if they prove successful and financially viable , we could soon start seeing an admission fee to some of our favorite Facebook groups .

After seemingly running out of space for ads in its newsfeed , social-media giant Facebook is now in the process of trialling autoplaying video ads in its popular messaging platform , Facebook Messenger . Alongside chats in your inbox from your friends , family members , and people-you-met-that-one-time , you ’ ll now be watching video commercials – a form of advertising that nets Facebook much more money than regular static ads . According to the social network 's first quarter earnings for 2018 , advertising was responsible for bringing in 98.6 % of the company ’ s total revenue , accounting for $ 11.8 billion in the first three months of the year . The trial for the feature commenced on Monday , June 18 , but as Stefanos Loukakos , Messenger ’ s head of advertising , told Recode , the company will be monitoring user response to the new format to determine whether it will stick around . “ We don ’ t know yet , ” he said when asked about how a wider rollout . “ However , signs until now , when we tested basic [ static ] ads , didn ’ t show any changes with how people used the platform. ” These static ads have been displaying inside Messenger for 18 months . Another message sent by Facebook ’ s team to BGR claimed the company “ will be rolling out video ads gradually and thoughtfully . People that use Messenger each month are our top priority and they will remain in control of their experience . ” For those not interested in integrated advertisements in their Messenger experience , you can try out Messenger Lite , or alternatively , one of the many other chat and messaging services that do n't contain ads .

Most people touch up their selfies to remove pimples or ruddy patches without a second thought . Facebook wants you to have the same attitude about removing pesky eyelids from photos , too . Using a machine learning technique called 'generative adversarial network , ' or GAN , Facebook researchers taught an AI to observe a picture in which you blinked , compare it to an unblinking photo of you , and then use “ in-painting ” to substitute your closed eyelids for open eyes . Facebook researchers Brian Dolhansky and Cristian Canton Ferrer released a paper Monday that detailed the process . Eventually , Facebook could add GAN as a feature to its Facebook or Instagram apps , though the paper does not suggest this is an option . Dolhansky and Ferrer taught their AI to match features like iris color , skin tone , eye contours and lighting . They then gave photos to participants in their study and asked them to pick which eyes were the originals . 54 % of the time , they either picked the in-painted eyes or couldn ’ t tell the difference . Dolhansky and Ferrer did admit that they had trouble generating eyes from some original photos , especially those whose subjects wore glasses or whose hair covered or overshadowed their eyes . They ’ re confident they can solve the issue with further tests . The study doesn ’ t make clear whether the “ participants ” were looking at their own photos or at strangers . People looking at their own selfies or at family snapshots may be more likely to spot an “ uncanny valley ” effect , as the researchers put it . Still , with further tweaking , this AI could make it possible to salvage those group photos where one person blinked or everyone squinted in the bright sun . Facebook isn ’ t the only tech company interested in using AI to significantly edit people ’ s features in photos . Adobe is working on an app that will take your selfies and automatically Photoshop them . It ’ s AI will intelligently study faces and use a telephoto lens to downplay certain features on your face . Beyond this photo-based plastic surgery , Adobe also uses AI to intelligently select and crop out objects in a photo , or to enhance low-res images by using AI to estimate what pixels are missing and then insert them automatically . Eventually , AI could be used to selectively pull features from your most flattering photos into some kind of realistic-looking amalgamate selfie , or to pull features from other people ’ s photos into your own . Combined with AI tech to simply edit your facial template to look more handsome or beautiful , and we ’ re about to get an influx of some very flattering , very unrealistic dating profile pics .

In the wake of secret data deals with smartphone makers , and a bug that turned private posts public for millions of users , Facebook is once again under fire : this time for the way it gave certain companies extended access to its network of information on users , through 2014 and beyond . The claims reported in The Wall Street Journal suggest Facebook kept a whitelist of partners who could access detailed data – even after the point when the social network said it had shut out this sort of access to developers . We already knew that detailed user data of this type escaped Facebook 's clutches beyond 2014 , when the platform first began to lock down what apps could do with the data they were getting . Now it seems Facebook knowingly gave certain advertising partners permission to carry on as before . Facebook has admitted the WSJ largely got its facts right , but insists that these extensions – given to the likes of Nissan and the Royal Bank of Canada – were intended to help companies adapt to the new privacy regulations . These extensions were short-term and have long since been terminated , Facebook says . In addition , according to Facebook , any deal extensions signed after that time were kept under the new restrictions – only friends lists could be shared with app developers , not private information such as user interests or personal photos . To cut a long story short , it seems Facebook gave a small number of companies more leeway than we previously thought when it came to adopting the new privacy regulations introduced in 2014 and 2015 . Even if that access has now been shut off , these are n't the kind of headlines Facebook will want to keep seeing .

Facebook is warning users to check their recent posts and photo uploads after discovering a bug in its composer that set the default privacy option to 'public ' . Usually it 's safe to assume that Facebook will use your preferred privacy settings , but unless you 're in the habit of checking every time , you may have inadvertently revealed far more than you intended . The bug affected posts published between May 18 and 27 . Facebook is keen to point out that no privacy settings were changed retroactively , so nothing posted before then will have been exposed to the world without you realizing . Facebook has now fixed the bug , and changed any posts made during that period to your usual privacy settings ( though that could be a case of shutting the gate after the horse has bolted , depending on how much fun you had in those 10 days ) . If there 's a chance you might have been affected , you 'll see a warning next time you log into Facebook , with an apology and list of posts you made during that period . Hopefully nothing you would n't want your boss , parents or partner to see . In a statement to TechCrunch , the company said it 's well aware that it needs to be more transparent about its privacy settings , and it 'll publish more of these alerts when things go pear-shaped . Hopefully that wo n't be too often . Via Ars Technica
After announcing an exclusive game streaming program in January this year , Facebook has now launched its very own answer to Twitch and other popular game streaming services . The new hub is dubbed FB.GG and will act as a homepage for all the game streaming content found on the social media platform . It ’ ll also be home to what Facebook is calling its “ gaming creators ” – gamers that the social giant has paid to exclusively stream on its platform . While the creator program has been in action for almost half a year , this new hub is designed to quickly and simply aggregate all gaming videos and live feeds , and Facebook also has future plans to add curated content such as game-related news and events . Facebook will be showcasing its efforts of community-building alongside some of its very own gaming creators at this year 's E3 convention in Los Angeles under the new banner of Facebook Gaming . With the exponential rise in popularity of services such as Twitch , which has seen close to half a million concurrent viewers tuning in to a single livestream , it ’ s unsurprising that Facebook wants to capitalise on the medium ’ s success . With the infrastructure for live video already in place , and the userbase well and truly established , will Facebook be able to take the throne from Twitch , or will the streamers and viewers remain loyal ?

Facebook has been called out for allowing a number of tech companies , including smartphone manufacturers , access to a sea of data about its users . Reports claim 60 device manufacturers , including the likes of Apple , Samsung , Microsoft and BlackBerry had partnerships with Facebook allowing them access to user data . In return , manufacturers could offer customers features like messaging or the 'like ' button . Read more : Degoo The problem with the deal , however , is that it breaks compliance with the 2011 consent decree from the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , and means that manufacturers could also access the data of users ' friends , without their unequivocal consent . According to the New York Times , some device makers could get data from users ' friends that believed to have blocked any and all data sharing . These partnerships are still active , even though Facebook started toning them down a few months back . Facebook defended its position , saying the partnerships are in line with its privacy policy , with the Federal Trade Commission 's agreement , and that it limited how the data could be used . “ These partnerships work very differently from the way in which app developers use our platform , ” said Ime Archibong , a Facebook vice president . Unlike developers that provide games and services to Facebook users , the device partners can use Facebook data only to provide versions of “ the Facebook experience , ” the officials said . Different companies said to have been using data for different purposes . Apple , for example , says it used the partnership to allow its users to post photos to Facebook without actually bringing up the app . BlackBerry said the deal was used to give customers access to their Facebook networks and messages .

Bad news for anyone who likes to add a touch of topicality to their news feed â€ “ Facebook is doing away with the custom reaction emoji that were sometimes available alongside the usual thumbs up , heart and smiley faces on special occasions . After users noticed the lack of a rainbow flag emoji to represent Pride month in the US , the company confirmed that it 's no longer offering extra icons for topical events . Instead , Facebook is focusing on profile picture frames , text backgrounds , filters and stickers to help users show their support for events . Unlike the special emoji , these decorations will be available year-round , which is useful for occasions like Mother 's Day that take place on different dates in different countries , and users create their own for a more personal touch . Last year , Facebook expanded its range of reactions beyond the humble 'Like ' button , adding 'Love ' , 'Haha ' , 'Wow ' , 'Sad ' and 'Angry ' based on users ' most common single-word comments . The latter two are getting quite a workout from users frustrated by the decision not to add the special Pride flag this year . Other limited edition emoji have included a purple flower , which was designed to help users show gratitude on Mother 's Day . Facebook also released a whole set of special Star Trek themed icons to celebrate the series ' 50th anniversary , but the feature neither lived long nor prospered . Via The Verge

Facebook is shuttering the much-maligned Trending topics section next week , noting it accounted for just 1.5 % of clicks to news publishers in the five countries where it was displayed in the News Feed . You 've likely noticed the Trending box in the upper right-hand corner of your News Feed page before , only to forget about it and never click on a link there again . Active since 2014 , the section highlighted three top news stories trending across the platform , though how Facebook decided which news items to include the box often came under scrutiny . The biggest controversy came in 2016 when former Facebook staffers reported they regularly suppressed conservative news topics in the Trending section , calling into question the feature 's legitimacy . In a blog post announcing Trending section 's removal , Facebook 's Alex Hardiman did n't wade into political bias territory , but instead noted that the way people consume news on Facebook has changed . `` From research we found that over time people found the product to be less and less useful , '' Hardiman said . In place of the Trending section , Facebook will focus on delivering high quality , reliable news via mobile and video , areas where it 's seen users gravitate to get their news fix . To that end , Facebook is testing several new features , including a breaking news label for news outlets , breaking news notifications , a Today In section and more news coverage in Facebook Watch . We 'll see if doing away with the Trending section and delivering more meaningful news does anything to improve user trust in Facebook . Small steps .

Despite facing a slew of controversies this year – from the Cambridge Analytica scandal , accusations of spreading violence in some countries , and spreading fake news – Facebook seemed to be on track with sales projections and profit estimates . Until this week . The social media platform ’ s second quarter earnings report showed it had lost approximately a million monthly users and 3 million daily users in Europe , with no user growth in the US . According to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , the implementation of the EU ’ s General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) is to be blamed . `` GDPR was an important moment for our industry , '' Zuckerberg said on Wednesday . `` Looking ahead , we will continue to invest heavily in security and privacy . This is our responsibility to keep people safe . '' Facebook ’ s shareholders and investors began unfriending the social media platform after the company ’ s chief financial officer , David Wehner , predicted that revenue growth would continue to be slow for a while , sending Facebook share prices plummeting as much as 24 % . The company warned its investors that a huge financial injection would be required to buttress the business to address the controversies it ’ s currently facing , with revenue growth expected “ to decline by high single-digit percentages from prior quarters ” . The drop in share price sent Mark Zuckerberg ’ s fortune tumbling by US $ 16.8 billion , which could send him sliding down the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . While Facebook faces the worst week in the company ’ s history , it still holds the world ’ s largest repository of user information . And although the loss of active users in Europe has hit its advertising revenue as well , the company insists the advertising part of its business is still strong According to the company , Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp show promise as new advertising platforms , although chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg doesn ’ t believe they ’ ll contribute strongly for a few years yet . Despite Facebook facing the hard truth behind user disenchantment , it still remains a profitable company and we definitely haven ’ t seen the last of it yet .

Facebook advertisers will no longer be able to target users based on their religion , sexual orientation or ethnic background in the United States , after the social media giant signed an agreement in Washington to overhaul their advertising practices . The deal concludes a two-year investigation by the Attorney General ’ s Office , which saw undercover investigators create a number of ‘ fake ads ’ that excluded one or more ethnic minorities from viewing their advertisements for restaurants , housing , insurance , and employment opportunities . All 20 were approved . Attorney General Bob Ferguson said that “ Facebook ’ s advertising platform allowed unlawful discrimination on the basis of race , sexual orientation , disability and religion [ ... ] That ’ s wrong , illegal , and unfair . ” Facebook has already implemented many of the changes needed in preparation for the agreement . In November 2017 , the site ‘ temporarily ’ suspended all exclusion options based on users ’ ethnicities . The Washington agreement requires Facebook to make the change permanent , while removing all other tools that “ discriminate based on race , creed , color , national origin , veteran or military status , sexual orientation and disability status . ” Facebook must meet the agreed terms within 90 days , in addition to paying the $ 90,000 legal fees of the Attorney General 's Office . The move signals progress for the social media giant , which is continuing to grow its user base even in the face of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and ongoing concerns over misuse of user data .

Four of the world 's largest technology firms have announced a new project aimed at making it easier to share data between different sites . The Data Transfer Project brings together Google , Facebook , Microsoft and Twitter in a bid to make portability of user data a smoother process . This means that transferring information between different platforms , such as from a Windows platform to Android , becomes a lot more straightforward and secure than ever before . `` Data portability makes it easy for consumers to try new services and use the ones that they like best , '' wrote Brian Willard , Software Engineer and Greg Fair , Product Manager , on a Google blog post announcing the news . `` We ’ re thrilled to help drive an initiative that incentivizes companies large and small to continue innovating across the internet . We ’ re just getting started and we ’ re looking forward to what comes next . The Data Transfer Project describes itself as , `` a collaboration of organizations committed to building a common framework with open-source code that can connect any two online service providers , enabling a seamless , direct , user initiated portability of data between the two platforms . '' The open-source project will also tick a useful GDPR box for the tech giants , as a key part of of the new regulation concerns the ability to gain access to data records with any company and transfer this elsewhere at any time . As for security , that will be the responsibility of the data provider , meaning you 'll still need to trust whichever company you 're looking to extract the data from , however the DTP says that individual credentials and user data will be encrypted during transition . The DTP site adds that it is still in development for the time being , and is `` not quite ready for everyone to use yet '' - however developers can add in certain features to their sites now , although DTP adds that , `` we are continually making improvements that might cause things to break occasionally '' .

Facebook is no doubt keen to let the Cambridge Analytica scandal fade into history , but its problems with third-party companies and data misuse continue . Crimson Hexagon is the latest analytics firm to be suspended by Facebook , pending an investigation into its use of data for `` surveillance '' purposes . Exactly what Facebook means by `` surveillance '' is n't clear , but it seems Crimson Hexagon has questions to answer over how aggressively it 's been tracking users on Facebook and Instagram . The company monitors social media sentiment for a roster of blue chip clients , and also has links to platforms like Twitter and Tumblr . For now it 's just a suspension – there 's no evidence of wrongdoing yet – but Crimson Hexagon was blocked from the Facebook and Instagram feeds after the Wall Street Journal raised questions about its connections to the US government , a Russian organization linked to the Kremlin , and the Turkish government . `` We do n't allow developers to build surveillance tools using information from Facebook or Instagram , '' said Facebook in a statement , the Guardian reports . `` We take these allegations seriously , and we have suspended these apps while we investigate Based on our investigation to date , Crimson Hexagon did not obtain any Facebook or Instagram information inappropriately . '' Whatever the outcome of the investigation , it 's a data privacy headache that Facebook could do without . On the other hand , Mark Zuckerberg and his exec team will want to be seen to be being tough on companies that do n't follow the rules in regards to harvesting personal information from social media . `` Crimson Hexagon is fully cooperating with Facebook , who has publicly stated its investigation to date has found no wrongdoing . '' said Crimson Hexagon 's Chris Bingham in a statement . The company has also put up a blog post explaining some of its data collection practices , which it says only include public data available to anyone on the web .

Once you ’ ve chosen a subscription service or social media network , it ’ s hard to give it up . Deleting Facebook means losing connections to friends , photos and memories . Cancelling Spotify Premium or Apple Music means losing all of your favorite playlists . In other words , you have a lot of data to lose and little to no means of transferring it from one proprietary service to another . But , in the wake of the European Union ’ s GDPR ruling , that might all change for the better . Microsoft , Google , Facebook and Twitter have set aside their differences and joined forces to create the Data Transfer Project , an open-source framework hosted on Github designed for `` helping users securely and seamlessly move their data between service providers . '' In a blog post , Google outlined the initiative ’ s goal of creating a “ small set of standardized data formats that can be used by anyone. ” Any participating company will give customers the option to convert their data from its proprietary API into the open-source format . Then , those customers can upload that data into another competing service , and subsequently delete their old service account without regret . “ Portability and interoperability are central to innovation , ” reads the Data Transfer Project mission statement . “ Making it easier for individuals to choose among services facilitates competition , empowers individuals to try new services and enables them to choose the offering that best suits their needs . ” In Microsoft ’ s separate blog post announcing the initiative , it emphasizes that “ strong privacy and security standards ” are a point of emphasis for the project . They aim to prevent unauthorized access to data , as well as ensure that people know what information they ’ re giving away and how it will be used . Following the Cambridge Analytica scandal , Facebook allowed users to download the data that it had collected from them . But now Facebook has taken the respectable step of letting users take that data to a competitor , if they so choose . Google emphasizes in its post that the current project members “ encourage the developer community to join us and help extend the platform to support many more data types , service providers , and hosting solutions . ” So , we could very well see other major tech companies join the group in the near future . On the other hand , the Data Transfer Project essentially makes it easier for customers to leave your service whenever they want . This could make it a hard sell for some companies to join up with the project . Nevertheless , with the European Union emphasizing strict , ethical data handling with its new laws , smaller companies may take advantage of this service and its founding members ’ massive resources , in order to better protect users ’ data . Companies might also hope that by joining up , they can convince the massive user bases of sites like Twitter and Facebook to switch to their services instead , using the shared data platform . But , will bigger companies like Apple join up ? Only time will tell , though consumers and lawmakers might pressure them into accepting data portability as the new industry standard .

We ’ re only a few hours into the first day , but there ’ s already been some big news at this year ’ s San Diego Comic-Con ( SDCC ) - DC has announced that its brand-new streaming service will be out later this year and cost $ 74.99 annually or $ 7.99 per month ( around £60 , AU $ 100 if/when DCU comes to the UK and Australia ) . The service , which goes by the name of DC Universe , will serve a few different functions that parallel other platforms . The first is that it will be a video streaming service similar to Netflix . It will have existing movies and shows set in the DC Universe as well as new shows going up every week , including Titans , Doom Patrol , Swamp Thing , Young Justice : Outsiders and Harley Quinn . On top of being a streaming service , DC Universe will also live up to its namesake by offering a Comixology-style library of comics for its users as well as an encyclopedia for the times you come across a character you ’ ve never seen before . The service won ’ t launch with every issue in DC ’ s massive library , but will instead include somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 titles . The final function , according to Craig Hunegs , president of Warner Bros. Digital Networks and president of business and strategy Warner Bros. Television Group , is that DC Universe will serve as a forum where fans of Supes , Bats and WW can have a place to chat about movies , shows , games and more . “ I believe that we ’ re creating something that will be a daily experience for people , ” Hunegs said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter . “ We ’ re going to have new series at least once a week , a new episode at least once a week , and we ’ re going to have new short form , scripted , non-scripted , behind the scenes content every day of the week . The comic book catalog will be updated regularly , the encyclopedia will be updated . There ’ s going to be tons of new content every day . ” The idea of a collective repository for DC content is a great one . For too long , fans have needed to scour the internet to find their favorite shows , movies and comics , often bouncing between different services to get their fix . The one aspect that should have folks nervous , however , is the forum aspect . DC understands that Twitter and Facebook are n't the best place to foster a sense of community among fans of specific characters , but there 's a chance that a singular platform might become insular and , eventually , toxic . According to The Verge , DC is already aware of that possible and claims that it will try to prevent that by moderating discussions in the community . We 'll have to wait until the Fall ( sometime between September and November ) of this year before we have the service in our gloved hands , but we 're definitely excited to try DC 's super-powered streaming service .
Despite Facebook ’ s often-stated intention of being a neutral and open platform , the social media giant has announced that it will begin removing any posts that contain misinformation with the motive of inciting violence . In a statement to CNBC , a Facebook spokesperson said that , “ There are certain forms of misinformation that have contributed to physical harm , and we are making a policy change which will enable us to take that type of content down . ” Technically , the policy will be implemented “ during the coming months ” , although it has already been used in Sri Lanka , where the recent spread of false information targeting the country ’ s Muslim minority has lead to multiple instances of mob violence . The new policy will target Facebook posts that contain text and/or images that are deemed to be deliberately inflammatory – specifically , posts that have the intent of `` contributing to or exacerbating violence or physical harm '' . So who makes the call on what 's acceptable speech and what 's not ? Along with the social media ’ s existing image-recognition technologies , Facebook says it will work with local and international organizations to both identify and verify the intent and veracity of the posts in question . While these external parties are yet to be identified , the matter of the impartiality of these organizations is obviously going to play a significant part in the success of the policy overall , just as Facebook itself promises to hold the same standard of neutrality . Employing such policies treads a difficult ethical line – one between the absolute freedom of expression that a neutral platform should ( in theory ) allow , and the equal opportunity of such expression that comes from the promised safety of the community as a whole . In a recent discussion with Recode , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that the company would draw the line at false information that didn ’ t deliberately incite violence or physical harm , instead simply making such posts less prominent . As an example , Zuckerberg raised the issue of Holocaust denial – a stance which he has said he personally finds repugnant , yet one that would be allowed on the site if it didn ’ t explicitly incite violence ( albeit in a significantly de-prioritized state ) . In a clarifying statement provided to Recode , Zuckerberg reiterated that he found the topic “ deeply offensive ” and that he “ absolutely didn ’ t intend to defend the intent of people who deny [ the Holocaust ] ” . “ Our goal with fake news is not to prevent anyone from saying something untrue — but to stop fake news and misinformation spreading across our services . ”

A landmark court case in Germany has tackled the difficult reality of death in the age of social media , ruling in favor of parents who wanted to access their deceased daughter ’ s Facebook account and messages . The country ’ s highest court ruled in favor of the parents whose daughter was hit by a train , as they wanted to determine whether her death was a suicide . If this was the case , the train driver would also be entitled to compensation . While there are obvious privacy concerns involved in relinquishing a Facebook user ’ s private messages – particularly for the other recipients of said messages – the court ruled that such digital content is equivalent to diaries or letters and should thus be inherited by the owner ’ s legal heirs . Despite the social media platform ’ s recent public and governmental scrutiny regarding its leaking of personal data to third-party companies , Facebook has denied the family access to their daughter ’ s data since 2012 when her death occurred . Instead , Facebook ’ s current approach is to memorialize a deceased user ’ s profile , allowing a “ legacy contact ” ( if set up ) to make some very minor adjustments such as pinning posts and changing the profile picture , or to flat-out delete the account . Regarding the ruling , Facebook issued a statement “ respectfully disagreeing with the decision ” and pointing to the ethical difficulty of the situation . “ We empathize with the family . At the same time , Facebook accounts are used for a personal exchange between individuals which we have a duty to protect . ” While this particular case offers a compelling justification for familial inheritance of personal data , there is plenty of potential for the same level of access to be exploited by family members if it were to be granted . The topic is somewhat of an ethical minefield as a result . With a vast and increasing portion of the world ’ s population maintaining a digital life and , as such , leaving behind a swathe of data when they die , the issues tackled in this court case will likely surface more and more frequently , especially with the increasing debates over the security of a user ’ s personal data .

Facebook has been warned that it could have faced much sterner punishment from UK watchdogs for its part in the Cambridge Analaytica data breach scandal . It was revealed earlier today that the social media giant had been hit with a £500,000 penalty from the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) following the revelation that it misused user data . However Facebook can count itself lucky that it avoided a much larger fine , which could have been the case if the case had been carried out under the spectre of GDPR . GDPR regulations , which came into force on May 25th , state that companies would face much harsher penalties for misuse of user data . The new legislation imposes a maximum fine of whichever is higher between the figure of €20m ( £17m ) , or four percent of the offending company ’ s annual global turnover . According to its last results , this means that Facebook could have been hit with a maximum fine of around £1.2bn . Instead of being charged under GDPR , Facebook was called up for for two violations of the 1998 Data Protection Act - first off for failing to safeguard the data of its users , but also for failing to inform its users that their data was being harvested .
For Facebook 's part in the ongoing Cambridge Analytica scandal , the UK 's Information Commissioner ’ s Office ( ICO ) has today stated its intent to fine the social network £500,000 , finding the company to be in breach of the country 's Data Protection Act . Specifically , Facebook is being fined for two breaches to the act , which the official ICO report lists as “ failing to safeguard people ’ s information ” and “ failing to be transparent about how people ’ s data was harvested by others ” . The final decision regarding the fine will be made after Facebook issues a response to the notice . The total fine of £500,000 ( $ 663,130 ) is the maximum possible amount that the ICO could have penalized Facebook . That 's due to the time period in which the breaches took place . If the incidents had occurred more recently – such as after the new European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) had taken effect – the company could have faced fines of £17 million , or even £1.4 billion ( around 4 % of its global turnover ) . From a broader perspective , that £500,000 amount pales in comparison to Facebook ’ s earning potential . Based on the earnings the company took in 2018 ’ s first quarter ( $ 11.97 billion ) , Facebook would be able to pay off the fine in just seven minutes . The penalty and resulting fine only comprise a small portion of the ICO ’ s report , which initially was undertaken to investigate the misuse of data during the UK 's EU referendum ( AKA , Brexit ) . As such , the “ investigation into data analytics in political campaigns ” has resulted in a number of other regulatory actions and recommendations . These include sending out 11 warning letters to political parties in the UK , “ compelling them to agree to audits of their data protection practices ” . The report also initiates the prosecution of SCL Elections Ltd , which is Cambridge Analytica ’ s parent company , “ for failing to properly deal with the ICO ’ s Enforcement Notice ” . The ICO 's chief , Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham , also issued a statement regarding the findings , saying that the UK is “ at a crossroads ” when it comes to data and privacy . “ Trust and confidence in the integrity of our democratic processes risk being disrupted because the average voter has little idea of what is going on behind the scenes . ” “ New technologies that use data analytics to micro-target people give campaign groups the ability to connect with individual voters . But this can not be at the expense of transparency , fairness and compliance with the law . ” “ Fines and prosecutions punish the bad actors , but my real goal is to effect change and restore trust and confidence in our democratic system . ”

Another day , another data breach . This time , it has affected 21 million users of the popular time capsule app Timehop . Timehop revealed that the attack , which took place on July 4 , has exposed the personal data , including names and email addresses , of practically its entire user base . Of those affected , a fifth – 4.7 million – also had a phone number attached to their account . The app works by plugging into your social media accounts , like Facebook , Twitter and Instagram , to bring up posts from years gone by . According to the startup , the hacker was able to grab keys and tokens that the app uses to access and display social media memories . The hacker was able to enter Timehop ’ s cloud computing account , which wasn ’ t protected by multifactor authentication — a basic security measure that was lacking . A preliminary investigation of the incident has revealed that the attacker first accessed Timehop ’ s cloud environment on December 19 last year by using compromised admin credentials and created a new admin account . The attacker returned for a look-see once more in December , then in March this year , followed by another survey in June , although the actual attack didn ’ t take place till Fourth of July came along . Timehop says the breach was discovered two hours after it was started and was able to interrupt the data transfer , although not in time to stop user data from being stolen . According to the startup , users ’ private messages , financial data , social media content and Timehop data were not compromised as it deletes copies of old posts and photos once they ’ ve been viewed . The company also doesn ’ t store information like credit card details , locations and IP addresses . Timehop ’ s access tokens and user data have not yet made an appearance on forums and the dark web , but the company has hired cybersecurity experts to track if they do . So far , no unauthorized access has been reported on any account and all keys have been deactivated . Timehop , in the meantime , has enabled multifactor authentication on “ all accounts that did not already have them for all cloud-based services , ” meaning there was possibly more than one admin account for the attackers to gain access with . “ We want to be clear that these tokens do not give anyone ( including Timehop ) access to Facebook Messenger , or Direct Messages on Twitter or Instagram , or things that your friends post to your Facebook wall . In general , Timehop only has access to social media posts you post yourself to your profile , ” the company said via a blog post . In its defense , the company says , “ There is no such thing as perfect when it comes to cyber security but we are committed to protecting user data . As soon as the incident was recognized we began a program of security upgrades , ” which is a perhaps a little bit too late .

Facebook looks set to capitalise on the World Cup fever currently sweeping over the globe . It 's reportedly in talks to produce a reality TV show based around the life of superstar footballer Cristiano Ronaldo . Having already worked with the social network on a scripted drama focussing on a female football team in New York , Variety is now reporting that Ronaldo is lining up a $ 10 million dollar deal for a 13-episode behind the scenes look at his life . While Variety 's sources debate how far along the talks have progressed , it 's said that production company Matador and publicists Religion of Sport would team up on the show . Whether producing their own content or simply distributing Hollywood 's finest , the tech giants Google , Apple , Amazon and , of course , Netflix , all do a fine trade with video content . It 's something that Facebook has attempted with middling success . It attempted to court sports fans with live baseball streams , but it was only LaVar Ball 's reality junior basketball show that really found an audience . Could Facebook look at a similar football-themed show for Ronaldo ? One of the most recognisable and gifted sports stars on the planet , he 'd certainly be a bankable star .

Facebook has bought Bloomsbury AI , a British company specializing in natural language processing . The Bloomsbury team will join Facebook 's London office , where they 'll add their skills to the social network 's growing artificial intelligence division . `` The Bloomsbury team has built a leading expertise in machine reading and understanding unstructured documents in natural language in order to answer any question , '' Facebook said in a statement on its Academics page . `` Their expertise will strengthen Facebook ’ s efforts in natural language processing research , and help us further understand natural language and its applications . '' Facebook has a division called Facebook AI Research ( FAIR ) dedicated to the lofty goal of 'solving AI ' – essentially bringing about the Singularity – but its purchase of Bloomsbury is probably more about solving a specific problem . TechCrunch suggests that Facebook bought the company to help identify fake news , but Bloomsbury 's area of expertise – AI that reads text documents and answers based on their contents – suggests that chatbots are more likely to be the reason Mark Zuckerberg opened his wallet . Facebook unveiled chatbots for Messenger in 2016 , as a way for people to communicate more easily with businesses , and by the end of the year 34,000 bots were chatting away with customers . Last year the company released a framework called ParlAI ( parley , get it ? ) to help developers improve their chatbots ' verbal skills , helping make those thousands of bots ' replies faster and less robotic . It also conducted an infamous experiment that involved two chatbots speaking to one another . After a while , their conversations evolved into something that looked nonsensical to human observers but were actually a more efficient evolution of English . `` I can can I I everything else , '' said one bot . `` Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to , '' replied the other . Facebook rebooted the system and started afresh – not because the bots were colluding to take over the world , but because the researchers simply were n't interested in the direction the study had taken . Bloomsbury 's technology could help bots read websites , brochures and other documents , and answer questions based on what they 've learned quickly and , most importantly , in a way that makes sense .

Facebook has just consigned three mobile apps to the trash : Moves , Hello and tbh . If you have n't heard of those three , you 're not alone – Facebook has decided to can them due to lack of use . Moves , which Facebook bought in 2014 , was an activity app for `` fitness tracking without gadgets '' , instead monitoring walking , cycling and running using sensors and GPS data from your phone . Unfortunately for Facebook , people are quite keen on gadgets – particularly wrist-worn fitness trackers , which provide far more data than just speed , distance and estimated calorie burn . You 'll no longer be able to log into Moves after July 30 , but you can export your data to avoid losing your logs . Hello – Caller ID & Blocking was an app for Android users in Brazil , the US and Nigeria . It supplemented your phone 's address book with extra info from Facebook , which it displayed on-screen when you received a call . For example , Hello would alert you if it was that person 's birthday , helping you pretend that you 'd remembered . It was an interesting premise , but Facebook has n't updated the app since 2015 , so it was clearly on borrowed time . The most surprising of the three is tbh , which launched less than a year ago and was acquired by Facebook in October . This wholesome app was designed for teenagers , allowing them to send anonymous compliments to one another . Do n't be downbeat if you were one of these apps ' few fans , though . They might be gone , but Facebook still owns the patents and their legacy could live on through features added to the main Facebook app in the coming months . Via Android Police
Facebook has revealed via a blog post that a bug , active between May 29 and June 5 , had messed with over 800,000 users ’ block list over that one-week period , accidentally unblocking people the affected users had previously blocked . While the social media giant claims that no friendships that were previously ended had been reestablished , the bug did allow posts to be shared with “ a wider audience ” . “ While someone who was unblocked could not see content shared with friends , they could have seen things posted to a wider audience , for example pictures shared with friends of friends , ” explained Facebook ’ s chief privacy officer Erin Egan . Of the affected accounts , 83 % had “ only one person they had blocked temporarily unblocked ” . While that may sound harmless – affecting only a tiny fraction of the 2.4 billion Facebook users – the bug isn ’ t good news for anyone using Facebook ’ s blocking feature to protect themselves from abuse and harassment . “ We know that the ability to block someone is important – and we ’ d like to apologize and explain what happened , ” Egan added . Facebook says the bug has been fixed and has begun informing affected users via a pop-up message . While it ’ s admirable that the company has publicly disclosed the news of the bug , it ’ s another hard hit on the company ’ s already-tarnished public perception . The platform is still reeling from the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal , with accusations of deceiving users into sharing personal information being hurled at it by European consumer groups .

Facebook has revealed to the US Congress that it shared data with 52 hardware and software companies from around the world . As The Wall Street Journal reports , this new information was disclosed in a 747-page document that Facebook provided to the House Energy and Commerce Committee , which has since made the document public . Some of the biggest tech companies on the planet were mentioned as receiving the user data , including Apple , Amazon , Microsoft and Samsung . Nissan , UPS and BlackBerry were also named . As Gizmodo points out , a number of Chinese companies appear in the document , including Alibaba , Huawei , Lenovo and Oppo . This may prove to be rather awkward for Facebook , as US intelligence agencies have taken a keen interest in some of these companies ' alleged ties to the Chinese government . According to Facebook , this data was shared by companies for a number of months after it had stopped developers from using apps to access information belonging to users ’ friends . The data that Facebook shared included names , genders , dates of birth , the city where users lived , hometown , photos and pages liked . Facebook has justified sharing this data by saying that it was done to help users access Facebook and its various features on a number of different platforms , and that the data sharing started at a time when these apps were in their infancy . According to the document , Facebook claims that `` The partnerships – which we call 'integration partnerships ' – began before iOS and Android had become the predominant ways people around the world accessed the internet on their mobile phones . People went online using a wide variety of text-only phones , feature phones , and early smartphones with varying capabilities . '' Facebook then explained that `` In that environment , the demand for internet services like Facebook [ … ] outpaced our industry 's ability to build versions of our services that worked on every phone and operating system . As a solution , internet companies often engaged device manufacturers and other partners to build ways for people to access their experiences on a range of devices and products . '' If you ’ re not totally convinced by that justification , then you ’ re not alone . Congressman Frank Pallone Jr , who sits on the House Energy and Commerce committee , concluded : “ After initial review , I am concerned that Facebook ’ s responses raise more questions than they answer . ”

Facebook and Twitter ’ s fight over whether tweets posted on Twitter can be automatically posted to Facebook has been rumbling on since the beginning of the year , and has now resulted in large numbers of Facebook posts made that way disappearing . It appears that the cause of these posts disappearing is Twitter ’ s recent decision to delete its Facebook platform app . In January , Facebook announced it was removing a feature that allowed cross-posting from Twitter , which made Twitter ’ s Facebook platform app redundant . Read more : Urban VPN Known as “ cross-posting ” , the feature allowed people to post Tweets on Twitter , which would then be automatically posted in Facebook . It meant users with both social media accounts only needed to post an update once , and it seems that Facebook saw this as preventing people from going to its website and posting the update themselves . When Twitter deleted its Facebook app , it apparently did n't realize that this would make previous posts that had been made using the app disappear . However , as TechCrunch reports , a number of people have been complaining about their missing posts . @ facebook I used the Twitter for Facebook app for years , and I realize it 's not working and is n't going to . But I just discovered all the Facebook updates it put have been deleted and dissappeared from my timeline ! Is there a way to retrieve this ? August 26 , 2018 While it ’ s frustrating for many users , this issue also has big ramifications for businesses that relied on being able to post updates to both Twitter and Facebook . Not only have the Facebook posts disappeared – comments on the posts have vanished as well . So , who 's to blame ? TechCrunch reports that a source with an understanding of the problem got in contact to say that Twitter ’ s deletion of the app was a surprise to Facebook , and that Twitter did n't alert the company to the problem immediately . However , the Axios website refers to another source close to Twitter who claims that Twitter had asked Facebook for more time to see if there was a way to make its app continue to work , but Facebook said no . Regardless of who 's at fault , it appears that the deleted content is now back . If you rely on cross posting between Twitter and Facebook , however , you may need to look into other ways to maintain your presence on the feuding social networks .

If you 're bored of your friends and family , how about connecting with a few strangers to spice up your Facebooking ? The social media site is testing a new feature that displays interests you have in common with people you are n't connected to – people who might be commenting on your friends ' posts or pictures , for example . As CNET reports , the idea is that if you share something in common with a person – maybe you 're in the same public Facebook group , or you went to the same college , or you work for the same company – then that shows up alongside that person 's name . Perhaps conscious of the current conversation around user privacy , Facebook is keen to emphasize that only information that 's currently visible on your profile will be used . In other words , other people can only see this type of data if it 's set to be visible by anyone or by friends of friends on your Facebook page . Apparently Facebook wants to prompt conversations that might not otherwise happen if you did n't know someone is from the same community as you , or has the same interest in antique pottery , or whatever else Facebook is digging into . The trial run of the feature is currently limited to a select number of users in the United States . `` Knowing shared things in common helps people connect , '' Facebook told CNET . `` We 're testing adding a 'things in common ' label that will appear above comments from people who you 're not friends with but you might have something in common with . '' It remains to be seen if and when the feature rolls out for everyone , but Facebook is constantly testing out new ideas and tools as it tries to keep user engagement high . A significant number of users are reportedly ditching their Facebook accounts as they look to take their social networking elsewhere or just cut it out all together .

Facebook ’ s user privacy woes don ’ t seem to be letting up . According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal , the Facebook-owned Onavo Protect VPN service app will be removed from the App Store after Apple claimed it violated data collection policies . And it didn ’ t take long for the app to be pulled . While the news broke only about an hour before our writing this story , we can confirm that the security app has already disappeared from the Australian version of the iOS App Store . `` We work hard to protect user privacy and data security throughout the Apple ecosystem , '' an Apple spokesperson said with regards to the decision . `` With the latest update to our guidelines , we made it explicitly clear that apps should not collect information about which other apps are installed on a user 's device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing and must make it clear what user data will be collected and how it will be used . '' Onavo began as an Israeli startup that helped users keep tabs on their mobile data usage , and was acquired by Facebook in 2013 . The Onavo app generally worked like any other VPN service on iOS – by securing data transmitted over the internet with encryption to maintain anonymity – but curiously , there was no explicit mention of improved user privacy or anonymity on the app ’ s Store description . Regardless , Facebook began promoting the app to its users earlier this year , implying that using it would 'protect ' them online . It became one of the social media platform ’ s key tools for keeping tabs on user behaviour outside of its own core apps , and has been accused of being used to help Facebook monitor the competition 's latest products . It ’ s perhaps somewhat surprising that Onavo Protect lasted as long as it did , then , especially after the fracas that was the Cambridge Analytica scandal . The app ’ s own description was rather telling . According to what was published on the App Store , “ Onavo uses a VPN to establish a secure connection to direct all of your network communications through Onavo ’ s servers . As part of this process , Onavo collects your mobile data traffic . ” “ This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analyzing your use of websites , apps and data . Because we 're part of Facebook , we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services , gain insights into the products and services people value , and build better experiences . ” As per the Journal ’ s report , Apple didn ’ t remove the app on its own , but informed Facebook earlier this month that it violated the new App Store guidelines which were implemented in June . Discussions between the two companies took place this week and Apple is reported to have given the social media giant the opportunity to voluntarily pull Onavo Protect from the App Store .

In Facebook ’ s ongoing fight with fake news , it employs a number of methods to help weed out falsehoods from the truth , but now we know the company ’ s method for verifying the verifiers . An article from the Washington Post has revealed that Facebook assigns its users a reputation score between 0 and 1 . When a user flags a post as containing false news , their score is adjusted based on the veracity of this tip . So , for users who consistently flag posts that genuinely contain fake news , their score will rise and Facebook will lend their future tips more weight , whereas the opposite is true of those that continuously report legitimate news . The score has been introduced to combat the growing problem known as ‘ brigading ’ , which sees organized groups of trolls or political activists deliberately flag posts in the hopes to suppress or censor them . Despite the fact that Facebook is now using third-party fact checkers to respond to each of these flags , if they are continuous and made in high quantities , the post can experience reduced visibility , regardless of their legitimacy . Speaking with the Washington Post , Facebook ’ s product manager for fighting fake news , Tessa Lyons , stressed that this score was just one of the methods the company uses to check the reliability of fake news reports and that it was n't the sole indicator of a user 's trustworthiness . At present , this is strictly an internal measure and there is no way for users to check their reputation score , a precaution likely put in place to avoid any further gaming of Facebook ’ s systems to drive personal or political agendas .

Facebook closed teen social app TBH last month – but not before learning some sneaky tactics for targeting high schoolers . In a leaked internal memo obtained by Buzzfeed News , TBH 's founders shared what they called a `` psychological trick '' for attracting young users . `` Our team obsessed with finding ways to get individual high schools to adopt a product simultaneously , '' it said . `` We designed a novel method that was reproducible , albeit non-scalable . '' That method involved Facebook 's own photo-sharing site Instagram . Many teens include the name of their high school on their Instagram profiles – a fact TBH used to its advantage . The company would make a private Instagram account for a targeted school , and invite everyone with the school 's name in their profile to join . It would spark students ' curiosity with a tempting message like `` You 've been invited to the TBH app at [ school name ] – stay tuned ! '' The TBH team would wait 24 hours for students to follow the account back , then add the app store URL to its profile and make it public . It did this at 4pm , just as kids left school for the day – a time it called `` The Golden Launch Hour™ '' . TBH described its methods as `` too 'scrappy ' for a big company '' , but suggested using similar methods . For example , Facebook could request push notification permission , then send messages to targeted users en masse during the Golden Launch Hour . Facebook declined to comment on the memo , and whether it used the tactics described by TBH , but it stands to reason that it would be interested . Market Research indicates that , while more users over 55 are using Facebook , teens are starting to lose interest in favor of apps like Snapchat . Facebook is aware of the problem , and reacted last year by launching Messenger Kids – a version of its chat app designed specifically for pre-teens that only lets them speak to a list of contacts pre-approved by their parents . The idea is that , once they 're 13 , kids will be comfortable enough with the idea to make their own Facebook account . The company is also working with schools to deliver lessons about online safety , which has the handy benefit of raising its profile among youngsters .

Facebook has hit back at criticism it received for allegedly asking banks for financial information on its users . The backlash followed a report which claimed that Facebook had been in contact with several major US banks in order to gain financial data on its users . However the social network has clarified that its aims were in fact more to do with improving the chatbot services ingrained in its Facebook Messenger app . Facebook already works with several financial institutions around the world to allow customers to access information on their account , such as allowing Citibank users in Singapore to bypass customer service calls by using a Messenger chatbot . The app also allows Messenger users to send money to their contacts through a chat window , with payments processed using PayPal . “ The idea is that messaging with a bank can be better than waiting on hold over the phone – and it ’ s completely opt-in , '' Facebook spokesperson Elisabeth Diana told TechCrunch . `` We ’ re not using this information beyond enabling these types of experiences – not for advertising or anything else . A critical part of these partnerships is keeping people ’ s information safe and secure . ” Via : TechCrunch

For those of you waiting to try and find love through your social network , the Facebook dating app is now being tested internally inside the company , according to app researcher Jane Manchun Wong . Facebook has since confirmed a trial run is underway . Screenshots captured by Wong seem to show a sign up screen where you can set your gender and location , as well as specify the sorts of people you 're interested in getting matched up with – all fairly standard for a dating app . Other options in the images seem to let you keep your normal Facebook profile and your dating Facebook profile separate . Right now , some of Facebook 's staff in the US are putting the app through its paces , though it 's mainly to spot bugs and problems rather than set up any office romances , Facebook says . A public launch date still has n't been set . The option to dip into dating will stay within Facebook and not appear as a separate app , the new screenshots would seem to confirm – though as we 've said , those who want to activate the dating option will get a second profile to manage . That should mean you can keep most of your embarrassing Facebook photos away from a potential match , at least until you 've got to know each other a little better . If a mutual attraction is established , you and your virtual date can start messaging each other through WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger . The screens we 've seen suggest Facebook is going for a more mature and serious dating experience than something like Tinder , though really it 's down to the users themselves . The social network 's plans for a dating app were announced back in May .

Facebook and Instagram now have a suite of time-management tools to help you keep tabs on how long you spend uploading , liking and commenting every day . Last month , eagle-eyed Facebook users discovered a reference to an option called 'Your Time on Facebook ' in the social network 's official Android app . The feature has now rolled out in the form of a dashboard that reveals how long you spend using the app each day , and lets you set limits and mute notifications for certain periods . Instagram ( which is owned by Facebook ) has a similar set of tools called 'Your activity ' , which should help you avoid whiling away hours admiring photos of elegantly plated avocados on toast . To access the new tools in the Facebook app , tap the menu icon ( three horizontal lines ) and scroll down to 'Your Time on Facebook ' . In the Instagram app , you can find the 'Your activity ' dashboard in your account settings . Once there , you can see how long you 've spent on the app over the last week , and how much time you spend using it each day on average . You can set a custom daily time allowance , and suspend push notifications so you are n't distracted throughout the rest of your day . The new time-management tools are rolling out to 99 % of users globally over the next couple of weeks . The remaining 1 % will be kept in the dark about their social media usage so Facebook can monitor whether the new dashboards actually cause users to cut back .

There was a time when 'fake news ' wasn ’ t part of the internet lexicon . As Google Trends shows , that changed on November 8 2016 when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States , and it has been part of our collective vocabulary ever since . That correlation is no coincidence . As people tried to come to terms with the biggest upset in modern political history , social media was given a more thorough examination that it had ever had to endure . After a tortuous period of denial , Facebook accepted it had a problem with Fake News and Twitter an issue with trolling – something ironically exacerbated by the new Tweeter-in-Chief , who successfully co-opted the term ‘ fake news ’ as a catch-all for critical reporting , rather than the conspiracy-loaded clickbait his predecessor described as “ a dust cloud of nonsense ” . Both platforms have vowed to clean up their acts . But what if trolling and fake news aren ’ t bugs to be eliminated , but intrinsic features of social media ? That ’ s the contention of Professor Paul Bernal , from the University of East Anglia . “ If we want to address these issues seriously , we have to understand that it 's not that these are bad people misusing the systems , but these are actually inevitable consequences of the way that the systems work , ” he says in a phone interview ahead of the talk . For Twitter this is down to it being , at its heart , a conversational medium – and an open one at that . “ In terms of trolling the problems here are many-sided , ” he explains . “ How do you define what counts as trolling ? If you do it algorithmically , the algorithms make hideous mistakes . The wrong things get banned and the really clever trolls use passive aggressive language , they find clever ways to avoid detection . It 's not in Facebook 's interests for stuff on Facebook to be unemotional . You could say they do n't want boring stuff on their platforms , which sounds good , but actually it means they 're more likely to encourage the bad stuff “ It 's really hard to deal with the nuance , and the trolls find their way round , and they try to encourage things that will get others banned – and it works ! ” For Facebook , it ’ s a little more complicated and is partly down to the way it ’ s evolved . “ Facebook is a place where information is presented to some degree , and that gives an opportunity to present the fake news , ” Bernal says , citing empirical evidence which demonstrates that content is more likely to be shared if its fake and/or threatening . Facebook ’ s emotional contagion experiment showed it could affect mood with the type of news that appeared in feeds . But Bernal feels something important was missing from media analysis : without happy or sad news , engagement plummeted . “ It 's not in Facebook 's interests for stuff on Facebook to be unemotional . You could say they do n't want boring stuff on their platforms , which sounds good , but actually it means they 're more likely to encourage the bad stuff , ” he continues . That ’ s not ideal , but it becomes more alarming when combined with the data collection where Facebook continues to make its money . “ We 've developed systems – and Facebook is the most obvious – which are incredibly efficient at finding out what people are interested in , finding out how you might be able to nudge them in a specific direction , and automatically pushing material to those people , ” Bernal explains . In the wrong hands , these two points – knowing not just which person to target , but the emotional buttons to press – combine to make what Bernal sees as a perfect storm of exploitation . One that ’ s impossible to counter without radically changing human nature or Facebook ’ s financial model . This echoes what technology historian Professor Marie Hicks told me a few months ago when I asked for her thoughts on fixing social media . “ It assumes what we have here is just a bug that needs to be fixed , rather than a poor feature of the system , ” she said after a panel discussion at Nesta ’ s Futurefest . “ If you think that is a fundamentally a business model you want to get – the ad-driven services we have – then you 're left with very few options of how to solve the issues that have become a flashpoint . ” The counter to this , surely , is in our memories : weren ’ t Facebook and Twitter once untainted by these problems ? Bernal concedes that ’ s true , but now the genie is out of the bottle , he says , those days simply can not come back . “ There was a honeymoon period for both – when Facebook really was about linking together families , and Twitter for chatting , ” he responds . “ The underlying problems were there , but they weren ’ t being taken advantage of. ” The increased scale and opportunity for political mischief put paid to that : “ Once the potential was seen , it was inevitable . ” Indeed , the power of fake news and threats have been apparent throughout history , and Bernal will point to Vlad the Impaler in 15th century Romania in his talk . “ They used woodcut pictures cut into pamphlets that were distributed by hand within the community , ” he explains , and these exaggerated caricatures ensured Vlad ’ s reputation preceded him , even for a largely illiterate population . Nowadays , the internet-connected world may be largely literate , but it ’ s not necessarily internet-literate when it comes to judging content . “ You can create a fake news page in seconds , ” Bernal laments , “ so if they shut them down individually they 're onto a losing game of whack-a-mole. ” Likewise , the softer approach of labelling things as fake was abandoned . “ Highlighting things makes people more likely to look at them , and looking at things makes people more likely to believe them , ” Bernal explains . And that ’ s before you even get into the thorny issues of who should be the arbiters of truth : the flawed , biased algorithms or the flawed , biased humans ? Even if Facebook took the age-old advice of avoiding politics and religion in polite discourse , Bernal believes the company would still provide a bridge to fake news peddlers . “ Evidence shows that you can derive the most sensitive information from the most mundane sources , ” he says , highlighting the surprise correlation between curly-fry fandom and intelligence . Ban political ads and “ the clever ones just go one step back ” , working on “ the predictor rather than the politics. ” You can see early work being done in this ‘ one step removed ’ field with the diverse array of political adverts the Vote Leave campaign was shown to have bought on Facebook , targeting everyone from polar bear lovers to football fans . Hicks shares Bernal ’ s pessimism . “ People who thought the internet would be a source of unmitigated good were just ignoring the past , ” she told me when asked if she was optimistic about the internet ’ s future . “ This was a military technology that was specifically designed for certain military ends - and yes you can repurpose it to be a really powerful informational tool , but that is a repurposing . You 're not designing a technology that is somehow intrinsically good . “ If you subscribe to the idea that the internet is a global good , I think we 've hit the high point of that optimism and things are going to slide down from here . ” Imagine a different world where MySpace or Bebo became the dominant force of the social web . Would the fake news problem still exist ? That question , Bernal reckons , has a flawed premise : the eventual winner was always going to be the one that made money from personal data . “ Whoever won was going to be the one that was good at fake news . '' And , as Hicks pointed out , the stakes of that battle were huge , even though nobody knew the fight was going on at the time . Tech companies are “ so powerful and are controlled exclusively by corporations so they become pseudo-governmental , even though they 're completely outside of any process of democratic input , ” she said . Bernal agrees : “ We 've privatized these systems , and done so in such a way that they 're controlled by a relatively small amount of people , ” he says . The open 'marketplace of ideas ' required for the best free speech to flourish is too closed to function , and it ’ s not in the big players ’ interests to reverse that . OK , so what about regulation ? There are pitfalls here . Not only do Facebook and Twitter operate across borders in an era where nations are becoming less cooperative , but that while technology moves fast , law and government moves at a pace that some glaciers would consider plodding . “ By the time you 've sorted out some system to regulate this , everything will have moved on , ” Bernal argues . Hicks , too , wonders if there ’ s any appetite for governmental pressure beyond idle threats . `` In the United States where most of these companies are headquartered , we 're in a very anti-regulatory moment , ” she explained . “ And we 're under an administration that has been really helped by the power of these platforms and probably does n't want to give that up . To what extent should governments be involved in making sure corporations do the right thing ? Would it be even worse if governments emerged as a censor ? Neither option is at all palatable “ I think that the right sort of questions are starting to be asked , but I do n't think we have any of the mechanisms necessary to make those changes right now . ” What about a radical rethink ? The day before I speak to Bernal , leader of the British Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn floats the idea of a nationalised social network : a BeboC , if you will . Although widely lampooned , is it really stranger than a nationalised rail network ? “ Frankly , nationalize Facebook and you kill it , ” Bernal replies . Providing a transparent service that has “ all of the good things with none of the bad ” and “ without the perverse incentives from monetization ” betrays an expectation that what Facebook is now is what it will always be . “ I 'm not on Facebook myself , deliberately for all these reasons , but what makes it attractive , what makes it innovative and what makes it work is very different from providing some kind of national platform for communication , ” he explains . “ It would soon get boring ; it would go the same way as Friends Reunited . ” There ’ s also an element of being careful what you wish for here , and a look over at China shows you where things can go with too much government interference . “ They do n't have to create fake news , ” Bernal points out . “ They can just prevent the real news from appearing . ” “ To what extent should governments be involved in making sure corporations do the right thing ? Would it be even worse if governments emerged as a censor ? Neither option is at all palatable , ” Bernal argues . “ There is n't a simple way out here . ” Even without slipping into authoritarianism , there ’ s every chance governments could make things worse via the law of unintended consequences . “ We do n't really understand what threads that we might pull , what those effects are going to be even five years , 10 years in the future , ” said Hicks . “ The thing with the US elections – it snuck up pretty quickly , and then it was a matter of looking backward and trying to figure out what was going on . ” That ’ s true . In an alternate reality where Hillary Clinton is sitting in the Oval Office , it ’ s hard to imagine scrutiny of Facebook picking up any traction at all . And if you accept that , it ’ s hard to argue that any government action now wouldn ’ t be at least partially motivated by sour grapes . Facebook hasn ’ t responded to my request for comment beyond an initial acknowledgement and Twitter has yet to respond at all , but their public actions to date have been more theatre than practical in Bernal ’ s eyes . “ I suspect with Facebook and Twitter , they 're mostly flying by the seat of their pants , ” he says . “ They 're doing what they need to do to keep their businesses rolling and they 're reacting when they need to react , but would rather do as little as possible and let the systems run by themselves . “ Algorithms are cheaper than humans , ” he says . “ I do n't think they 're as much in control as we think , ” he adds , stating that there ’ s no great conspiracy here . But crucially a lack of malign intent doesn ’ t prevent their actions from having “ massive implications ” . Is there anything positive on the horizon ? Yes , but you have to optimistically squint and claim the glass is 10 % full : “ We are at least in a productive moment of critique , ” Hicks said , pointing to the lively debate going on both inside and outside the industry . She predicts “ significant changes in the next 5-10 years ” . If there ’ s one thing we ’ ve learned in recent years , it ’ s that change isn ’ t always for the better . Does she subscribe to the idea that history repeats itself ? “ I don ’ t think history repeats itself , ” she smiled , “ but it rhymes. ” Wherever you stand politically , that ’ s something to bear in mind when party machines ratchet up their social media spend for the next big campaign .

During its fifth Oculus Connect conference in San Jose , Facebook and Oculus finally pulled the curtain back on its Project Santa Cruz standalone virtual reality ( VR ) headset . It 's known as Oculus Quest and operates completely independently of a PC or smartphone . The headset is currently slated to hit shelves for $ 399 ( about £302 , AU $ 550 ) in the middle of next year – Spring 2019 in North America , according to Facebook . The headset , which does n't require a PC or any tracking cameras , will offer six degrees of freedom ( 6DOF ) tracking and will come with Touch controllers . Oculus Go , the standalone VR headset unveiled at last year 's developer conference , only supports three degrees , or 3DOF . Oculus Quest relies on four ultra-wide sensors located in the headset itself to map your environment and help track the Touch controllers . According to Facebook , over 50 games and experiences for Oculus Quest at launch – including a new Star Wars VR experience – with more coming shortly after that . Oculus Quest uses a technology called Oculus Insight that helps track the headset without the use of room sensors . Insight scans the room using the four ultra-wide sensors and takes a map of the environment . Then , using the sensors inside the headset that include gyroscopes and accelerometers , Oculus Quest can track your movement in a one-to-one way . According to Facebook VR Lead Hugo Barra , Oculus Insight will support a multi-room guardian feature that will keep you in a safe play space within several rooms . This way , you can take the device throughout the house and to friends and family 's houses , which the device remembers over time . Speaking of play spaces , Oculus announced new additions to Oculus Home that will enable more customizable environments and expressive avatars . We 'll be bringing you more news from Oculus Connect 5 , plus our hands-on first impressions of Oculus Quest , so keep checking back here .

Instagram 's founders Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom have resigned , leaving the company they created in the hands of Facebook 's executives . `` We ’ re planning on taking some time off to explore our curiosity and creativity again , '' said Systrom in a blog post . `` Building new things requires that we step back , understand what inspires us and match that with what the world needs ; that ’ s what we plan to do . '' Systrom 's statement suggests an amicable departure , but anonymous sources have told Bloomberg that their decision stemmed from tensions with Facebook 's CEO Mark Zuckerberg , who had become more reliant on Instagram as part of his future plans . Facebook bought Instagram for $ 1 billion ( about £760 million , AU $ 1.4 billion ) in 2012 , two years after it was founded . At the time , Zuckerberg confirmed that Instagram would continue to develop as a standalone service and exist independently , but it seems that was n't enough to keep Krieger and Systrom on board . “ Kevin and Mike are extraordinary product leaders and Instagram reflects their combined creative talents , ” Zuckerberg said in a statement following the pair 's departure . “ I ’ ve learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it . ” Krieger was equally diplomatic , and although he did n't mention Zuckerberg by name , he wished both companies the best . `` We remain excited for the future of Instagram and Facebook in the coming years as we transition from leaders to two users in a billion . We look forward to watching what these innovative and extraordinary companies do next . '' Via The Verge

Originally due to be launched in May , Facebook ’ s flagship video chat device Portal , could be unveiled next week as scandal after scandal forced the social media giant to delay the announcement . The Portal will reportedly function in a similar way to the Amazon Echo Show with more Facebook social features , and will come in two screen sizes - anonymous sources have suggested that the larger size could cost $ 400 ( about £300 , AU $ 550 ) , with the smaller device priced at $ 300 ( about £230 , AU $ 410 ) . Said to use AI-supplied video chat technology , the Portal will reportedly feature Amazon Alexa integration , allowing you to play music , watch videos , and get news updates using voice commands . The Portal is said to feature a wide-angle camera , which uses artificial intelligence to recognizes different users and follow them as they move around the room , meaning you can continue chatting over video while doing chores , or looking for something in your room . Those worried about privacy in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal will be pleased to know that the device ’ s camera will feature a privacy shutter which can be activated when the Portal is not in use . This feature was developed at the last minute in response to reduced public trust in the company as a result of the scandals . Whether these rumors will come to fruition will hopefully be clear by the end of the month , if Facebook really are to release the Portal in the coming weeks . Via Engadget

James Patterson 's latest novel , The Chef , is being released as an 'interactive reading experience ' for Facebook Messenger . The novel will be published in hardcover in February , but Facebook has teamed up with the author to create a preview that will let readers engage with the story and characters via video and sound clips . To try it , search for 'The Chef Book Test Page ' in the Messenger app . Patterson , the high-profile writer behind the Alex Cross series , is also hosting a live Q & A session , which you can join on the book 's Facebook group , and has created Instagram profiles for its key characters . Bestselling American author Patterson is no stranger to digital releases in some form or another , having earned a Guinness World Record for being the first person to sell over a million ebooks . He also has a track record for finding new ways to share stories in an age of digital formats and shortened attention spans . In 2016 , he launched a series of bite-sized novels for the platform BookShots . Each title is under 150 pages long , and costs under $ 5 ( about £4 , AU $ 7 ) . `` You can race through these – they 're like reading movies , '' he says . Via The Verge

Rarely out of the spotlight these days , Facebook ’ s most recent scandal saw information on 30 million users stolen at the hands of hackers . With public opinion of Facebook continuing to flux , we took the opportunity to poll businesses at the IP Expo earlier this month on the state of their cyber defences in the wake of this latest high profile attack . When we last spoke to the tech industry , at Cloud Expo earlier this year , it was on the heels of the news that millions of Facebook profiles had been exploited for political purposes . Back then , trust in Facebook was understandably shaken , with more than 50 % stating that they trusted the social media juggernaut less following its involvement with Cambridge Analytica . Our recent findings at IP Expo echoed this , with 41 % going as far to say that they didn ’ t trust Facebook even before this latest story . This is all having a positive impact on individual security awareness , however , with 28 % claiming to have amended their security settings since these breaking stories . It ’ s encouraging , then , to see users become increasingly wary of how they use Facebook in their personal lives , but what effect has this had on businesses ? For all that we ’ re still unsure of following the recent Facebook hack , we do know that information on at least 30 million accounts was stolen ( versus the originally reported 50 million ) , and that the attackers had total access to a trove of personal information including usernames , email addresses and phone numbers . For over 14 million of the accounts , however , the hackers also acquired information on relationship statuses , work and education history , religious beliefs , current city , gender , device type , recent check ins and much more . With information on workplaces included in the stolen information , it would be foolish to argue that many organisations will now find themselves in the phishing firing line - a sentiment shared among those we spoke to at IP Expo . More than a third agreed that the hack meant that businesses were likely to become phishing targets , with just 20 % of respondents believing it could instead alert businesses to predict such an attack and ( hopefully ) prepare themselves . That being said , businesses are clearly taking stock : one in four of the 200 businesses we polled believed they had both the technology and education needed to combat any potential phishing scams . 38 % , meanwhile , were confident they had the technology in place but not the user education , while on the flip side 22 % believed they were properly educated but didn ’ t have adequate technology in place . Encouragingly , only 7 % had reason to panic , with neither the technology or education in place to protect them . So what does the future hold for Facebook , in both our consumer and business lives ? Those who regularly use the social media platform but haven ’ t reviewed their security and sharing settings should do so immediately , particularly if , like many of us , they have other apps linked to their account that could be at risk of being compromised . On the business front , user education and raised awareness of criminal techniques is critical in defending against potential attacks . Those regularly implementing simulation and training programs will see improved security awareness among their users , utilising simulations to empower individuals with the baseline knowledge and confidence to identify subtle phishing attempts . Of course human resilience can only go so far . Technology in the form of effective perimeter filtering , bespoke network architecture and other tools to identify malware within the network are also vital for a robust security strategy . Businesses would also be wise not to become complacent , ensuring they remain up to date with the latest software and security updates and developments in order to maintain a sophisticated security strategy . If the likes of Facebook and Google find themselves victims to cyber-attacks , any one of us could be next . Every breach , every news story and every attack proves that we need to become the gatekeepers of our most valued data . Asaf Cidon , VP of Email Security at Barracuda Networks

Social media remains a popular internet application , and is a powerful platform for connecting with family and friends , as well as finding like minded individuals across many topics . Dating back over a decade to 2004 , Facebook remains the leader in social media , with 2.23 billion users worldwide , and is also the most popular social media app in the US with over 168 million users . With over two billion folks looking to make online connections , Facebook remains quite popular , which contributes to additional users joining up . However , before you pull up your smartphone and breeze through those app sharing permissions , clicking ‘ Yes ’ to give access to every sensor and bit of data that the device has , just to get the app working , let ’ s look at the data collected on Facebook users , so you can make an informed decision if this is the platform for you . While Facebook is not quite upfront with their data collection , and it is more opaque as they emphasize other aspects , it is not a secret either . You can certainly head to Facebook ’ s page , that they title “ What categories of my Facebook data are available to me ? ” where they list many categories of what they collect and keep . Here are some of the highlights : This one should hardly be a shocker , as there are occasions where folks purchase items on Facebook . These purchases include games , ticketed events and contributions for both personal and charitable fundraisers . As this is done via a credit card , Facebook has this on file , which seems appropriate enough , but in reality should give any user a pause for concern with the revelation of a recent hack of Facebook that exposed information on 30 million users . Furthermore , Facebook keeps a running tally on these purchases , and for those that buy stuff , can easily track where the money gets spent , and use this to build a personal profile on you from the causes you support . Facebook continues to be popular on smartphones , and in fact for last year , 63 % of Facebook users went with the mobile platform , making it quite a bit more popular than desktop use , a trend that is expected to continue in coming years . While the Facebook app needs to be on the smartphone for use , this is another example of a ‘ Grabby app , ’ as just because it gets downloaded to a phone , it should not just helping itself to an unsuspecting user ’ s data . On balance , most of us would likely be ok with Facebook going through our contacts , for the purpose of finding us some additional folks to friend and expand our Facebook circle . However , most users would not realize that their Facebook app has been delving into more than that . In particular , on the Android platform , there have been reports of Facebook having access to , and keeping data on the calling history of the user- yes that includes every single call for a time period spanning years . If that is not enough , the Facebook app also has helped itself to the SMS data , you know , all those texts sent back and forth constantly . They are also applying their algorithm to try and determine business from personal contacts . If you wanted Facebook to have your message , you could have sent a Facebook Messenger , and not a text . Also fascinating , is that the phone contacts , call history and SMS data does not get mentioned , at all , in their list of the types of data they collect . Following the Google model of making money through targeted advertising , in a recent analysis , Facebook is deriving 98 % of their income from an advertising business model . And targeted advertising achieves better results the more that they know about their audience . Therefore , Facebook keeps a running tally of your likes and dislikes , based on your past activity . Therefore , if you like a certain political figure , for example , while Facebook claims they won ’ t sell this information directly , they will then allow advertisers to send ads based on what they surmise your political preferences are . As ad revenue is so crucial to the company , they also incorporate your other data , including demographics such as age , gender and topics liked to try and find you relevant ads , which they term your ‘ Ad preferences . ’ They also target ads based on your previous clicks on ads , as well as your posts , and which posts of others you have liked . After all , rather than just showing random ads , it is much better to send the right ad to an interested party , such as an ad to for a baby registry once Facebook knows that the user is pregnant , or car ads once they know that you put up a post that you were stranded by the side of the road waiting for a tow truck . Part of settling into your Facebook account is to post a profile pic , allowing you to be easily recognized by other users . It also , for those with common names like “ John Smith , ” makes it easier for other users to confirm they are friending the correct John Smith that they attended college with , and not the other umpteen others that they could be confused with . Facebook has taken this further , ran Artificial Intelligence facial recognition software on user ’ s profile pics , and turned them into a large database . This came up as users figured out that they were being automatically tagged in other user ’ s images , while nobody had manually designated who they were . Earlier this year , this even resulted in a class action lawsuit going ahead . Users have claimed that they did not explicitly consent to being subjected to the facial recognition process , nor the creation and storage of their facial templates . Once again , Facebook ’ s own page on their too long list of data collected on users , neglects to mention anything about storing your facial recognition template . While many of us can not remember what we had for breakfast today , Facebook remembers- like everything . They know exactly when you created your account , everyone you friended and unfriended , and every post you have ever made . They know your work , your college and have a front row seat on your relationship status . If that was not creepy enough , under the term Facebook Location Services , they know exactly where you are currently , and everywhere you go . Sure , there is a way to opt out , but too many users , most likely by default , opt in , and literally have ‘ Big Brother Facebook ’ along for the ride , and tracking their every move .

Facebook has been hit with a £500,000 fine by the Information Commissioner ’ s Office ( ICO ) for failing to protect the data of its users during the Cambridge Analytica scandal . The fine is the maximum possible punishment the ICO is allowed to deliver , as it slammed Facebook for what it called “ serious breaches of data protection law ” . The ICO also says that after the breaches were discovered , Facebook failed to do another to follow up and regulate bodies such as Cambridge Analytica for improperly using user data . “ Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before , during and after the unlawful processing of this data , ” said Elizabeth Denham , Information Commissioner . “ A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better . ” The fine follows a Notice of Intent served by the ICO back in July that it would be investigating Facebook as part of a wide-ranging probe into the use of data analytics for political purposes . As the alleged infringement took place between 2007 and 2014 , it does not fall under GDPR , which could have seen Facebook ’ s fine be significantly more . “ We considered these contraventions to be so serious we imposed the maximum penalty under the previous legislation , ” Denham added . “ The fine would inevitably have been significantly higher under the GDPR . One of our main motivations for taking enforcement action is to drive meaningful change in how organisations handle people ’ s personal data . ” “ Our work is continuing . There are still bigger questions to be asked and broader conversations to be had about how technology and democracy interact and whether the legal , ethical and regulatory frameworks we have in place are adequate to protect the principles on which our society is based . ”
Facebook has launched a bundle of new tools to make your social media experience more musical . The first , Lip Sync Live , began rolling out in June , but is now available to everyone . As the name suggests , this is a kind of mute karaoke that lets you mime along to songs that play in the background . Facebook has secured rights for songs from artists including Maroon 5 and Khalid , and more tracks from various labels will be arriving over the coming months . You 'll see the option when you start a live video . Viewers will be able to see the name of the artist , and tap through to see their page and follow them . Another new feature is the ability to also add soundtracks to photos and videos in your Facebook News Feed or Stories . Shoot or upload a picture or clip , then select the music sticker to add a track . If that 's not enough , your profile will soon have a new music section too , where you can pin songs to share them with friends . Tapping a song on a profile will play a brief clip , and display a selection of photos and videos from the artist . They can then add the song to their own profile , or visit the artist 's page . Facebook has been courting the music industry for a while ( optional backing tracks for photos arrived on Instagram earlier this year ) , and it seems the work is starting to pay off . We 'll be keeping an eye out for more collaborations with artists and labels in the coming months . Via Forbes

Following in the footsteps of Spotify , which recently slimmed down its Premium app , Facebook Messenger has begun rolling out a more streamlined version of its mobile app for both iOS and Android . Announced in a blog post , “ Messenger 4 ” vastly simplifies the user interface of the app , reducing the number of tabs from nine to just three . In doing so , Messenger retains all the previous functionality it once had ( whether you like it or not ) , but organises it in a less overwhelming manner . The Chats tab now contains both one-to-one and group conversations , as well as a smaller camera icon for you to take photos or video for sharing . The People tab allows you to see who ’ s currently online and watch your friends ’ Stories . The third tab , Discover , neatly rounds up all the Messenger functions you ’ ve been likely avoiding thus far , such as connecting with brands and businesses , playing Instant Games , news , and so on . Another groovy feature added in the update , also in the aesthetic and cosmetic realm , is the ability to add color gradients to your chat messages and , according to the announcement post , we ’ ll be seeing the introduction of Dark Mode “ in the near future ” . The changes have been brought about in response to a survey conducted by Facebook , which found 71 % of respondents state that simplicity was their top priority in a messaging app . Messenger 4 is rolling out to all users over the next few days , and further updates are expected in the near future . If , however , you ’ re looking to use the service as it was intended ( to chat ) and still find the interface overwhelming , we recommend trying out Messenger Lite .

After massive security breaches many companies would be licking their wounds . however Facebook is reportedly looking to beef up its online protection by acquiring a major vendor in the space . Reports have suggested the social media giant is on the hunt for a suitable partner , and has already been in talks with several large companies , with a deal potentially due to be wrapped up before the end of the year . A security move for Facebook is no surprise given the Cambridge Analytica scandal earlier this year ( which brought Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg under congressional scrutiny earlier this year ) , and the hack of 30million users ’ data in September . It isn ’ t currently known which major cyber-security firm Facebook is looking to acquire , however it is likely one that would offer analytics , suspicious-behaviour monitoring and offer account-risk assessment systems . In addition to the company ’ s security protocols and software , Facebook would also acquire the high-profile talented included in that company ’ s employment roster—which would be a major coup for their talent pool . The acquisition of an internet securities company will not only help them plug potential data breach holes but also prevent Zuckerberg from further political debacles . Via : The Information

In a confusing world of fake news and catfishing that it helped create , Facebook apparently wants to get real with a reboot of MTV ’ s The Real World for its Facebook Watch video platform . The social network and TV giant have teamed up for three new seasons of the show set to debut in mid 2019 . The three new seasons will be filmed in Mexico , Thailand and the US respectively , and will incorporate interactive elements via Facebook ’ s platform that will `` empower fans to shape the action '' according to a press release from the two companies . Each season of the show will allow viewers to vote one housemate into the cast before filming begins , and fans will get to connect with cast members through Facebook Live , Premieres ( recorded videos aired via Facebook Live ) and Watch Party ( in which Facebook Groups watch videos together with miniature chat rooms ) . Facebook and MTV are aiming to live up to the original show ’ s tagline and mission statement : “ The true story of seven strangers , picked to live in a house , work together and have their lives taped , to find out what happens when people stop being polite ... and start getting real . ” That might be a tall order these days , with both Facebook and reality television under strong scrutiny as to their ‘ realness ’ . But , hey , at least it might be entertaining to see complete strangers clash in a gorgeous house all over again . Via CNET
When Facebook launched its long-awaited video chat devices Portal and Portal+ last week , many were understandably concerned about its implications for data protection and privacy . After the widely covered Cambridge Analytica scandal and recent Facebook data breach , inviting the social media giant into the home seemed like a step too far for some consumers . In anticipation of this , Facebook originally assured consumers that it `` wont listen to , view , or keep the contents of your Portal calls '' , but now a spokesperson for the social media giant has backtracked on those claims , telling Recode that the Portal is in fact capable of collecting your data : `` Portal voice calling is built on the Messenger infrastructure , so when you make a video call on Portal , we collect the same types of information ( i.e . usage data such as length of calls , frequency of calls ) that we collect on other Messenger-enabled devices. `` Not only that , but Facebook has also admitted that this data could be used for ad targeting , saying : `` We may use this information to inform the ads we show you across our platforms . Other general usage data , such as aggregate usage of apps , etc. , may also feed into the information that we use to serve ads . '' Ads are obviously where Facebook makes its money , though it 's not clear whether Facebook 's original claim – that it would not collect data from Portal users – was a simple mistake by its communications team , or something less innocent . This news comes just one week after a huge data breach that compromised the security of 30 million Facebook users , and public trust in the social network has been in steady decline , even if user numbers have n't followed the same trend . The new video chat devices are currently available only in the US for pre-order , though how much the Portal takes off may largely depend on how much more personal data users are willing to entrust .

Ever had that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach when you 've sent a Facebook message you really should n't have ? Or you 've sent the right message , but to the wrong person ? Facebook wants to cover your back – it 's testing a new feature to that gives you a small window for unsending messages . First spotted by seasoned tipster Jane Wong , you 'll be able to long-press on a message to unsend it , though there will be a limit on how many messages you can retract , apparently . These and other details are still being ironed out , we assume . Facebook has n't said anything officially about the news , so it 's not clear if or when the functionality is going to make it around to everyone else . It 's something Facebook has previously promised to do , though , and you can already unsend messages in WhatsApp , so it seems like the feature will reach everyone eventually . Of course this is something you 've been able to do for a while in the likes of Gmail , so Facebook is playing catch up as far as unsending messages goes . It 's also reeling from the September hack that left data on up to 30 million users exposed , with details still emerging on how information leaked out . It 's actually not been a great year for Facebook and data security at all . The ramifications of the Cambridge Analytica scandal continue to rumble on , with WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton the latest to encourage users to ditch Facebook for good . Perhaps being able to unsend messages is going to be enough to tempt a few users to keep their Facebook accounts active for a little longer yet – either that or it could port all of its messaging services over to Instagram and we can all leave Facebook behind for good in favor of a different Facebook-owned platform .

Update : Facebook has just announced additional details on last month 's data breach . The company now says that only 30 million accounts had their access tokens stolen instead of the 50 million they had originally believed , and of those 30 million , 15 million users just had their emails and phone numbers taken . Worse , however , is that for 14 million unlucky users , the hackers were able to access both email info and phone numbers plus their `` username , gender , locale/language , relationship status , religion , hometown , self-reported current city , birthdate , device types used to access Facebook , education , work , the last 10 places they checked into or were tagged in , website , people or Pages they follow , and the 15 most recent searches '' as well . Read more : 000webhost Thankfully , 1 million users of the targeted attack had no data stolen at all . In an updated post on Facebook 's newsroom , the company says it 's working with the FBI , who is actively investigating the situation , and therefore ca n't reveal who they believe were behind the attack . Original story follows below ... Earlier this week Facebook discovered a breach in its security that compromised the data of nearly 50 million accounts . The announcement that the breach occurred was made on Friday and while authorities have been contacted , but Facebook has yet to discover where the attack came from or the full scope of it . The breach was discovered by Facebook ’ s engineering team Tuesday morning and , according to a post on Facebook ’ s newsroom , the company says that 90 million users were forced to log out and log back in to verify their credentials . According to Facebook , the attackers used the “ View As ” feature that allows users to see what their account looks like to their friends , family members and complete strangers to “ steal Facebook access tokens which they could then use to take over people ’ s accounts ” . After the breach , Facebook says it will disable that feature until it can conduct a thorough security review . At the moment , Facebook has yet to reveal what data was affected by the breach but says that it ’ s working to figure that information out . It doesn ’ t help that the company isn ’ t sure who the attackers are or where the attackers came from . Those details , according to Facebook , are still under investigation . “ We ’ re working hard to better understand these details — and we will update this post when we have more information , or if the facts change . In addition , if we find more affected accounts , we will immediately reset their access tokens . ” Facebook has reset the access tokens for some 50 million accounts it knows were affected by the breach , alongside another 40 million other accounts that may have been affected . For those worried they may be affected , Facebook is encouraging folks to visit the “ Security and Login ” section in their settings to log out of all the locations signed in with their account .
If you were an Internet user in the late '90s to early '00s , there 's a good chance that you spent your evenings logged in to chat rooms or services like IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) , talking to hundreds of strangers about ... well , anything at all . You may long for those heady days of chatting with strangers for hours on end , and if you do , you 'll be pleased know that Facebook is now rolling out large-scale group chats for Facebook Groups , with up to 250 people able to talk at one time . This means that you 'll no longer have to rely on posting in the group itself to start conversations with other members , instead you 'll be able to chat in real-time . Not only that , if you 're a member of a Facebook Group , you 'll also have the ability to video chat with up to 50 members at once , making it even easier to build relationships with people who share similar interests . Although these updates to Facebook Groups are n't available for everyone just yet , they should roll out over the next few weeks - so get ready for a lot of notifications . If you 're already exhausted by the thought of you 're phone constantly vibrating , fear not - you 'll be able to disable notifications for these chats , as well as opting to only be notified if someone tags you directly in a message with the ' @ ' symbol . Furthermore , Group admins will have another layer of control for these large-scale chats , with the ability to terminate spammy chats and the option to only allow admins to create them .

Facebook has just announced that its long-awaited video chat devices Portal and Portal+ are now available to preorder in the US , with shipping due to commence in November . With a 10-inch 1280 x 800 display , the Portal is part of Facebook 's mission to improve video calling by making it `` completely hands and distraction free '' . If you 're looking for a larger screen , the Portal+ is 15 inches wide , with both devices acting as a digital photo frame , displaying images from your Facebook feed when they are not being used to make calls . Designed to rival the Amazon Echo Show , the Portal will retail for $ 199 ( around £150 / AU $ 280 ) , whereas the larger model , the Portal+ , will cost $ 349 ( £270 / AU $ 495 ) , with Facebook 's current deal of $ 100 off any two devices meaning you can get both for $ 298 if you 're a US customer . It 's not year clear when Facebook will be launching the devices in markets outside the US , or how much they 'll cost , but we 've reached out to Facebook and we 'll update this story as soon as we know more . The new video call devices are powered by AI , with Facebook 's 'Smart Camera ' technology designed to follow you as you move around the room and zoom in to the action , meaning you can continue chatting over video while doing chores , cooking in the kitchen , or looking for something in your room . Portal 's Smart Camera works in tandem with 'Smart Sound ' , which minimizes background noise and hones in on the person speaking for a clearer video call experience . Your friends do n't need to own a Portal to receive your calls ; as long as they have Facebook Messenger on their smartphone or tablet , you 're good to go , with up to seven different people on one call . In order to make the Portal hands-free , Facebook has enabled voice controls – all you have to do is say 'Hey Portal ' followed by the name of who you would like to call to start a video chat . For more robust voice-activated assistance , Portal also has Amazon Alexa built in , so you can ask your new video calling device for weather updates , news , and more , just like the Amazon Echo . Facebook seems to be well aware that privacy is a major concern for consumers in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal , so it 's made it easy to turn off the camera and microphone with a single tap , set up a password to lock the Portal 's screen , and has also included a camera cover so you can physically block the lens at any time without missing out on notifications . The social media giant claims that it wo n't `` listen to , view , or keep the contents of your Portal calls '' , and that all calls are encrypted for heightened security . You 'll also be able to delete your Portal or Portal+ device 's voice history using your Facebook Activity log . One cool feature of the new Portal devices is that they enable shared activities ; so , for example , you can listen to music or watch TV shows with the person you 're calling , with Facebook teaming up with Spotify , Pandora , Food Network , and more . Facebook has also said that it 's incorporating AR effects into the new video calling devices , with 'Story Time ' designed to bring bedtime stories to life with colorful visuals and custom sound effects . This uses the Portal 's Smart camera feature to transform your face and voice into those of the story 's characters , meaning you can still give your kids ( or your pets ) un-rivaled bedtime tales no matter how far away you are .

Facebook has launched an appeal against the £500,000 fine it was given following the Cambridge Analytica scandal . The social network says that the penalty handed out by the ICO last month was unfair , as there was `` no evidence '' that user information was shared inappropriately . Facebook says that because the watchdog found no evidence that the personal data of UK users was shared without their knowledge , the fine ( the maximum value allowed by law ) was unjustified . Around a million Facebook users in the UK are thought to have had their account information unlawfully accessed by agents working for Cambridge Analytica . User information was directly harvested using a free personality quiz on the site , with the public data of their contacts also recorded . The ICO has noted that Facebook could have faced a much higher fine that £500,000 if the case had taken place under GDPR , which only came into force following the supposed data collection . `` Their reasoning challenges some of the basic principles of how people should be allowed to share information online , with implications which go far beyond just Facebook , which is why we have chosen to appeal , '' a statement from Facebook 's lawyer Anna Benckert said . `` For example , under the ICO 's theory people should not be allowed to forward an email or message without having agreement from each person on the original thread . `` These are things done by millions of people every day on services across the internet , which is why we believe the ICO 's decision raises important questions of principle for everyone online which should be considered by an impartial court based on all the relevant evidence . '' The ICO has confirmed it has received Facebook 's appeal , which will now be considered by the independent General Regulatory Chamber tribunal . If Facebook is unhappy with the outcome of the tribunal , it can take its case to the UK Court of Appeal .

Facebook is using AI-powered 'proactive detection ' to identify drug-related images before they 're seen or reported by users . It hopes that this will make the site less useful to dealers . `` Our technology is able to detect content that includes images of drugs and depicts the intent to sell with information such as price , phone numbers or usernames for other social media accounts , '' explained Kevin Martin , head of US public policy at Facebook . Martin says that using AI to find these images means human moderators have more time for trickier tasks like identifying trends in drug sales , and finding pages , groups and hashtags related to drug use . Facebook has also joined Twitter and Google to form a coalition called Tech Together to Fight the Opioid Crisis , which aims to share the best ways to fight opioid addiction . Representatives from the three companies will meet in Washington DC to speak with experts and specialist organizations working in the fields of addiction prevention , treatment and recovery . It 's estimated that over two million people in the US are dependent on opioids ( both legally prescribed and illegal ) , and over 49,000 US citizens died as a result of overdosing on the drugs last year . `` Facebook services allow friends , families and support networks to help one another through challenging times , making it easier for people who are struggling with addiction or helping loved ones in this battle get the resources they need , '' said Martin . `` We look forward to our new industry alliance and finding ways to increase our impact through collaboration and supporting the important work of our partners .

By most accounts Facebook is n't much of a hit with youngsters these days – it 's just not cool enough , and is crawling with parents and grandparents – so enter Lasso , a new video and music sharing app that Facebook hopes will win some of its lost teens back . Coincidentally , Lasso is n't hugely different from TikTok , one of the up and coming apps currently proving popular with the younger generation . Both focus on sharing short video clips and popular music tracks with small groups of friends , and both come packed with a bunch of camera and filter effects to play around with . `` Lasso makes it easy for anyone to create and share short videos with fun filters and effects , '' says the app description . `` Follow creators , search hashtags , discover popular viral video trends and join in by putting your own spin on them . '' Of course Facebook has a long history of launching new apps to try and ride the wave of whatever is proving a hit with the kids at the time – Lifestage , anyone ? Facebook Rooms ? Most of these spin-offs end up being largely ignored by the majority of users . When that does n't work , Facebook simply buys up the competition , as it did with TBH , an anonymous commenting app that was gaining traction with teens before Facebook picked it up and promptly shut it down . Going further back in time , there are the big money acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram too . We 'll wait and see if Lasso fares any better than Facebook 's previous attempts to recapture some of its mojo . The free app has n't been officially announced by Facebook yet , and is only available to download for Android and iOS in the US for the time being . Via Engadget

Facebook has announced that it has started shipping its flagship smart displays , the Portal and the larger Portal+ to customers in the US . The devices are priced at $ 199 ( around £150 / AU $ 280 ) and $ 349 ( £270 / AU $ 495 ) respectively , and the social media giant is also running a deal that gets you $ 100 off any two devices . It still has n't announced when the video-calling devices will be rolled out to other territories , including the UK and Australia . The new devices are part of Facebook 's mission to improve video calling by making it `` completely hands and distraction free '' , and use AI technology in tandem with a 'Smart Camera ' to follow you around the room as you chat , zooming in on wherever the action is . The company has also released a blog post that further clarifies its privacy policy – concerns were raised about security and data protection after initial claims by Facebook that the Portals would n't `` listen to , view , or keep the contents of your Portal calls '' were retracted last month . Facebook has since promised that it will treat all Portal calls in the same way it treats Messenger conversations – so while it wo n't view the calls , it will collect data usage , which could in turn be used to generate cross-party ads . Although this may sound alarming , Facebook says it wo n't be using the contents of your calls to generate adverts – so if you mention that you 're buying a new outfit in a Portal video call , you wo n't then see adverts for clothes shops on your Facebook feed as a direct result . Instead , the type of data Facebook is collecting is mainly concerned with the frequency and duration of calls – how this will affect the ads you see while using the social media site is n't clear . Facebook also claims that all calls are encrypted , and any of the AI tech is `` performed locally on the device '' , meaning this kind of data wo n't be sent to its servers . So , if we 're to believe what Facebook says , you do n't have to worry about personally-identifying data being captured , but things like your video call length and frequency will be tracked – and if you 're already part of the wider Facebook network , chances are you 're already okay with that . If not , you might want to consider whether bringing Facebook into your kitchen or living room through the new Portal devices is right for you . Via TechCrunch

WhatsApp lets you do it – if you ’ ve sent a message by mistake , you ’ ve got a window of time within which you can delete it . Even Gmail gives users a few seconds to 'undo send ' . Facebook is finally following suit and adding the feature to its Messenger app . The announcement was discovered by Twitter user @ MattNavarra as “ coming soon ” in the release notes of Messenger ’ s 191.0 version on iOS . INTERESTING ... Facebook Messenger ‘ s long-awaited delete messages feature will only give you a 10 minute window to remove a message in a chat pic.twitter.com/ew1z2WPXbcNovember 7 , 2018 While Facebook-owned WhatsApp gives you an hour to delete sent messages , Messenger isn ’ t going to be so magnanimous . You ’ ll only have 10 minutes to redact that silly photo or drunken confession you just sent to the wrong person . Facebook began floating the idea of allowing sent messages to be deleted in April after the company was caught red-handed retracting messages sent by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other execs . While the 10-minute window is rather unforgiving , the new feature will nonetheless be a welcome addition , although no specific time frame for the rollout has been announced . [ Via The Verge ]

Private Facebook conversations of some 81,000 users were posted after hackers used third-party browser extensions to monitor communication between users , according to a new report . So far only 81,000 users had their conversations leaked online but , according to the group that obtained all the data , over 120 million accounts could be affected . While this might sound reminiscent of the recent Facebook hack that compromised the personal data of some 30 million users that also happened last month , this attack is different than – and completely unrelated to – that previous attack . How it differs is that Facebook security itself hasn ’ t been compromised - according to the BBC ’ s investigative team , hackers were using browser extensions to collect the data . These hackers were also only able to obtain Facebook conversations - snippets of text sent between users - rather than users ’ personal information that ’ s stored on Facebook servers . The other key difference between the two hacks are the targets : the personal information that was stolen seemed primarily to focus on American accounts while the more recent browser hack targeted users living in Ukraine and Russia . Some conversations are from the UK , US , Brazil and elsewhere , but these countries ’ users weren ’ t the primary targets . Once hackers obtained conversations , they proceeded to sell them online for 10 cents ( 8 British pence ) per account – a small sum that multiplied by 81,000 could 've been a lucrative haul for the hackers were they not shutdown by local police . To verify the information contained in the conversations were real , the BBC Russian Service in collaboration with a cyber-security company Digital Shadows contacted the victims who all confirmed that those conversations really happened . When asked about a possible connection to the Russian state or Kremlin-run programs like the Internet Research Agency , a representative for the hacking group only identified as John Smith said there was no connection . In response to the story , Facebook executive Guy Rosen told the BBC that the company has `` Contacted browser-makers to ensure that known malicious extensions are no longer available to download in their stores , '' and `` Have also contacted law enforcement and have worked with local authorities to remove the website that displayed information from Facebook accounts . '' While this , in no way , is Facebook 's fault and falls more on browser developers like Safari , Firefox and Chrome who did n't properly vet some of these extensions , it 's not good optics for a company still in the hot seat after the Cambridge Analytica scandal .

Following Facebook 's disclosure of its recent security breach which impacted millions of its users , the head of its enterprise business offering , Julien Codorniou personally reached out to one of its biggest clients to inform them that their data had not been exposed . The client was Walmart and the company is just one of the many businesses that have signed up for Workplace by Facebook which allows employees to interact with one another using the same tools they are familiar with from the social network . According to Facebook , the service is currently used by 30,000 organisations including Starbucks and Chevron . After the social network 's recent security breach was disclosed , Codorniou worked quickly to personally inform Workplace 's customers that steps were being taken to further separate the enterprise-focused service from its consumer offering . Facebook is planning to give Workplace its own domain separate from the main site to boost its branding and build customer trust . The new domain , Workplace.com , is currently live as a marketing site for the service though it is expected to become Workplace by Facebook 's landing page at some point in 2019 . Customers had previously expressed concerns over the fact that the enterprise tool is hosted on the same domain as Facebook 's consumer business and the move will likely appease these concerns . Product manager for Workplace by Facebook , Luke Taylor explained the decision to separate the businesses to CNBC , saying : “ We have been in a position where even though we are separate from them , it ’ s a bit difficult to have that story when we are hosted on the Facebook.com domain . This is something that we want to do from a brand point of view but also something that I think gives our customers more trust in the product itself . “ When you look at the Oculuses , Instagrams and even the Facebooks of the world , they all have their own domains and their own brand identity . As we ’ ve seen our growth increase so rapidly and our traction in the market increase , we just felt it was exactly the right time to step forward with our own brand . ” Via CNBC

Facebook is reportedly working on its own digital currency , despite banning ads for cryptocurrency earlier this year , according to Bloomberg . Citing Facebook insiders as its source , Bloomberg has said the company is developing a type of 'stablecoin ' , which is a digital currency tied to the US dollar – and in theory , it 's more stable than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a result . According to the article , the new currency will allow users to transfer money via its mobile messaging service WhatsApp . A company spokesperson told Bloomberg , `` like many other companies , Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology . '' They went on to say that , `` this new small team is exploring many different applications . We don ’ t have anything further to share . '' Although Facebook has so far been unwilling to shed much light on its plans to develop a digital currency , Bloomberg has suggested that it would likely launch in India first – after all , India is a world-leader in remittance , with people sending a huge $ 69 billion home in 2017 . Whether people will be accepting of a Facebook-led digital currency is uncertain , particularly as public trust in the company has dipped yet again as a result of a new data privacy scandal emerging earlier this week .

Following the news that Facebook has been embroiled in yet another privacy scandal , the company has released a blog post entitled 'Let ’ s Clear Up a Few Things About Facebook ’ s Partners ' . An investigation by the New York Times revealed Netflix , Spotify , and the Royal Bank of Canada as companies that Facebook granted access to its users ' private messages , while other companies like Amazon , Sony , and Microsoft , were given access to information on users ' Facebook friends . In its statement , Facebook admitted that it gave third-parties access to private messages , saying : `` To be clear : none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people ’ s permission , nor did they violate our 2012 settlement with the FTC . '' The post went on to explain that `` our integration partners had to get authorization from people . You would have had to sign in with your Facebook account to use the integration offered by Apple , Amazon or another integration partner '' . While Netflix , along with Spotify and the Royal Bank of Canada , claims it did n't know the true extent of the personal data it had access to , CNBC has reported the companies `` were able to read , write and delete users ' private messages '' . In response , Netflix has released a statement saying : `` Over the years we have tried various ways to make Netflix more social . '' `` One example of this was a feature we launched in 2014 that enabled members to recommend TV shows and movies to their Facebook friends via Messenger or Netflix . It was never that popular so we shut the feature down in 2015 . At no time did we access people ’ s private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so . ” It 's not the first time this year that Facebook has been indicted in a security scandal – in fact , it 's been a terrible year for the social media company , with the Cambridge Analytica scandal and multiple security breaches bringing it into disrepute . Despite this , user numbers do n't appear to have suffered as a result ; although public trust in the company has been negatively affected . It remains to be seen whether the other companies named in the New York Times report will release their own statements to explain their involvement in the scandal , but in any case we will continue to update this breaking news story as more information comes to light .
Scammers are targeting companies on Facebook , attempt to con followers into sending Bitcoin payments . Targets have included cryptocurrency mining company Bitmain and tech publication The Verge , which reported the scam to warn its readers . The crooks post comments on the targeted business 's Facebook page , claiming that it has established a partnership with Bitcoin and is giving away a hefty sum of free cryptocurrency . The posts are a type of advance fee scam ( like the infamous Nigerian Prince email hoax ) , and requests that readers send a fee in Bitcoin to `` verify their address '' . The posts claim the money will be refunded immediately with interest – but of course that never happens . “ There are plenty of users creating fake accounts with our profile picture and inputting the same name as Bitmain , ” the company wrote in a Facebook comment . “ We always have these taken down but new ones always come out . ” A similar scam took hold of Twitter in November , with fraudsters impersonating Tesla CEO Elon Musk to trick fans into opening their Bitcoin wallets . Rather than creating new accounts for the job , which would have limited reach , the criminals hijacked the accounts of brands like Matalan and Pantheon Books , then changed their profile pictures and account names to match Musk 's before sharing details of the scam . The idea was that Twitter users following both Musk and the targeted brand would assume they were seeing a legitimate post from the millionaire – and hundreds did , giving the crooks 0.1 Bitcoin ( around $ 380/£300/AU $ 530 ) each for the chance to 'enter ' a giveaway .
With barely two weeks left of 2018 , Facebook has been indicted in yet another privacy and security scandal , following a comprehensive investigation by the New York Times . According to the publication , the user data that Facebook shares with its corporate partners for advertising purposes is far more expansive than previously thought , including everything from contact lists to your private messages . The NYT named Netflix , Spotify , and the Royal Bank of Canada as the companies that were given access to private messages , while other companies like Amazon , Sony , and Microsoft , were given access to information on users ' Facebook friends . Netflix , Spotify , and the Royal Bank of Canada all claim they did n't know how much private data they had been given access to by Facebook . Netflix has also released an official statement , saying : `` Over the years we have tried various ways to make Netflix more social . '' `` One example of this was a feature we launched in 2014 that enabled members to recommend TV shows and movies to their Facebook friends via Messenger or Netflix . It was never that popular so we shut the feature down in 2015 . At no time did we access people ’ s private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so . ” The revelation has come about after the NYT obtained internal documents from Facebook , as well as interviewing former employees . Tech giant Apple also had a special arrangement with Facebook according to the NYT report , which says : `` Facebook empowered Apple to hide from Facebook users all indicators that its devices were asking for data . '' `` Apple devices also had access to the contact numbers and calendar entries of people who had changed their account settings to disable all sharing , the records show . '' This latest report comes after a barrage of privacy scandals afflicted the social media giant this year , including the Cambridge Analytica scandal , which revealed the consulting firm that backed Donald Trump 's 2016 election campaign gathered personal data from around 50 million users . As well as that , a huge data breach earlier this year that compromised the security of 30 million Facebook users , ensured that public trust in the social network has remained in steady decline over 2018 , even though user numbers have n't followed the same trend . It remains to be seen whether this latest scandal will affect user numbers in a meaningful way , but we can be certain about one thing : Facebook has been playing hard and fast with our personal data for a long time , and the Cambridge Analytica scandal was only the tip of the iceberg .

Microsoft dominated Spiceworks ’ recent report that looked at how businesses communicate within small and large businesses . While Skype for Business still remains the undisputed leader of the pack , Microsoft Teams emerged as an interesting alternative and managed to grab a sizable share of the market . We asked Peter Tsai , senior technology analyst at Spiceworks , some questions about that report including why we haven ’ t seen a WordPress for Business chat yet and why we didn ’ t see Amazon Chime and other competitors emerge in the report . Despite Facebook ’ s huge consumer user base , Workplace by Facebook has most likely struggled to get off the ground because companies don ’ t see the need to adopt a paid business version of the social platform , especially given stiff competition from competitors like Microsoft Teams and Slack . If standalone chat apps such as Slack ( which isn ’ t bundled as part of a productivity suite ) , can innovate in ways that others business chat apps can ’ t , they can survive and even thrive . For example , if Slack can continue to introduce new functionality and include more and better integrations with third-party apps than the competition , there will still be a niche for them to carve out . For example , not all organizations use G Suite or Office 365 . Additionally , Spiceworks data shows that small businesses are most likely to adopt Slack , leading us to believe that the app might be best suited for companies with fewer employees , or their free offering may work well enough for smaller organizations . While Teams is replacing Skype for Business as the default chat client in Office 365 , there ’ s still room for both apps to exist , as Teams has more of a focus on workplace group chat , while Skype is more about audio and visual communications . Also , Microsoft is releasing Skype for Business Server 2019 , ensuring the app ’ s future for years to come , especially in enterprises that specifically want an on-premises install of the application . Additionally , the consumer version of the app will continue to use the Skype branding . Finally , some users believe that the communications features in Teams doesn ’ t measure up to the functionality in Skype for Business . For all of these reasons , it makes sense for the applications to say separate because many will still want to use Skype going forward . Email has been around for decades , and despite its flaws , it continues to get the job done . Business chat apps aren ’ t perfect either . Cost as well as security are two potential factors preventing organizations from replacing email with chat . For example , according to Spiceworks data , only 30 % of it pros believe that collaborative chat apps are cheaper than email . Additionally , 58 % of IT pros agree that sensitive files and information should not be sheared through collaborative chat apps . The study focused on vendors that refer to themselves as primarily chat applications vs. other types of collaborative tools such as video conferencing , online meeting tools , etc . Besides Teams continuing to grow at a rapid rate ( largely due to the popularity of Office 365 ) , we can expect all of the competitors to continue to introduce new functionality to remain competitive . For example , Google will evolve their Hangouts platform , having recently split the app into Chat and Meet platforms , which will focus on more Slack-like collaborative team chat and videoconferencing , respectively . Slack will have to continue to be innovative because most businesses use either Microsoft ’ s or Google ’ s productivity suites , which in many cases come bundled with their business chat applications at no additional cost . So in many ways , business chat app adoption will be a reflection of — or perhaps an extension of — the popularity of productivity suites . Slack has already turned down many offers in the past , and Microsoft now has their own Slack competitor , an acquisition is not necessarily in the cards . Besides , it was rumored that Microsoft considered making an offer for Slack a few years ago , but ultimately decided not to . There are open-source applications similar to Slack currently , with names like Mattermost and Rocket.Chat . But because Slack is simple to set up and offers a free version with enough functionality for many , potential users of these open-source competitors may not see the need to seek out alternatives .

The data privacy scandals just keep coming for Facebook : the social network has revealed a flaw in its code that could have exposed the private photos of up to 6.8 million users . The security hole has now been patched , but was open for 12 days . According to Facebook , the bug worked like this : if affected users granted apps access to their timeline photos , those apps could then get at pictures they were n't supposed to be able to see , including images from Facebook Stories and Facebook Marketplace . Even worse , they could see images uploaded to Facebook and not yet posted . That 's right – Facebook keeps copies of pictures you upload to the app and then do n't get around to posting ... just in case you want to come back and finish off the post . These images are kept for three days before being removed , Facebook says . Some 1,500 third-party apps were inadvertently granted a higher level of access than they really should have had . Facebook is notifying the developers of the apps in question , but to what extent they accessed or used photos they should n't have seen is n't clear . `` We 're sorry this happened , '' writes Facebook 's Tomer Bar . `` Early next week we will be rolling out tools for app developers that will allow them to determine which people using their app might be impacted by this bug . We will be working with those developers to delete the photos from impacted users . '' The bug was live in September before being fixed , and Facebook could be in trouble with EU regulators for waiting so long to report it . If you 're one of the users that might have been affected , you should see an alert the next time you log in .

If you allow Facebook access to your smartphone 's location settings , chances are the app already has a pretty good idea of where you are in the world at any given time . But what if Facebook could predict where you are going next ? That 's exactly what could happen in the future according to a patent filed by the social media giant for an application called 'Offline Trajectories ' . According to the wording of the patent , the application could theoretically use your previous location data as well as that of other users to make predictions on where you may be headed next . Take , for example , a typical Tuesday afternoon – perhaps you normally head to the gym straight from work . If the application determines that you are currently at your work address , it could then infer that you are likely to go the gym that afternoon , calculating the probability of you doing so . Why would Facebook want to do this ? Well , if your 4G connection at the gym is prone to dropping out , it might preload your news feed , so you never have to go without your social media fix . But how could Facebook use the data of other users habits to predict your next move ? Another patent for a similar application , named 'Location Prediction Using Wireless Signals on Online Social Networks ' could do just that by examining the habits of users in comparable demographics to you . For example , if you 're visiting Berlin on holiday , Facebook could look at where other users of a similar age group tend to go in the city . Although the company has n't revealed why this data would be useful to them , the likelihood is that knowing where you are likely to go means it can display targeted ads specific to your likely destination . As with any patent application , it 's important to remember that these plans may never even come to fruition . A spokesperson for Facebook told Buzzfeed News that , `` we often seek patents for technology we never implement , and patent applications -- such as this one -- should not be taken as an indication of future plans . '' Whether the proposed technology is ever implemented or not , one thing is for certain – Facebook is always looking for ways to better personalize its applications . And whether that 's a good or bad thing remains to be seen . Via Engadget

Facebook is testing a new video shopping feature , which will work in a similar way to TV channels like QVC . Pages can notify fans when they 're broadcasting , letting shoppers see products in action and use Facebook Live 's interactive features to send questions and receive replies . The seller can then use Messenger to request payments and make reservations . According to TechCrunch , Facebook has launched video shopping for a small sample of pages in Thailand , where it often tests new features ( such as property rental in Marketplace ) . Facebook denies that a global roll-out is imminent , though the fact that some sellers have been invited to join a waiting list suggests an expansion is on the cards in the near future . The company also says it 's working closely with its testers to gather feedback on the feature and improve the experience – again implying that it 'll be available more widely soon – so hold onto your wallet . Facebook has been keen to promote Messenger to businesses this year , and has made several enhancements aimed at sellers . At its F8 2018 developer conference , the company debuted an AI-powered tool for translating text in Marketplace transactions , making it easier for vendors to sell to customers around the world . The service launched in June for English and Spanish . Although it does n't take a cut from sales on Marketplace , Facebook has other ways of making money from the service , and getting more people watching videos means it has more opportunities to show them ads . Autoplaying video ads began appearing in Messenger earlier this year , but commercials in Live shopping videos would be less obtrusive and potentially less annoying .

Following a lawsuit against the social media giant , Facebook has today had some 250 pages worth of internal emails released to the public by the UK Parliament . The documents reveal previously unknown details around the company 's internal behaviour , and seem to reinforce what many critics view as the social network 's anti-competitive nature , alongside its abuse of user data and other troubling issues . This isn ’ t the first time Facebook has been in hot water for dodgy practises – in fact , it ’ s becoming a recurring theme ever since details of the Cambridge Analytica scandal emerged early this year , but the newly-released emails provide a level of detail that 's far more candid than anything previously uncovered . The US lawsuit that 's allowed the release of these emails was put forward by Six4Three , an app developer that claims its Pikinis app was the victim of anti-competitive practises by the social giant . The emails were presented as evidence in that case , in an attempt to display that Facebook has a history of similar anticompetitive practises . Within the emails are several examples of external companies begging Facebook not to remove user data permissions for their products – perhaps the most prominent victim of which is Twitter and its now-defunct Vine social video app . Vine wanted to use Facebook ’ s user data to suggest friends on the service , but after a Facebook executive asked CEO Mark Zuckerberg via email if he could shut this feature down , Zuckerberg replied , “ Yup , go for it ” . Critics have drawn attention to this kind of behavior as being potentially in violation of US and European antitrust and anti-monopoly laws , as the dominant Facebook platform can arguably be seen to be blocking competitors attempts to enter its market . Google has also fallen afoul of antitrust laws in 2018 , with the European Commission fining the tech giant US $ 5 billion for anti-competitive behavior in regards to its Android mobile operating system and the apps it uses by default . “ The facts are clear : we ’ ve never sold people ’ s data ” , reads Facebook ’ s response to the outed emails . That may be technically correct in this instance , however while the company might not have directly traded data for dollars , the emails make a compelling argument that the same outcome was achieved – just with a few extra steps in between . The current controversy centers around the same platform policy change of 2014/15 that ultimately brought us the Cambridge Analytica debacle , which saw Facebook prevent apps from requesting access to friends ’ information . But by selectively “ whitelisting ” certain companies and apps in this policy change , the company was able to protect those apps that brought something to the Facebook platform – such as Airbnb and Netflix – while , it 's argued , simultaneously blocking out any potential threats , such as the aforementioned Vine . While that may not be seen as selling user data directly , revoking competitors ’ access to that data is one way in which Facebook could weaponize customer information for its own profit . Another potentially concerning revelation from the papers has to do with Facebook ’ s acquisition of the now-mammoth chat app , WhatsApp . The purchase was made in February of 2014 and cost the social media giant US $ 19 billion . Facebook utilized a VPN and data analytics service called Onavo to chart the growth of WhatsApp , noticing that it was overtaking the likes of Tumblr and Vine and beginning to threaten Facebook ’ s own Messenger services in terms of popularity . Facebook purchased Onavo for US $ 100 million in 2013 – a year before its WhatsApp acquisition – a move which critics argue allowed the social media giant to track WhatsApp and other rising adversaries and nip them in the bud without any threat of competition . In response to the public release of documents , Facebook is effectively claiming that 'it ’ s not what it looks like ' , stating ( perhaps fairly ) that the documents were purposefully `` cherrypicked '' by the company behind the lawsuit , and don ’ t accurately detail both sides of the story . Facebook ’ s statement goes into specifics , detailing each of the concerns raised thus far by the exposed communications , although arguably , many of the provided answers do not completely address the issues raised – in some cases going off on tangents and pointing towards other mechanisms involved . The emails are also likely to raise more concerns over the coming days , as critics and regulators delve deeper into the dense cache of exposed communications .

UPDATE : In our original story below , we mentioned that Facebook was negotiating with Apple to have its enterprise credentials restored . According to Bloomberg reporter Sarah Frier , that has come to pass and a Facebook spokesperson has confirmed that the social media platform is working to get the internal apps working again . Original story ... Despite the odd hiccup , over the last couple of years Apple has become a strong proponent of safeguarding user privacy . Facebook , it seems , didn ’ t get the memo . Immediately following the news that the social media giant paid users to install a “ research ” app that tracks and records phone and web activity , Apple revoked Facebook ’ s enterprise developer certificate . This countermand means Facebook ’ s internal iOS apps , including those used by employees for food and transportation , have been blocked . The Verge reports that beta versions of Instagram , Messenger and WhatsApp have stopped working , and that “ Facebook is treating this as a critical problem ” . This isn ’ t the first time Facebook has done something underhanded . Hot on the heels of the Cambridge Analytica scandal came the news that Facebook ’ s Onavo Protect VPN app was collecting user data , something that has been against Apple ’ s guidelines since last year . Apple banned the app in June 2018 and , by August , it was removed from the App Store . Despite being warned , Facebook decided to circumvent the App Store to distribute the “ Project Atlas ” research app ( as first reported by TechCrunch ) by taking advantage of Apple ’ s Developer Enterprise Program which allows business partners to test and distribute apps to their own employees without any review from Apple . In a statement , the Cupertino firm said that the Program was designed “ solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization ” . “ Any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked , which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data , ” the tech giant added . The internal versions of Facebook apps used by employees carry bits of code for updates or new features that aren ’ t available to the public . By revoking Facebook ’ s enterprise developer certificate , Apple has stopped these apps from even launching on employee handsets , thereby severely limiting Facebook ’ s ability to create new apps or update existing ones for iOS . Facebook is currently trying to negotiate with Apple to get the apps working on employee devices , but there seems to be some chatter about Apple completely removing Facebook-owned apps from the App Store . However , Facebook isn ’ t the only company guilty of violating Apple ’ s Developer Enterprise Program . TechCrunch found that Google ’ s ScreenWise Meter app is also guilty of doing the same . Google , however , has told TechCrunch that it will remove the app from the Program and disable it on iOS devices .

In an effort to obtain even more user data , Facebook has secretly been paying users to install a “ Facebook Research ” VPN that tracks and records all of their phone and web activity . A similar app from the company called Onavo Protect was banned by Apple in June and removed from its App Store in August . Despite warnings from Apple , Facebook decided to bypass the App Store and continue to gather information on users through its Research app though this time the social network was found to be targeting the data of teenagers and young adults . Since 2016 , the company has paid users between ages 13 and 35 up to $ 20 per month ( as well as referral fees ) to sell their data and privacy by installing its now controversial app on iOS or Android . Facebook was able to skirt Apple 's stringent review policies by deploying its VPN app through beta testing services Applause , BetaBound and uTest . As a result of the controversy surrounding Onavo Protect , Facebook began to refer to its Research app as Project Atlas which it used to continue collecting user data in blatant disregard to Apple 's policies . The company used beta testing services to recruit teens to its cause though the social network 's name was purposely left out . By agreeing to have data collected on the apps on their devices as well as their web history , users were given digital gift cards worth $ 20 . Apple has its own beta testing service called TestFlight which requires apps to be reviewed by the company and participation is limited to 10,000 people . Facebook decided to avoid Apple 's service entirely to carry out its nefarious scheme . The company 's VPN app required users to provide root access to their device and once this was done , they had to keep the VPN running and sending data to the social network to get paid . At a time when Facebook is still dealing with last year 's Cambridge Analytica scandal , the last thing the company needs is even more negative exposure and being found out for stealthily harvesting data from teens could lead to even more users closing their accounts for good .

Facebook is planning on integrating its three popular messaging services – Instagram , WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger – so that they work closer together . According to a report in the New York Times , Facebook ’ s chief executive , Mark Zuckerberg , has ordered developers to rebuild the three services “ at their most basic levels . ” The good news is that this doesn ’ t mean that the three services will get merged into one single messaging service , but instead their underlying messaging infrastructures will be unified , potentially allowing messages sent using one service to be read on another . The move will require all the apps to use end-to-end encryption , which is a security measure used in WhatsApp to ensure that people outside of conversations can not read private messages . While at first this news could be worrying – especially to people who have been wary about using Facebook but still want to use WhatsApp and Instagram after the social network took them over – it might not be all that bad . For a start , it doesn ’ t look like Facebook is planning to completely merge the services ( for now at least ) . Spreading end-to-end encryption to the other messaging services is also a welcome move . Plus , it means that someone using Facebook Messenger could potentially send a message to a friend on WhatsApp without the friend having to have a Facebook account . Still , according to the New York Times , this move has prompted controversy within Facebook , with Instagram ’ s founders , Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger quitting last year apparently because of Zuckerberg ’ s increased control over the service . WhatsApp ’ s founders , Jan Koum and Brian Acton also left Facebook , again apparently due to similar concerns . The news that Facebook will be closely integrating the three services is certainly a change in how the company previously dealt with the separate platforms . Previously , Facebook was careful to keep the services independent from each other , with Zuckerberg assuring users of WhatsApp and Instagram that the services would remain autonomous . With scandals piling up for Facebook , that autonomy was increasingly important to many of the users . However , they could also be the reason for Zuckerberg wanting to combine the various services his company runs , while taking on more control over them . Whatever the reasons , the process is likely to take its time , with the New York Times suggesting that Facebook is in the early stages of the process , and that it will likely complete the integration by the end of this year , or by early 2020 . Facebook has also confirmed to the BBC that this is just the start of a “ long process ” . When TechRadar reached out for comment , a Facebook spokesperson told us : “ We want to build the best messaging experiences we can ; and people want messaging to be fast , simple , reliable and private . We 're working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks . As you would expect , there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work . ” So , for anyone who uses WhatsApp and Instagram but doesn ’ t like Facebook , we wouldn ’ t be too worried just yet .

Mad as Hell about something ? Not going to take it any more ? Well , you 're in luck , because Facebook is currently rolling out a new tool in the US that will let users create and support online petitions , as reported by TechCrunch . Called Community Actions , the petitions will appear directly on the site 's News Feed , both publicly and for friends , allowing users to tag organizations or elected officials in order to bring more attention to the chosen cause . Along with following and clicking 'Support ' on a Community Action , users will be able to share their own testimonials or media in the petition 's comments section . The idea is that the cause will eventually go viral and reach as many people as possible . Of course , it 's very likely that people will misuse the tool in order to post hateful or inappropriate petitions . With that in mind , Facebook will be monitoring all the Community Actions on its site , employing human moderators along with user flagging and algorithmic detection . `` Community Action is another way for people to advocate for changes in their communities and partner with elected officials and government agencies on solutions , '' said a spokesperson for the social network . Facebook has been testing the new tool in select markets over the last several weeks , with requests for a moratorium on new drilling in Colorado , a new performing arts center in Florida and better crosswalks near a Philadelphia library already gaining traction among locals . While it 's always been possible to share petitions from sites like Change.org across Facebook , building a petition creation tool directly into the site could be a real game-changer in terms of virality and reach . It 's also bound to be an exceptional tool for determining which of your friends is most insufferable . The Community Actions functionality is rolling out now across the US , though no word has been offered yet on when it will reach other territories .

Facebook 's attempts to win back the eyeballs of teenagers are n't slowing down , if new reports are to be believed : the social network is apparently testing a meme-filled feature called LOL with selected users , based around short , shareable video clips . TechCrunch reported the trial run , which Facebook has since confirmed – the idea is to pack LOL with funny videos and GIF-style loops so that youngsters might be tempted to spend a little bit more time away from Instagram and Snapchat . Content gets pulled from the News Feed and the best meme pages on Facebook , apparently . For now only around 100 high school students in the US have access to LOL , and they 're presumably giving feedback to Facebook engineers as to why this is the best or worst idea in the history of social networking . Facebook says the concept is in its `` early stages '' . Of course we 've been here before . In 2014 Facebook launched Slingshot , a Snapchat clone which has since been abandoned . Then late in 2018 it introduced Lasso , also based around short and shareable video clips , which is apparently still going . The problem from the perspective of Mark Zuckerberg and his fellow execs is not just that teens are leaving Facebook – Facebook owns Instagram , after all – but that they 're sharing content and memes in ways that are difficult to monetize . The short-lived , ephemeral Stories style introduced by Snapchat has become the most popular way to keep in touch . For now it 's not clear if LOL might become part of the Facebook app , arrive as a separate app , or never launch publicly at all . It might even roll into Facebook Watch ( Facebook 's home for videos and original content , if you 've completely missed it ) .

There 's a lot of love for Facebook 's new Portal smart display on Amazon - from Facebook 's own employees , at least . The Portal and Portal+ are Facebook 's attempt to enter the smart home market , with a screen-based smart display to offer video chat services . But it seems some of the more glowing praise found online is from Facebook employees - which they 're not really meant to be doing . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 New York Times columnist @ kevinroose posted the revelation on Twitter , showing how a number of five-star reviews on the Portal 's Amazon product page were signed off by the names of Facebook employees - an accusation confirmed by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth . You can read Bosworth 's comment to Roose 's tweet below . neither coordinated nor directed from the company . From an internal post at the launch : “ We , unequivocally , DO NOT want Facebook employees to engage in leaving reviews for the products that we sell to Amazon. ” We will ask them to take down.January 17 , 2019 Smart displays are big business nowadays , with success of the likes of the Google Home Hub and Amazon Echo Show showing an appetite for tablet-like home appliances . Facebook 's forays into the market , the Portal the Portal+ , did n't receive a huge amount of fanfare at launch , which may have had something to do with ongoing concerns about the company 's use of customer data . Facebook admitted as much , telling news site Recode that `` Portal voice calling is built on the Messenger infrastructure , so when you make a video call on Portal , we collect the same types of information ( i.e . usage data such as length of calls , frequency of calls ) that we collect on other Messenger-enabled devices . '' Whether positive reviews from Facebook 's own employees are enough to allay those fears remains to be seen . Via SlashGear
A report by Business Insider has revealed that Facebook has moved hundreds of employee from its research team , Facebook Reality Labs , to a team that focuses specifically on augmented reality hardware . The findings have led to speculation that Facebook could release its long awaited augmented reality glasses sometime soon – although we aren ’ t holding our breath for a 2019 release . Or even a release this side of 2025 for that matter . We ’ ve known that Facebook is working on augmented reality glasses for a while now , since the company ’ s announcement at the F8 2017 developer conference . Since then , we ’ ve not heard much more about the AR glasses , save for Mark Zuckerburg telling Recode in April 2017 that “ we do not have the science or technology today to build the AR glasses we was want ” , but that the technology could feasibly exist in “ five years , or seven years ” . While the Business Insider report cites a source who says the glasses could be ready by 2022 , a Facebook spokesperson has denied this , saying that the social media company is working on a number of AR products that may never even have official launches . According to a 2017 patent , the AR glasses could use a ‘ waveguide display ' to combine computer graphics with the real world – essentially an advanced method of giving the illusion of depth on specs right in front of your face . Based on the patent images , the AR glasses could look just like a regular pair of glasses , which means there will be lot of complex , miniaturized technology to get right before they can be released . Whether or not we ’ ll see the long awaited AR glasses before 2025 is unknown , but it at least looks like Facebook is looking to throw money and resources at its burgeoning AR department .

Facebook has released a new open source tool that makes uploading high-res photos on mobile devices gobble less data allowance . Spectrum is an image processing library for Android and iOS that Facebook uses to make image uploads in its own apps faster and smoother . The company has now made it available on Github for any developers building apps that allow users to upload pictures . `` We hope that Spectrum will benefit developers in the same way it 's helped Facebook create a better image production experience , '' the company said . `` In our apps , Spectrum has improved reliability and quality of image uploads across our apps . '' Phone cameras are improving in leaps and bounds , which means better quality images , but also larger files that take forever to upload . Uploading full-resolution pictures is also wasteful if they 're going to be resized at the other end anyway , which is what happens when you upload them to Facebook and Instagram . Spectrum reduces the size of the image on your phone , so it requires less bandwidth to send , while optimizing image quality . `` The default integration with Mozilla JPEG allows a reduction of up to 15 % in upload file size compared to a baseline encoder , '' said Facebook . `` We are excited to see how the community uses the Spectrum 1.0.0 library to improve the photo experiences in applications .

Facebook is facing increasing scrutiny over the way it handles ( or mishandles ) user data , with regulators in Germany hoping to legally restrict the scope of Facebook 's data collection practices through third-party apps . Only last month , it emerged that various third party companies – like Netflix , Spotify and Apple – were given access to huge swathes of Facebook 's user data , and could even `` read , write , and delete users ' private messages '' . Last year too , we reported on how the Facebook-owned WhatsApp was sharing user 's payment information with its parent company . According the Bild am Sonntag , Germany 's Federal Cartel Office looking to call a halt to some of Facebook 's data collection , primarily with regards to third-party apps . Facebook accounts often integrate with a variety of other services – say , when setting up a Bumble or Spotify profile – and the way data is shared between those services is n't always clear to the average user . German regulators are expected to give Facebook some sort of timeframe to implement the changes . Facebook are currently denying any overreach with its data collection , though with the spectre of a €10 million fine for failure to comply , their resistance may not last that long . ( That 's around £9m , $ 11.5m , or AU $ 11.5m with current exchange rates . ) Data privacy is proving an increasingly thorny issue in the wake of GDPR – the EU 's new legal guidelines for data privacy – which has forced media companies to explicate what data it 's collecting from users , and give them the chance to refuse .

If you like an audience for your virtual reality antics , then you ’ ll doubtless be pleased to learn that the Oculus Rift is about to offer all users the ability to livestream to Facebook . Yes , the first update of 2019 for the Oculus Rift– which is available on the public test channel now , and will roll out later in January for everyone – introduces streaming to Facebook Live , assuming that the game or app you are running supports the feature . Read more : Oculus Rift S Your Facebook audience will see exactly what you ’ re experiencing in virtual reality with a live broadcast . The caveat , as mentioned , is that developers have to opt-in and support the live streaming feature for their apps . Currently , hundreds of apps apparently have support ready to roll , and they include Echo VR , VR Sports Challenge , and Wild West shooter Dead & Buried . If you want to show off to your friends , family , or anyone else who cares to watch , simply head to the Dash Menu when you ’ re in VR and hit the Livestream to Facebook button . It ’ s as easy as that . Oculus is also introducing Public Homes with this update , and as the name suggests , this means you can open your VR Home to visitors by flicking a switch to make it public . Users will be given recommendations of Public Homes they might want to visit , and the idea is to make it easy to find folks who share your interests . And of course you may get some inspiration for how to do-up your own VR space by looking at other people ’ s homes . Public Homes will arrive with a raft of tools to manage your privacy and give you control over the guest list of visitors , so you can decline a request to look at your space , or indeed disable the public option entirely , should you think better of it down the line . Furthermore , it ’ s possible to report any abuse you get from visitors intent on griefing and the like , and you can mute them , too , if necessary . As with Facebook livestreaming , this is still in beta and only available to testers right now , with a broader rollout to the general Oculus Rift population expected later in January . Via Engadget

Glancing at Messenger first thing in the morning can feel a little like being woken up with a flashbang , particularly if your smartphone has an especially bright screen . However , that problem could soon be a thing of the past , with noted app-teardown expert Jane Manchun Wong revealing on Twitter that the Android version of Facebook 's popular messaging application is currently testing its upcoming 'dark mode ' , as reported by Android Police . The catch ? The test is currently only available to select users in certain countries – neither Facebook nor Wong have indicated which regions have access , though based on TechRadar testing it did n't include the US or Australia at time of writing . Facebook Messenger is testing Dark Mode in the new UIpreviously : https : //t.co/vT6WoKikPm pic.twitter.com/A6ETE45BPNOctober 5 , 2018 According to Wong , users with access to Messenger 's new dark mode can find a toggle for the setting within the app 's 'Me ' section . Of course , as the new mode is only in its testing phase , it 's far from complete – an in-app 'work in progress ' message from Facebook reportedly states that `` While we put the finishing touches on dark mode , it wo n't appear everywhere in Messenger . '' Facebook Messenger , seemingly due to prolonged external nagging , has started public testing Dark Mode in certain countriesThey have put up a fair warning that Dark Mode is n't everywhere yet so do n't complain when some UI burns your eyes offpreviously : https : //t.co/9fCvbYXS5Z pic.twitter.com/wF3w5hsHfhDecember 31 , 2018 The dark mode test comes shortly after a recent minimalistic UI makeover , which saw Messenger reduce its number of tabs and refine some of its clunkier design aspects . It 's unclear when Messenger 's dark mode will roll out to more territories , but we 'll keep you posted when it does .

Facebook ’ s ‘ clear history ’ feature will launch later this year , according to the social media network ’ s CFO David Wehner . The feature was first announced at the F8 conference in 2018 , with Mark Zuckerberg describing how feature as “ a simple control to clear your browsing history on Facebook – what you 've clicked on , websites you 've visited , and so on . ” The ability to control what Facebook shares about you with other sites , as well as being to see what apps and websites you ’ ve interacted with using your Facebook account , is a feature that many users have been asking for , especially in light of several high profile privacy controversies that have plagued Facebook recently . As CNBC reports , Wehner revealed that the feature is coming later in the year at the Morgan Stanley Technology , Media & Telecom Conference 2019 in San Francisco . While the ‘ clear history ’ feature will be broadly welcomed by users and privacy advocates , it will have implications on what adverts are shown to you . As Wehner explained , the feature is “ going to give us some headwinds in terms of being able to target as effectively as before. ” With Facebook unable to use data collected by third parties , it could struggle to target relevant ads . However , for most people this will be a price worth paying for greater control over the information Facebook shares about them . Plus , the social media network has plenty of other methods for harvesting user data to supply relevant adverts .

Facebook is removing its Onavo VPN app from the Google Play Store and ending its unpaid market research programs following backlash over how the social network paid teens to spy on them . The company 's Onavo Protect app will stop collecting user data through its virtual private network ( VPN ) and will eventually shut down after giving users time to find an alternative app to replace it . Facebook will also stop recruiting new users for its Facebook Research App that is no longer available on iOS but is still operating on Android . When Apple discovered that the company was misusing its Enterprise Certificate program , which is meant for internal company apps only , it revoked all of the social network 's certificates and broke Facebook 's own apps in the process . Facebook first acquired Onavo back in 2013 for around $ 200m with the aim of using its VPN app to secretly gather data about how consumers use their smartphones . Even before its Research App existed , this data revealed that consumers were sending twice as many WhatsApp messages than those sent from its own Messenger app which led it to purchase the company for $ 19bn . Facebook then tried to convince users that Onavo was a great way to reduce data usage , block dangerous websites and protect their internet traffic from snooping while it secretly analyzed their web usage itself . The company has now decided to remove Onavo from the Play Store before Google decides to block it while ending recruitment of new Facebook Research testers . Facebook has certainly made the right move in this scenario but lawmakers and regulators could still seek legal action against the company for the way in which it mishandled user data so greatly .

Facebook has announced new controls for its Android app that will make it easier to stop the app knowing your location when you 're not using it . iOS lets you choose whether you share location data with apps all the time , only when the app is in use , or never , but Android does n't give you that much control . If you let Facebook know where you are , it 'll know whether you 've got the app open or not . As Facebook explains , selecting the new option will give you more privacy . For example , that anyone living close by who uses the 'Nearby friends ' option wo n't be able to see you unless you 're using the Facebook app . If you 've previously turned location sharing off , you do n't need to worry – it will stay turned off when the app is updated . If you 're using iOS , you wo n't see any changes , but the app will prompt you to check your settings and make sure you 're happy with them .

Facebook is in need of far stricter regulation due to its inability to stop the spread of fake news , and also for failing to keep user data private , a government report has said . The declaration by the Digital , Culture , Media and Sport Committee follows a year-long investigation into Facebook 's failings , and recommends that the UK puts far stricter restrictions on the social media giant immediately . Although focusing on several other companies , including Google and YouTube , the report called out Facebook for specific criticism , particularly over its failings to stop the spread of 'disinformation ' . `` Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts ' from unidentifiable sources , delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day , '' the report 's conclusion read . `` The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content , and to respect their data privacy rights . '' Facebook 's links to discredited firm Cambridge Analytica came under particular scrutiny , with the site criticised for its lax handling of users ' private data . The site was fined £500,000 by the ICO last year , the maximum penalty under GDPR law , for mishandling user data in the scandal . The committee report claimed this point to be a `` radical shift in the balance of power between social media platforms and the people '' and recommended greater regulation on Facebook 's gathering of personal information . It called for a compulsory code of ethics for tech companies , overseen by an independent regulator , social media companies to be forced to take down known sources of harmful content , including proven sources of disinformation , and for tech companies operating in the UK to be taxed to help fund the work for the Information Commissioner 's Office and any new regulator set up to oversee them . In response , Facebook said it welcomed the report 's findings , and said it would be amenable to `` meaningful regulation '' . `` We share the committee 's concerns about false news and election integrity and are pleased to have made a significant contribution to their investigation over the past 18 months , answering more than 700 questions and with four of our most senior executives giving evidence , '' the company said . We have already made substantial changes so that every political ad on Facebook has to be authorised , state who is paying for it and then is stored in a searchable archive for seven years . No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do . ''

Facebook has been ordered to limit the amount of information it gathers on its users as the backlash against the social media giant continues . A German court has ruled that Facebook will need to cut down on collecting user data across different platforms unless customers have given explicit consent . The ruling from the German competition regulator ( FCO ) comes after the body declared it believes Facebook took advantage of its market dominance to gather up huge amounts of user data . `` In future , Facebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted collection and assigning of non-Facebook data to their Facebook user accounts , '' said FCO president Andreas Mundt . `` The combination of data sources substantially contributed to the fact that Facebook was able to build a unique database for each individual user and thus to gain market power . '' The ruling will apply not just on Facebook , but across WhatsApp and Instagram - both of which are owned by the company , and will soon be integrated by Facebook to share messaging services . The FCO has said that the different platforms can continue to collect data , but this will need to be kept separate from other services unless the user gives their permission . In a similar vein , Facebook will only be allowed to collate data from third-party websites and link it to a user 's account only if they have given consent . On the company 's main site , this could mean that Facebook will need to amend its Like and Share buttons , both of which allow the firm to track a users IP address , web browser type and version , as well as other data that allows Facebook to identify a user personally . The ruling is only applicable in Germany for now , but with Facebook currently under investigation in several other countries , could influence its future activities across the world . Failing to abide by the ruling could see Facebook fined up to 10 percent of its annual revenues . Facebook hit back at the ruling in a blog post , noting that collecting such data allows it to display better targeted ads to its users , as well as making it easier to identify fake and harmful accounts . `` The GDPR specifically empowers data protection regulators - not competition authorities - to determine whether companies have lived up to their responsibilities , '' it said . `` And data protection regulators certainly have the expertise to make those conclusions . '' `` The [ FCO ] order threatens to undermine this , providing different rights to people based on the size of the companies they do business with . ''

As you ’ ll likely have seen , Facebook recently hit the ripe old age of 15 . It ’ s hard to believe that it ’ s really been around for that long . Whilst Facebook was not strictly the first social media platform , in many ways it has been the most impactful , and the granddaddy of social media as we know it today . Countless imitators have sought to usurp the throne from Facebook , but few have even come close to replicating its scale and scope . A lot has changed since Facebook ’ s birth in a university dorm in 2004 . The iPhone was still three years away , online shopping accounted for around two per cent of UK retail sales ( compared to 10 times that now ) , and broadband was found in only 12 per cent of British homes . It was a simpler time , digitally speaking . Unbeknownst to the public of 2004 , Facebook was to become one of the most valuable companies in the world , and it was to be built on a commodity people didn ’ t even realise they possessed , let alone that they needed to protect – their personal data . Facebook ’ s wildly successful data-driven business model shone a light on the true power and value of data . Data is often called the new oil . Whilst the comparison has been done to death at this point , it ’ s undeniable that data has been fuelling businesses for the past dozen or so years . Businesses live and die on the quality of their data , and they ’ ve become increasingly skilled at acquiring , analysing and using it . Over 90 per cent of all data has been created in the last few years . Our increasingly online lives mean we are constantly creating greater and greater volumes of data . A Domo report puts the data we generate every day at around 2.5 quintillion bytes . Data protection , whilst certainly not a consideration in 2004 , has become an increasingly important topic . With seemingly everything we do generating data , the public mindset needs to focus on thinking more carefully about the data they dole out to companies , and whether they trust them as its custodians . We have witnessed this trust abused in recent years , often by Facebook , but in no way exclusively . Data has been misused , misplaced and stolen on an unprecedented scale . Whilst new regulations such as GDPR have put tighter controls on companies ’ use of customer data , with Google the largest and most recent company to be hit with the regulatory cosh , the inherent value of data means it will always be sought after by unscrupulous individuals operating outside a regulatory framework . As Facebook hits this grand milestone , it should serve as a reminder to businesses that the world is a very different place to 2004 , and the valuable data they have built their current positions on is prized not only by themselves . They are bursting at the seams with data , and as such , they are targets . The greater the prize , the greater the lengths criminals will go to possess it . In the last several years we have seen a proliferation in the variety and sophistication of cyberthreats , and increased organisation amongst cybercriminal groups . This necessitates a new approach to cybersecurity , one that focuses not solely on prevention , but detection . With the myriad of new threats out there , it ’ s almost an inevitability that a company will be compromised . Being able to identify when this has happened , rather than simply that it has happened , is incredibly valuable . Last year ’ s Marriott hackers had undetected access to systems for four years before they were discovered . Integration of NextGen SIEM and User and Entity Behaviour Analytics ( UEBA ) solutions can ensure that , if the worst were to happen , a company would be able to detect and neutralise the threat straightaway . Facebook reaching 15 years old , with a valuation of hundreds of billions , has relied heavily on it being one of the first to comprehend the true value of its users ’ personal data . It was able to flourish and expand so quickly because it was dealing with a public which didn ’ t . Fifteen years on , however , the excuse of ignorance no longer holds water . All that has happened since 2004 – the hacks , breaches and scandals serve as an important reminder to the public that their data is valuable , and they need to ensure that any company they entrust with it can be relied upon to secure it and use it responsibly . It should also remind businesses that the mistakes of the past can not be repeated . They have responsibility to safeguard their customers ’ data and , as the cyber landscape becomes ever more sophisticated and dangerous , that they must take as many precautions as they can to do so .

Social media giant Facebook is reportedly building a unified messaging for business feature that will allow companies to access and manage Instagram Direct messages alongside Facebook Messenger messages . Last month , The New York Times reported that the company was planning to unite the back-end technology running Instagram , Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp on the consumer side . Now though , it appears that Facebook is also building a tool to do the exact same thing with its apps for business . The company 's new feature will add Instagram Direct messaging to the messaging inbox inside the Facebook Pages Manager app on both desktop and mobile . Currently the tool only allows businesses to receive and interact with messages from Facebook Messenger . End users will be unable to see the difference between a message sent on Instagram and one sent on Facebook Messenger as the function would exist only on the front-end for business page mangers . Facebook 's decision to unite the backed of its three messaging services has the potential to shake up the business messaging space as the company looks to gain a foothold in the growing market . As users spend more time with its messaging apps , this could help grow its advertising business and while there there are currently no monetization plans for its combined messaging experience , the idea has been discussed by the company . Facebook 's messaging tools are used as a B2B communication platform between vendors and consumers with 150m people using Instagram to talk with businesses and 10bn messages sent between consumers and businesses every month on Facebook Messenger . As of now , the company has yet to announce anything regarding the possibility of combining Instagram and Facebook Messenger into a unified messaging service but if the rumors are true , we could likely hear an announcement soon . Via Axios
We ’ ve been anticipating its arrival since November of last year , and now Facebook has finally begun rolling out an ‘ unsend ’ feature for its widely-used messaging service . Whether you 're using the dedicated Messenger app on iOS or Android or the browser-based version on desktop , are now able to delete a message from a regular conversation or group chat within 10 minutes of sending it . On mobile devices , you can access the feature by tapping on a message in the app , which will now show a new 'remove ' menu item . Selecting the latter will then display two further options : ‘ remove for you ’ and ‘ remove for everyone ’ . On desktop , users will need to click on the three dots next to a message and hit ‘ remove ’ , after which you ’ ll get the same two options . It ’ s worth noting that once a message has been removed , everyone in the chat will be able to see a replacement message stating that “ [ person ] removed a message ” – meaning you may not quite be able to just switch off your verbal filter and say whatever comes to mind , whenever you want . While it may seem like a long time , the 10-minute time limit is also a little short , comparatively – WhatsApp , for example , gives users a whole hour to delete messages – and does n't give users very much time to realize they 've made a mistake . The ability to retract messages has become increasingly common on communications services – there 's even an 'undo send ' option in Gmail – and the introduction of the feature to Facebook Messenger follows a promise made by the company in April 2018 after CEO Mark Zuckerberg was caught abusing the power himself . The feature doesn ’ t currently appear to be available on Messenger Lite , but we may see it land on this stripped-down version of the service in the near future .

It 's not been an easy couple of years for Facebook in terms of user privacy and data security and everything else , but the giant social network seems determined to start sorting out at least some of its problems . TechCrunch reports on an open letter published by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg , in which she says the platform is `` exploring restrictions '' for limiting who can launch livestreams . The letter comes in response to the terror attack in Christchurch , New Zealand , which was streamed live over Facebook by the perpetrators . Facebook is ready to support the grieving community in New Zealand , Sandberg says , and will be taking further steps to address hate speech on its platform – although she did n't go into too much detail about what that would involve . In a separate op-ed in the Washington Post , Facebook founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg says governments and regulators should take on more of a role in policing social networks . Zuckerberg is calling for new laws in four separate areas , reports the BBC : harmful content , election integrity , privacy and data portability . `` Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech , and frankly I agree , '' Zuckerberg writes , saying that the responsibility of restricting hate speech is too much of a challenge for individual sites and apps to tackle alone . Zuckerberg wants to see a code of conduct that all social media networks must abide by , tighter restrictions on how political parties can campaign online , and new rules for protecting the privacy of users as they move their data between services .

As you may be aware , elections for the European parliament take place in late May , and Facebook has outlined the measures it is implementing to ensure that politics-related ads are more transparent , while preventing any potential election meddling shenanigans . This is no surprise , as Facebook announced that these sort of measures would be incoming for elections in 2019 in various countries ( such as India ) as well as the EU , in order to protect the political process from being influenced by external nations or other interfering third-parties . The steps the social network is taking were detailed in a post by Richard Allan , VP of Global Policy Solutions , and they broadly revolve around a couple of key points , including checking the legitimacy of advertisers , and clearly labelling political adverts . Verifying that companies running adverts are actually who they say they are will involve advertisers in the EU having to be authorized in their country to run election-related ads . The advertisers in question will have to submit documents to prove both their identity and location , with Facebook instigating ‘ technical checks ’ to confirm this . Allan does , however , note : “ We recognize that some people can try and work around any system but we are confident this will be a real barrier for anyone thinking of using our ads to interfere in an election from outside of a country . ” As to the second point , Facebook will insist that any political ads – or so-called ‘ issue ’ adverts about big issues , such as immigration , for example – must include a disclosure showing clearly who has paid for that advertising . That disclosure will include contact details for the company in question , and you ’ ll be able to click to reveal further info on any political ad , such as the campaign budget behind it , and how many people have viewed the advert . Essentially , this is a drive for a greater level of transparency when it comes to political advertising on Facebook , and this also holds true for adverts on Instagram , by the way . Allan observed : “ We are inviting all political campaigns to start the ads authorization process now and we will start to block political or issue ads that have not been properly registered from mid-April . ” Finally , Facebook is also implementing a new tool for Europe called the Ad Library , which keeps track of all political or issue-related adverts , and grants access to information on the number of ad views , demographics , and so forth . This data will be kept for seven years , with the idea being that regulators can get easy access to all these details going back a long way , should they need to investigate any issue related to an election . The Ad Library is already live in the US , where it was previously called the Ad Archive . Allan also noted that once these rules are in effect , if you spot an advert which you believe is related to politics , but isn ’ t labelled as such – and doesn ’ t have the aforementioned disclosure details – you should report it to Facebook and it will subsequently be reviewed .

Since the tragic events at the white supremacist march in Charlottesville , Virginia , in 2017 , Facebook has tried to weed out racist and hateful content . The social media giant banned posts relating to white supremacy , but controversially maintained that white nationalism and white separatism were different . Following discussions on content moderation at Facebook ’ s Content Standards Forum , that policy has now been revised , with Facebook implementing a carpet ban on posts and comments relating to white supremacy , nationalism or separatism . According to the new rules , explained in a Facebook Newsroom post , users searching for , or posting , content relating to hateful or racist rhetoric will be redirected to Life After Hate , a not-for-profit organization that helps individuals wean themselves away from violent far-right groups . Facebook has admitted that it considered white nationalism to be an acceptable point of view . According to internal training documents obtained by Vice News ’ Motherboard last year , phrases like “ I am proud to be a white nationalist ” was permissible on the social media platform , but calling oneself “ a white supremacist ” was banned . The documents , citing Wikipedia as sources , claimed white nationalism “ doesn ’ t seem to be always associated with racism ( at least not explicitly ) ” and that white nationalists “ carefully avoid the term supremacy because it has negative connotations ” . After facing backlash from academic experts for its content moderation policies , Facebook spent three months discussing the issue with anti-hate groups to conclude that white nationalism “ can not be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups ” . “ Going forward , while people will still be able to demonstrate pride in their ethnic heritage , we will not tolerate praise or support for white nationalism and separatism , ” Facebook announced . This move has been praised by racial justice advocacy groups even though it was “ long overdue ” . The policy applies to both Facebook and Instagram and will go into effect next week .

A new report from Krebs On Security has revealed that Facebook stored the account passwords of hundreds of millions of users in plain text and they were easily searchable by thousands of its own employees in some cases going back to 2012 . According to a senior employee familiar with the investigation , the social networking giant is currently probing a series of security failures in which employees wrote applications that logged unencrypted password data for Facebook users and stored this information in plain text on internal company servers . So far , the investigation has discovered that between 200m and 600m Facebook users may have had their account passwords stored on its servers and searchable by over 20,000 employees . The company is still trying to determine exactly how many passwords were exposed and for how long but archives with plain text user passwords have been discovered that date back to 2012 . Access logs at Facebook show that around 2,000 engineers or developers made nine million internal queries for data elements that contained plain text user passwords . Software engineer at Facebook , Scott Renfro provided further insight into the ongoing investigation to Krebs On Security in an interview , saying : “ We ’ ve not found any cases so far in our investigations where someone was looking intentionally for passwords , nor have we found signs of misuse of this data . In this situation what we ’ ve found is these passwords were inadvertently logged but that there was no actual risk that ’ s come from this . We want to make sure we ’ re reserving those steps and only force a password change in cases where there ’ s definitely been signs of abuse . ” Affected users will not have to change their passwords as they were not leaked outside of the company , though Facebook is preparing to notify “ hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users , tens of millions of other Facebook users , and tens of thousands of Instagram users ” .

For users of Facebook Messenger that aren ’ t quite quick enough to get a reply in before their conversation has moved on , the social media giant has finally answered your needs . As first reported by VentureBeat , Facebook has begun rolling out a new feature to Messenger that allows users to respond to specific messages in a chat rather than to the last received message . When long-pressing on any message in a group or solo conversation – whether it be a GIF , video , image or just text – the option to reply directly will appear next to the series of emoji reactions that have been available for some time . Messenger has seen a string of updates recently , with the ability to unsend messages and a new dark mode rolling out in the last few months . Considering Facebook intends to integrate WhatsApp , Instagram and Messenger by 2020 , it ’ s likely that more pre-existing features from each platform will be shared to the others . Facebook hopes that having a more unified infrastructure for its messaging and social platforms will help keep its users ’ data secure , such as would be allowed by Instagram and Messenger adopting the end-to-end encryption already in use by WhatsApp , for instance . This push has been outlined by Mark Zuckerberg in an extensive post about Facebook ’ s change of focus from public posts to private messages – a response to the user data controversies the platform experienced in recent years .

According to Facebook , there are roughly 700 million users across the globe who engage in video game-related content each month , whether it 's chatting in gaming communities , playing games or watching people stream . In an effort to bring these people together and give them a new home for gaming , the social network has announced that it 's currently rolling out an updated version of its mobile app that brings a brand new dedicated Facebook Gaming tab . Once updated , the refreshed app will include its new tab in the main navigation bar , allowing users to jump directly to video game news , streams , groups and other related content . Play , watch , connect and discover in a new , dedicated Facebook Gaming tab - starting to roll out today . More details in our blog : https : //t.co/qSEb8rnZPB pic.twitter.com/fa1Qtk1oCSMarch 14 , 2019 Along with the new gaming tab in the social media giant 's main app , Facebook also expanded on its plans to release a standalone Facebook Gaming app with additional features . `` We 're also continuing to beta test a standalone Facebook Gaming app on Android , which includes more features than you 'll find in the Facebook Gaming tab , '' said Facebook 's blog post . `` We ’ re getting feedback from the gaming community as we consider further rollout plans . '' At present , the dedicated gaming tab will only be visible to `` a small subset of the more than 700 million people who enjoy gaming on Facebook each month . '' In the meantime , users can find Facebook 's rejuvenated gaming section in the Bookmarks menu .

Almost a day after users began struggling to log in and post to Facebook , WhatsApp and Instagram , the company has given an explanation : a technical error . `` Yesterday , we made a server configuration change that triggered a cascading series of issues , '' a Facebook spokesperson told TechRadar via email . `` As a result , many people had difficulty accessing our apps and services . We have resolved the issues , and our systems have been recovering over the last few hours . We are very sorry for the inconvenience and we appreciate everyone ’ s patience . ” The problems began yesterday ( Wednesday 13 March ) , with nearly all of Facebook 's services , including mobile apps and even the Oculus Store , experiencing partial or full outages . The company was quick to confirm that the problem was n't due to a DDoS attack , but posted no further updates for 22 hours . The company has now shared a post on its official Twitter account confirming that the problem was a technical issue , and is being resolved . Yesterday , as a result of a server configuration change , many people had trouble accessing our apps and services . We 've now resolved the issues and our systems are recovering . We ’ re very sorry for the inconvenience and appreciate everyone ’ s patience.March 14 , 2019
Update : Facebook has confirmed that the outage was due to a technical problem caused by a server configuration change . A spokesperson said that systems are now recovering , and apologized for the inconvenience . Original story follows A day after outages began , some users of Facebook 's family of apps are still unable to use them as normal . Nearly all of Facebook ’ s services , including WhatsApp , Instagram , Facebook Messenger and even the Oculus Store were affected by the problems , which began on Wednesday and have continued into Thursday . Instagram has since announced that its services are now fully restored , but DownDetector 's live outage map shows some parts of Europe still facing issues , and users have reported being unable to post updates and replies . TechRadar reached out to Facebook for a comment , but the company has so far only been able to confirm that it 's working on a solution . `` We ’ re aware that some people are currently having trouble accessing the Facebook family of apps , '' said a Facebook spokesperson . `` We 're focused on working to resolve the issue as soon as possible , but can confirm the issue is not related to a DDoS attack . '' Anyone affected by Facebook ’ s outage was faced with an error message on the login page that reads , “ Facebook is down for required maintenance right now but you should be able to get back on within a few minutes . In the meantime , read more about why you ’ re seeing this message . Thanks for your patience as we improve the site . ” Facebook Messenger , while working perfectly fine for some , was down for others . We checked a few accounts here at TechRadar and found a mixed bag – some were fully functional on both desktop and mobile , while others were either working on desktop only , and some on mobile only . Instagram , too , was not loading for many users around the world , with notifications showing up stating “ something went wrong ” when trying to refresh the feed . The apps aren ’ t completely down for everyone , though . Some users could open the apps but many complained that they were unable to post anything , or even like other people ’ s posts . Although WhatsApp seemed to be working for the most part , many users in India , Bangladesh , Paraguay and Argentina were unable to send photos via the app . WhatsApp is experiencing server issues to send media , for some users . This afflicts Facebook and Instagram too.Let me know if you experience problems ! March 13 , 2019 The Verge reported that some users are unable to make purchases through the Oculus Store or log into multiplayer games purchased for their Oculus headsets . After acknowledging there is an issue , Facebook also made it clear , via Twitter of course , that the company was not facing a DDoS attack . A distributed denial-of-service attack happens when someone is trying to interrupt the regular flow of traffic flowing through a network . This can happen when infrastructure is flooded with a staggering amount of traffic that can bring the system down on its knees . We 're focused on working to resolve the issue as soon as possible , but can confirm that the issue is not related to a DDoS attack.March 13 , 2019 According to Downdetector – the website that shows realtime outages on different kinds of services around the world – the problem does seem widespread with most users facing complete shutdown of services . At one point , 47 % of users were facing a total blackout , but at the time of writing that was down to 32 % . Also at the time of writing , 34 % of users were unable to log into Facebook services , while 33 % were able to open Facebook but had no other functionality available to them .
Facebook has announced that it 's expanding its Watch Party feature to allow users to host viewing parties for live television shows , starting with sporting events . Previously , it was only possible to share online videos , but the new feature is now being tested worldwide in Facebook Groups during events like UEFA Champions League matches . Facebook says that the new Watch Party feature will give sports fans the chance to `` cheer , debate and commiserate on Facebook while watching their favorite match-up . '' Facebook explained how it works in a blog post , saying : `` When you start a Watch Party , you ’ ll see a new option called “ on TV , ” where you can select the live game . '' `` From there , the Watch Party will feature the live game score as you discuss and react in real time alongside other fans . '' According to the blog post , Facebook will also be testing `` interactive tools '' , like `` the ability for hosts to add trivia questions about player stats , or fun facts , and live polls around which team will win . '' If all goes well with these sporting event tests , it sounds as though other types of live TV show could also be broadcasted in Facebook Groups via Watch Party , with Facebook saying that it `` ca n't wait to bring it to all kinds of live events and cultural moments , from awards shows to highly anticipated show premieres and more . '' If there are no restrictions on watching certain events from different territories , the new feature could be a good way to watch sporting events without having to pay for subscription sports channels like BT Sport .

'Dark modes ' are all the rage in 2019 , with seemingly every app and operating system under the sun implementing the battery-saving feature at the moment . Despite its popular Messenger app receiving a dark mode update , it appears that Facebook itself is bucking the trend , with the world 's largest social network currently testing an all-white version of its Android app . First brought to attention by XDA Developers , the refreshed interface drops the iconic ( if somewhat dated ) blue accents that have been synonymous with Facebook since the beginning , replacing them with a much simpler , completely white color scheme . Based on the images above , it 's clear that the social media giant is attempting to apply a singular look to its various apps , bringing Facebook in line with its Messenger app , which has sported an all-white design for quite some time . Alternatively , it could also prove to be Facebook 's first step towards implementing a proper dark mode , as the company 's signature blue would likely clash against an all-black background . At present , the whitened Facebook app is only available through a server-side switch with no word on when it will be available to the general public . There 's also no word on whether the iOS app will receive a similar facelift .

In the most recent Facebook blog post , Mark Zuckerberg has waxed lyrical about his ‘ vision ’ for the mammoth social networking and messaging platform , promising a “ privacy-focused ” future for the service and announcing a number of changes that he intends to eventually implement . According to the post , Zuckerberg has been doing some thinking about the nature of the internet and the increasingly significant role that privacy plays in online interactions . It could be argued that this thinking has been provoked by the privacy breaches and user data-related incidents afflicting Facebook in recent times – it ’ s likely not a coincidence that the one year anniversary of the breaking of the Cambridge Analytica scandal is coming up . Nevertheless , the post mentions the increasing popularity of “ private messaging , ephemeral stories , and small groups ” in online social networks , attributing it to a growing caution of permanent online records , and the desire to connect more immediately with friends , family and relevant groups . As such , Facebook will be looking to build a “ simpler platform that ’ s focused on privacy first ” , and it hopes to achieve this with a similar approach it took to its development of WhatsApp : ” focus on the most fundamental and private use case – messaging – make it as secure as possible , and then build more ways for people to interact on top of that ” . This new approach to a platform will apparently be founded on six core principles : private interactions , encryption , reducing permanence , safety , interoperability , and secure data storage . There seems to be a good deal of overlap in these principles , but some of their descriptions contain more elaborate explanations of what this will change in terms of actual usage . One such promise is to give Messenger and WhatsApp end-to-end encryption and make them “ faster , simpler , more private and more secure ” . This is likely the reason for Facebook having recently moved all of its messaging services to the same platform . While the post acknowledges the delicate balance between keeping private communications truly private , and exposing criminals who use it for nefarious purposes , Zuckerberg ultimately favors encryption , stating that Facebook would “ build appropriate safety systems that stop bad actors as much as it possibly can within the limits of an encrypted service ” . Regarding the issue of permanence , Zuckerberg is considering employing an auto-deletion mechanism for all private messages that would be enabled by default , but could be altered or turned off entirely . Similarly , he proposes a limited timeframe for Facebook to store users ’ message metadata , which is apparently used for “ spam and safety systems ” . As mentioned before , Facebook had already announced its plans to integrate WhatsApp , Instagram and Messenger messaging services , and this blog post confirms that this would then enable encrypted messages to be sent between each of these services . Furthermore , once this capability has been introduced , Facebook is considering allowing each of these services to be able to send and receive messages via SMS as well ( on an opt-in basis ) , although given the nature of SMS messaging , this will not allow for end-to-end encryption and will only work on Android handsets due to Apple ’ s restrictions . In order to ensure it is legally able to uphold the privacy of its users ’ data , Facebook has to consider where it is physically storing such information in its data centers around the globe . “ There 's an important difference between providing a service in a country and storing people 's data there , ” Zuckerberg notes . “ We 've chosen not to build data centers in countries that have a track record of violating human rights like privacy or freedom of expression . ” “ Upholding this principle may mean that our services will get blocked in some countries , or that we wo n't be able to enter others anytime soon , ” he continues . “ That 's a tradeoff we 're willing to make . ” The post concludes by noting that Facebook is in the very early stages for many of these proposed changes , and is still in the process of consulting with experts and officials around the world . Unfortunately , the nature of the blog post is rather vague about what concrete changes will actually take place , let alone when they will occur , so we don ’ t expect anything to significantly shift in the immediate future . Given the broader statements made in this post , we expect Facebook will provide more specific details about changes to its services as and when they are decided upon , developed , and released .

Facebook is bringing a new 'Tributes ' section to user accounts that have become memorial pages - as in , when the user has passed away . Users on Facebook could already set up a 'legacy contact ' for their account , which allows a friend to update their Facebook profile in the event of their passing ( though not actually log in or access private messages ) . Legacy contacts may wish to change profile or cover photos , or `` share a final message on your behalf '' . According to Facebook 's help page , `` Tributes is a space on memorialized profiles where friends and family can share memories of a loved one . '' Rather than simply posting on a friend 's Timeline , users now have a dedicated space for grieving or celebrating , making the act of public mourning more official . Legacy contacts then have direct control over the Tributes posted , allowing them to delete inappropriate posts and decide how public the posts are to friends or the wider world . The feature is currently rolling out to the US , while the UK version of the help page says it 's eventually coming to `` everyone on Facebook '' . It 's easy to read the move as a cynical exploitation of the trauma users experience during the loss of a loved one , in order to increase engagement with the social media platform . However , having a dedicated and controlled space for what you might want to share also sanctions those feelings of grief , and we should n't underestimate the value of a virtual grave to visit . As we increasingly begin and develop working and personal relationships through digital portals , using them to say goodbye could well seem like a natural end as well . Via TechCrunch

For all the privacy concerns and data breaches that have risen around Facebook in recent years , it 's easy to forget the smaller instances of data vulnerability built into the foundation of user profiles . Facebook 's use of user phone numbers came back into the limelight this week , as many users realized that their account was still discoverable by people searching with their phone number . While users can personally restrict this feature - so that they only appear to Friends , or Friends Of Friends - it 's still set to Everyone by default . Facebook has been aggressively courting users to sign up for 2FA ( two-factor authentication ) which requires a linked phone number on the basis of security , though the information is also shared between other Facebook-owned platforms Instagram and WhatsApp , and naturally with advertisers . Twitter user @ jeremyburge posted a damning series of tweets calling out the handling of user data ( below ) , and the whole thread is worth reading : it rightly points out that `` the default action to create a new account is no longer email or username ; it ’ s phone number . The holy grail . The unique ID . '' For years Facebook claimed the adding a phone number for 2FA was only for security . Now it can be searched and there 's no way to disable that . pic.twitter.com/zpYhuwADMSMarch 1 , 2019 The extent to which users no longer have control over their data once handed over is disconcerting , to say the least . While Facebook is finally bringing a 'clear history ' tool to the service later this year , there are foundational pieces of identification data that wo n't be let go of , and which will be increasingly hard to opt out of as Facebook looks to integrate its various social media platforms . And if you 're not regularly keeping up to date with these features - say , through technology news outlets like us - it 's frighteningly hard to address privacy issues you are n't even aware of .

We knew it was coming , but now users can finally access the long-awaited 'dark mode ' in Facebook 's Messenger app for Android and iOS , with the feature arriving as a fun Easter egg for those who follow a few simple steps , as noted on Reddit . Messenger 's dark mode was made available to select users in certain countries late last year as part of the feature 's early testing phase . Now , it 's available to everyone who has the latest version of the app installed on their devices . To unlock dark mode in Messenger , you must first send a message to someone you know ( or even yourself ) that consists solely of a crescent-shaped moon emoji ( the one that looks like this : ☽ ) . Once you 've done that , several moon emoji will rain down over your conversation screen , letting you know that the feature has been unlocked and can be toggled on or off within the app 's settings menu . Some users have reported instances of a pop-up window that will inform you of the new feature , though it appears that it does n't happen for everyone .

Facebook is drawing additional controversy over its Research Program , that collected data on teens through its Onavo VPN app , now that TechCrunch has revealed that the social networking giant misreported the number of users in the program . When the news initially broke , the company said that “ Less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens ” . However , this has been proven to be incorrect thanks to Facebook 's responses to a letter from US Senator Mark Warner on the issue . The senator wrote to CEO Mark Zuckberg about how its Research Program specifically targeted teens and their mobile data usage which it obtained by paying users to install a VPN which spied on them . Facebook 's VP of US public policy Kevin Martin responded to the senator 's questions , saying : “ At the time we ended the Facebook Research App on Apple ’ s iOS platform , less than 5 percent of the people sharing data with us through this program were teens . Analysis shows that number is about 18 percent when you look at the complete lifetime of the program , and also add people who had become inactive and uninstalled the app . ” Basically Facebook provided the media with the percentage of teens in its Research Program when TechCrunch first discovered it as opposed to the total percentage of teens who had been involved throughout the lifespan of the program . The social network faced further scrutiny when Senator Martin grilled them on the issue of parental consent forms . According to Facebook , all participants under 18 signed parental consent forms when first joining the program but in reality the teens who participated just had to check a box to claim that they had parental consent which is quite different from how it first explained the registration process . So to recap , in addition to lying about the nature of its Research Program to begin with , the company also knowingly targeted teens without their parents ' permission . At a time when Facebook is still dealing with the Cambridge Analytica scandal and was recently slammed by the UK government , the company will likely have to address its Research Program formally to show regulators and consumers alike that it should be trusted with user data at all .

It ’ s been over a year since the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit Facebook , and the social media giant is definitely trying to do whatever it can to safeguard user information , announcing a new set of platform policies that developers will need to follow . Under the new changes , frivolous apps like personality quizzes will receive more scrutiny before being allowed to go live on the platform , with Facebook ’ s product management director Eddie O ’ Neil stating that apps like personality quizzes “ may not be permitted on the platform ” . Facebook has also published a list of APIs that will be removed from the platform . New apps will lose access to those APIs on April 30 , while existing apps that utilize those APIs won ’ t be able to access them starting June 30 . If you recall , it was through a quiz app that data firm Cambridge Analytica was able to get their hands on information of over 87 million users without permission . While these apps aren ’ t the problem themselves , the issue then was that Facebook let them collect user information for years without enforcing privacy policies . While Facebook has promised to take a closer look at personality quizzes and the like , the company hasn ’ t elaborated on the criteria it will use to examine these apps . All we know for now is that apps won ’ t be allowed to collect user data if that information “ doesn ’ t enrich in-app experience ” . Moreover , any app that does not use its data access permissions within 90 days will have its privileges revoked . Facebook will also run periodic reviews and audits of apps and , if necessary , remove expired permissions .

It might 've seemed like Facebook got away lightly in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal , with no long-term effects after the initial wave of bad publicity . However , the company expects it will soon have to pay the price for its lapses : a sum between $ 3 billion and $ 5 billion . Facebook has just released its results for the first quarter of 2019 , with a bleak prediction for shareholders . `` In the first quarter of 2019 , we reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded an accrual of $ 3.0 billion in connection with the inquiry of the [ Federal Trade Commission ] into our platform and user data practices , which accrual is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet , '' the company said . `` We estimate that the range of loss in this matter is $ 3.0 billion to $ 5.0 billion . The matter remains unresolved , and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome . '' The fine , whatever it eventually amounts to , is the result of an investigation by the FTC following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018 , which involved the personal data of up to 87 million users being shared without their permission . As Facebook was quick the explain at the time , the scandal was n't a security breach , and none of Facebook 's systems were hacked . Instead , it was the result of a third-party app called thisisyourdigitallife , which took the form of a personality test . It looked benign , but the app also pulled data about their test-taker 's friends on Facebook and sent it to Cambridge Analytica , which was able to use it to target voters with specific messages . This was seriously bad news for Facebook , which had reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 , in which it agreed that third parties would be unable to get their hands on users ' data without those users ' explicit permission . In a statement released on March 26 2018 , the FTC said it `` takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook . Today , the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices . '' As Wired reports , the FTC and Facebook have spent months in negotiations , but there were also rumors that Facebook might fight against the fines . Now , however , it appears to have resigned itself to a sizable bill hitting its mailbox very soon . A fine that size certainly wo n't bankrupt Facebook ( it was possible that it could have been even higher , considering the number of people affected ) , but it 'll certainly be felt . `` The matter remains unresolved , and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome , '' the company said in its report . The final cost is likely to be revealed in the coming months .

Facebook has a long , long record of privacy fails and data scandals , but even by its standards the latest one is a jaw-dropper : the platform has revealed up to 1.5 million Facebook users might have had their email contacts unknowingly uploaded to the site . The process was unintentional – according to Facebook – and happened when users were prompted for their password as part of a security verification process . It 's been going on since May 2016 but Facebook says its now deleting all the scraped data . On top of that , the shoddy password storage techniques used by Facebook that we reported on last month have in fact affected millions of Instagram users – not the `` tens of thousands '' that Facebook initially said . In this case passwords were being stored in plain text , easily visible by Facebook engineers and developers . The passwords were n't leaked outside of Facebook , but the practice should still ring alarm bells – and again , Facebook has promised to fix it . In summary , the plain text password fail of last month affected more Instagram users than we thought , and Facebook has also been uploading our contact lists without permission . Still , Facebook promises to do better in the future , so there 's that to hold on to . And a dark mode feature is rolling out in Facebook Messenger to distract you from all the ways that your data is being improperly handled . At this point it seems Facebook is lurching from one scandal or gaffe to the next , without any real sign of permanently changing its ways . Meanwhile users are switching to other services – though admittedly many of them are also owned by Facebook . Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg seems keenly aware that the social media landscape is changing , and has said the platform will move towards more private sharing in the future . Let 's hope our data stays private too . Via Ars Technica

Facebook is working on its own voice assistant to compete with rivals Siri , Alexa and Google Assistant . According to CNBC , the social media giant has been developing an artificial intelligence-based digital assistant since 2018 , with the project being spearheaded by the team handling the Oculus devices . The project has officially been confirmed by a company spokesperson , who stated that Facebook is `` working to develop voice and AI assistant technologies that may work across [ the company ’ s ] family of AR/VR products including Portal , Oculus and future products '' . Exactly how Facebook plans on integrating the assistant into its products is as yet unclear . Its Portal video chat speakers currently use Amazon ’ s Alexa assistant to power its voice-recognition . This isn ’ t the first time Facebook has tried its hand at an AI assistant . In 2018 , the company canned its chat assistant called M only a year after its launch because users didn ’ t seem to need its help at all . It remains to be seen whether the new Facebook voice assistant takes off or not , but after 2 years of privacy-related scandals , it ’ s likely that its launch will be received with skepticism by many users . Just this month alone , it was revealed that 146GB of Facebook data containing over 540 million user records was exposed on an unsecure server . The company 's Portal smart speaker was also launched soon after the news broke that a Facebook hack had leaked the data of 30 million users . This may be one of the reasons why the devices failed to take off and are currently selling at heavily discounted prices in the US . Whatever the future might hold for the Facebook assistant , it ’ s clear that the company is trying to futureproof its own hardware . It will face stiff competition , with Alexa and Google Assistant already well-established in what is starting to feel like a crowded market .

Social media content is an enormous part of digital marketing – social signals like shares , likes and follows have an important impact on search engine results page ( SERP ) rankings . Engagements like these are beneficial for your SEO , because they indicate to search engines that consumers trust your business . In fact , they ’ re considered by Moz to be one of the top 10 factors that affect search ranking . Facebook has a huge , varied and engaged user base – in December 2018 , they reported 1.52 billion daily active users . It ’ s a place for potential customers to gain an impression of your brand and be redirected to your website to learn more about your services . This article outlines how to optimise the social media platform for great SEO results . Just like your website , your business ’ s Facebook page can also be optimised for keywords . While it doesn ’ t affect your SERP rankings directly , optimising your social media content with keywords has the potential to improve your page ’ s visibility on the platform and help users find it . To optimise your page , make sure to include keywords in your profile and your page name if possible . After you ’ ve chosen one or two of the most high-traffic keywords that are relevant for your business , you should include them throughout your ‘ About us ’ section . Make sure to show restraint and work them in naturally – repetition won ’ t gain you extra visitors , most likely the opposite . Once your page has 25 likes , Facebook will let you choose a custom URL . This means that your page will have its own URL containing the name of your business , which can improve your brand recognition and make you easier to find . Backlinks behave differently on Facebook than they do on your website . Google marks all user-generated links with ‘ no follow ’ tags , which means they aren ’ t considered a ranking SEO factor . However , they can still be useful ; Facebook links can help you increase your site traffic . By sharing links to original content on your website , and embedding them on your profile , you create a logical journey for potential customers . They see your content posted on Facebook , find out more about the company on your business page , and finally click through to your main website or blog . This increases your referral traffic , but also gives you a new base of potential customers that already know a bit about your company by the time they get to your website . With increased visitors coming to your website from Facebook and other social platforms , you can increase your website ’ s visibility . Websites with a variety of inbound and outbound links are more likely to rank higher in search engines . Using this free tool , you can see your active backlinks and identify which ones are performing best . A complete business profile on Facebook functions similarly to a full Google My Business profile : it lets users know who you are , what you offer and where they can find you . However , Facebook gives you a platform to express your brand ’ s personality and have more personal interactions with users . Your Facebook Business Page should include key information like your contact number , address , services or products , working hours and background – this will help you attract new potential followers and customers . Regardless of platform , your business information should always be a part of your wider local SEO strategy . Placing keywords within your description will give you an ideal place to link users who are visiting your page to your website or your blog . Your contact details are important – we might not fully understand how Google and other search engines take social media pages into account for SEO , but many businesses haven ’ t even filled out their social media profiles . Completing a business profile on Facebook will give you an authority boost over competitors that haven ’ t bothered . Customer reviews and interactions with your page are very valuable . They create trust by giving third-party recommendations , something that is very important to online consumers . When users share your content or leave comments and reviews , this offers a chance for you to position your brand as helpful and engaged . You can highlight positive experiences , and any potential negative experiences can be managed before they affect your presence online . Google have gone back and forth about whether social signals affect SERP rankings , but there does seem to be a correlation between ‘ social signals and ranking positions ’ . Facebook gives you an excellent opportunity to build your following and create engagement for free , so make sure you encourage reviews . Running competitions or giveaways can also encourage engagement . You should treat social media as a vital part of your overall SEO strategy – it might not directly affect your ranking on SERP results , but it will certainly contribute to it . Different social media sites have different purposes , and Facebook is an effective tool for engaging with users and customers . In pursuit of a high SERP ranking , make sure you ’ re using Facebook regularly . It ’ s a source of organic impressions that you shouldn ’ t underestimate .

Facebook introduced a dark mode feature to its Messenger app in 2018 but , at the time , it was only being tested by select users in a few countries . In March this year , that feature was opened up to all users , however it was technically still an Easter egg – it had to be sneakily activated by sending a message containing a crescent moon emoji . From today , though , you can say goodnight to the moon as Facebook has announced it ’ s rolling the feature out to all users . Anyone using the Messenger app will be able to darken their chats by heading to the settings pane ( by tapping on the profile picture on the app ) where a ‘ dark mode ’ toggle switch is available right up top . Not only is a dark theme good for your eyes , Google says it also helps conserve battery on Android devices , as it takes less power for the screen to display black . If you don ’ t see the toggle switch right away , try updating the app or waiting a day or two – the feature is rolling out to iOS and Android devices starting from today .

In the wake of the Christchurch attack , Facebook has been under pressure from governments around the globe to do something about how it handles live broadcasts on its platform . One of the biggest proponents asking for restrictions on live streams is the Australian government . Following the attack , a new Australian law has been passed that makes the failure to take down “ abhorrent violent material ” a criminal offense . Facebook is scheduled to meet with a taskforce from the Australian government later this month to discuss the issue , but a report this morning by the Sydney Morning Herald suggests the social media company is already preparing to crack down on live streams on its platform . New restrictions are reportedly set to go live later this month , and will officially be announced after the company meets with the Australian government representatives . In the meantime , though , sources have told the Sydney Morning Herald that any user who has violated Facebook ’ s rules , like spreading hate speech , will be entirely blocked from launching live streams . The company ’ s chief operating officer , Sheryl Sandberg , had previously promised that the social media platform will be taking further steps to address the issue of hate speech . While she was unclear as to what those ‘ steps ’ would entail , a new Facebook policy now specifically bans white nationalist and white separatist content alongside white supremacist posts . Full details on the upcoming restrictions to Facebook live streaming are as yet unknown , but the meeting between the company the Australian government takes place on April 24 , so more will almost certainly come to light after that date . Google , however , has already put policies in place to limit live broadcasts on YouTube . For example , users with less than 1,000 subscribers can no longer livestream when using a mobile device , and only channels with no restrictions in the past 90 days will be able to broadcast video live .

As Facebook prepares to roll all its messaging services together ( including WhatsApp and Instagram ) , it might also turn back the clock and reintegrate Messenger back its its main app . Researcher Jane Manchun Wong spotted the familiar Messenger logo at the top of the main Facebook app . When tapped it revealed a 'Chats ' section , which provided basic messaging functions . So far , the Chats feature does n't allow users to perform more advanced tasks , like reacting to messages , making calls or sending images . Those features might appear in a future update , but Wong says she believes the Messenger app and Chats `` serve different markets '' . Facebook released Messenger as a standalone app in 2011 and removed its features from the main Facebook app in 2014 , but this new move is unlikely to be a case of simply turning back the clock . We 'll be interested to see if conversations from WhatsApp and Instagram will also be accessible in a simplified form through the Chats feature . In January , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ordered developers to rebuild the company 's messaging services `` at their most basic levels '' so that they all work the same way . This would allow messages sent using one service to be read on another , and the Facebook app 's new chat feature would be a handy place to pool them all together in a simplified form .

Facebook 's algorithms may be smart , but they have n't always been tactful when it comes to dealing with the profiles of deceased users – but that could be about to change . In a blog post , chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg announced that Facebook would be making the following updates : `` a new tributes section for memorialized accounts ; additional controls for people who manage memorialized accounts ; and improved AI to keep the profile of a deceased loved one from appearing in painful ways '' . Facebook introduced the ability to memorialize accounts as `` a way for people on Facebook to remember and celebrate those who 've passed away '' , and it allows friends and family to see content the deceased person shared while making it clear that they are no longer alive by adding the word 'Remembering ' in front of their name . The blog post specifically mentioned that Facebook is trying to get `` better and faster '' at stopping memorialized profiles `` showing up in places that might cause distress , like recommending that person be invited to events or sending a birthday reminder to their friends '' . Facebook has also introduced a new 'Tributes ' section to memorialized profiles , `` a separate tab on memorialized profiles where friends and family can share posts — all while preserving the original timeline of their loved one '' . As well as that , legacy contacts – a friend or family member entrusted to look after a user 's Facebook profile after their death – have been given new controls , which allow them to `` moderate the posts shared to the new tributes section by changing tagging settings , removing tags and editing who can post and see posts '' . Sandberg says that this means that legacy contacts can hide `` posts that might be hard for friends and family to see if they ’ re not ready '' from these people specifically . She goes on to say that , while minors ca n't select a legacy contact , Facebook has `` recently changed [ its ] policies to let parents who have lost children under 18 to request to become their legacy contact '' . Facebook has been criticized in the past for not allowing bereaved parents have access to their children 's accounts . In 2015 , Germany 's Federal Court of Justice ruled that the social media company had to grant a mother access to her deceased daughter 's account , in what proved to be a landmark ruling in the subject of the 'digital afterlife ' .

With governments around the globe scrambling to respond to the recent terror attack in Christchurch , pressure has begun to mount for social media platforms to hold more accountability for the content that they host . Australia is one of the first nations to draft new legislation targeting the online platforms , and has today passed a hastily-crafted bill titled 'The Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material ' that aims to specifically curtail the sharing and hosting of violent images and video online . With the new bill in place , it will soon be a criminal offence if these platforms fail to notify the Australian Federal Police about “ violent abhorrent conduct ” found in online videos , and/or fail to remove the offending media in an “ expeditious ” or “ reasonable ” timeframe , according to Australian Attorney General , Christian Porter . Specifically , this conduct is categorised by any media including terrorist acts , murder , attempted murder , torture , rape or kidnapping , and failure to remove or notify of this content is punishable by AU $ 10.5 million or 10 % of a company ’ s annual turnover , or up to three-years imprisonment . As for the ‘ reasonable ’ timeframe , the Attorney General has stated that this would be up to the jury to decide on a case-by-case basis . Although he didn ’ t provide any examples of what this could look like , in regards to the Christchurch tragedy , Porter stated that “ [ E ] very Australian would agree , it was totally unreasonable that it should exist on [ Facebook ] for well over an hour without them taking any action whatsoever ” . In response to the bill – which Porter claims is “ most likely a world first ” – representatives of tech companies such as Google , Facebook and Twitter have warned that the bill is unreasonable in that it penalizes , and potentially imprisons , people working for these tech companies based on content that has been created and shared by the user . Complaints have also been made regarding the vagueness of certain aspects of the bill , such as the aforementioned “ expeditious ” timeframe , or which party would be jailed or fined in the event of a company as large as Facebook contravening the laws . Similar to the anti-encryption bill that the Australian Government passed in December last year , the opposition Labor party has promised to amend this new bill if it gets into power in the country 's upcoming election .

While Facebook may be responsible for securing user data on its own site , what happens when third-party developers fail to do so on their end ? New research from UpGuard has discovered that this was exactly the case regarding two third-party developed Facebook app datasets that have been found exposed to the public internet . The first leak originates from the Mexico-based media company , Cultura Colectiva , which left 146GB of data containing over 540m records unsecured online . The information contained in the dataset includes account names , Facebook IDs , comments , likes , reactions and more which could make it particularly attractive to cybercriminals looking to take over consumer accounts . A Facebook-integrated app called “ At the Pool ” was also found to have exposed a backup of its user data to the public internet via an Amazon S3 bucket . Following its investigation into the leak , UpGuard discovered that this database backup contained a bevy of Facebook user information as well as their passwords . While the Cultura Colectiva dataset may be larger , the At the Pool discovery contains plaintext Facebook passwords for 22,000 users . At the Pool closed its doors back in 2014 and even its parent company 's website is no longer available . This should help assuage the fears of users whose names , passwords , email addresses , Facebook IDs and other details were exposed online for an unknown period of time . Both the Cultura Colectiva and At the Pool datasets were stored in their own Amazon S3 buckets that were configured to allow their contents to be downloaded publicly . UpGuard 's discovery may not gain as much attention as a data breach at Facebook proper but it still shines a light on the problem of mass data collection which the social network notoriously helped popularize .

Bewildered by the content , ads or posts being shown on your Facebook timeline – or just want to know why you see some posts over others ? Facebook is pulling back the veil on the algorithm powering its Newsfeed , making it easier for users to see how content is being tailored to them . In a post on Facebook 's Newsroom blog , the social media giant detailed some of the new information users could learn about posts on their personal Newsfeed – whether they liked a certain page , shared a certain article , or became friends with a specific Facebook user . By clicking on the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner of any post , users can access the info , as well as be prompted to take action off the back of what they learn : unfollow a certain page , alter their preferences , or clarify that they do n't want to keep seeing posts on a certain topic . The move is effectively an expansion of Facebook 's existing 'Why am I seeing this ad ? ' feature , which shows what previous actions or demographic information ( age , interests , etc ) had led to you being showed particular sponsored content – but will now include posts from friends or the pages you follow as well as advertisements . The feature has launched in the US , while a source close to Facebook said it would be rolled out globally by May . Privacy is a hot topic in the world of social media , especially with regards to Facebook . The past year has seen some high profile data breaches , as well as a growing distrust of how social media companies handle user information . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has even been pulled in front of Congress to explain some of the site 's dubious practices – and users are increasingly concerned over how and why certain content is tailored to them . In a video posted on the blog , a Facebook spokesperson assures us that we can `` take more control of that content in the future [ and ] help you customize what you see on your screen . '' This show of transparency may be just that – a show – but in the short term at least users will have the chance to better understand what Facebook knows about them , and whether they want to do anything about it .

An initiative called the Christchurch Call , led by the governments of New Zealand and France , calls on other world leaders and tech giants to be more vigilant in policing live streams on social media platforms . While the United States government has refused to endorse the effort , Facebook has agreed to make some minor changes to the way it polices its platform . Two months after the horrific mass shootings at two Christchurch mosques that left 50 people dead , Facebook has imposed what it calls a “ one strike policy ” that will determine who can use its live-streaming service . According to the announcement made on its blog , the social media giant will ban any user who has broken its rules from using Facebook Live for a set period of time . “ From now on , anyone who violates our most serious policies will be restricted from using Live for set periods of time – for example 30 days – starting on their first offense . For instance , someone who shares a link to a statement from a terrorist group with no context will now be immediately blocked from using Live for a set period of time , ” explains Facebook ’ s vice president of integrity Guy Rosen . While the same restrictions apply to Facebook ’ s Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy – a new stratagem the company used to ban right-wing personalities like Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos from both Facebook and Instagram earlier this month – the social media giant hasn ’ t specified the exact duration of the ban period nor has it explained which rules will have to be broken to prompt a permanent ban . The restrictions , Rosen says , will be extended to other parts of the platform “ in the coming weeks ” , like barring users who have violated Facebook ’ s Community Standards from taking out ads on the platform . Facebook ’ s use of artificial intelligence to detect and flag dangerous content on its platform has proven insufficient and , to boost efforts , Rosen said the company will be investing around $ 7.5 million in research to “ improve image and video analysis technology ” .

A year after banning all blockchain-related ads , Facebook has decided to relax its rules and allow ads for “ blockchain technology , industry news , education or events related to cryptocurrency ” without the need for pre-approval by the social networking giant . The social media site still wo n't allow users to advertise for ICOs and ads for cryptocurrencies and exchanges will still need prior approval but the move could lead to renewed interest in blockchain technology . Following last year 's cyrptocurrency boom and eventual decline , the industry has struggled to regain the public attention it once had with blockchain events being hit especially hard as Facebook 's local and interest targeting capabilities made the social network an ideal place to sell tickets to potential attendees . Facebook 's decision to ban ads about blockchain came out of an interest to protect its users from Initial Coin Offerings and other cryptocurrency deals at the height of the boom . Users began to see ads for blockchain education this week and other related ads will soon make their way into their news feeds soon . While Facebook has relaxed its policies on blockchain ads , it will soon ban ads for contracts for difference ( CFDs ) beginning on June 5th as they are often associated with predatory behavior . News of the social media giant 's own blockchain efforts surfaced this week with a report from Bloomberg that revealed that its own blockchain group now has over 50 employees , many of which joined the company from PayPal . Apparently the group is developing a stablecoin which will be pegged to a bundle of currencies Facebook is attempting to raise from outside investors with the aim of keeping the price of its cryptocurrency stable . Greater interest in blockchain could be beneficial to society as a whole as both large and small businesses are looking for new ways to utilize the technology for payments , real estate transactions and more .

In an age where a small number of tech giants own huge swathes of social media and digital services ( Google , Apple , Facebook , and the like ) , even a single conference event from one such company can have wide repercussions for the way we consume media day to day . This week we were treated to Facebook ’ s annual F8 conference in California , which had a flurry of announcements for the coming year , covering everything from app redesigns to VR headset releases . We ’ ve run through everything from the conference that looks set to shape the industry – or , at least , Facebook ’ s share of it – in the year ahead . Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift S coming in May The social media giant has bet big on VR as the next big computing platform , and Oculus ’ s range of VR headsets is how Facebook plans to do that . The standalone Oculus Quest headset ( with built-in movement tracking ) and PC-tethered Oculus Rift S will both be landing on May 21 , both for the price of $ 399 / £399 ( around AU $ 730 ) . Both are also available now for pre-order and will be replacing the previous Oculus Rift model . Messenger getting desktop apps Facebook ’ s Messenger app will be getting dedicated desktop apps for PC and Mac . They ’ ll be based on the smartphone apps for the chat service , and will incorporate Messenger dark mode . The Messenger app is also being rewritten from the ground up – partially to reduce its size to below 30MB and speed up in-app processes , but also to pave the way for its integration with Instagram and WhatsApp ’ s chat services . Messenger gets end-to-end encryption Worried about your data privacy ? Facebook doesn ’ t have the best reputation for handling sensitive data – despite having a lot of it – but encryption for Messenger will make your gifs and threads that little bit safer from prying eyes . Facebook app gets a reskin The mainline Facebook app is getting a redesign , from a rejigged logo to a heavier emphasis on Facebook Groups . The so-called FB5 update will also bring some tweaks to comment reacts to make that angry face all the more , well , angry . Facebook Portal comes to Europe and Canada , with a host of new features Facebook ’ s take on a smart display , the Portal and Portal Plus , are rolling out beyond the US after not selling as badly as everyone expected . An upcoming update will bring in support for Facebook Live ( for sharing live video ) and Instagram feeds , to make the device more compatible with smartphone applications – as well as support for WhatsApp calls . Facebook Dating wants you to hit on your friends In case you wanted to Facebook to know your sexual preference too , the Facebook dating service is still live and rolling out to more countries over the coming months ( 15 , up from five ) . A new feature called `` Secret Crush '' will also allow you to name nine of your friends you have an interest in , and see if they return the compliment . Instagram wants you to buy more , stress less The other social media platform owned by Facebook was also present at the conference , announcing changes to make it easier than ever to immediately buy something an influencer is wearing in your Instagram feed . There will be some changes to the Instagram interface , allowing for more in-app content creation tools ( though the details are currently vague ) , while the platform is also toying with the idea of hiding the number of likes user posts get – to try and reduce the sense of competition between impressionable users . A number of app tweaks and wider service rollouts may not seem like drastic stuff , but together they mark some key trends in how Facebook is affecting our communication systems . There 's a notable push towards user privacy , which has been a contentious topic over the past year or so – with Facebook being hit by a massive $ 5bn fine for its mishandling of user data . And the platform will need to keep making good on its privacy promises to maintain users increasingly tired of being apologised to . The likes of Facebook and Instagram already have a hold on our attention – and their move towards more private messages and encryption , and an awareness of the toll constant exposure can have on their users ' well-being , hopefully shows a social media landscape starting to mature .
Facebook has announced major changes to the social networking platform , and updates are also coming to the Facebook Messenger app and WhatsApp , with Facebook aiming to overhaul the former while enhancing the latter . Last year , Facebook showed off Messenger 4 , and since then it 's added dark mode , the ability to unsend messages , augmented reality features and more . Now , Facebook is aiming for major changes to the platform . After considerable backlash within the past two years over Facebook 's handling of sensitive personal data , the company is , not surprisingly , making a large push in the area of privacy , with many of the announcements at its annual F8 keynote this year emphasizing this . For Messenger , this comes in the form of end-to-end encryption by default for communications , including not just text but also shared locations , video communications and more . This is a long-awaited feature for the popular platform , and will ensure that communications between users are protected from outside eyes , whether they be hackers , governments or Facebook itself . Beyond the enhancements to security , Facebook is planning to make the app dramatically better over the course of the year . The company is completely rewriting the app 's codebase to reduce the app size below 30MB and offer faster launching of the app , all without reducing the features offered . These improvements can also reduce the app 's battery usage on smartphones . Facebook has further plans to make Messenger the fastest communication app on the planet , and wants to improve reliability . So , more people will be able to use the app with high-end and low-end devices alike . Another effort to simplify use for everyone is a push toward interoperability . So , going forward , Messenger users will be able to communicate with WhatsApp and Instagram users directly within the Messenger app . And , Facebook 's Messenger platform is getting a dedicated app for Windows and Mac computers with all the features of the mobile versions , including dark mode . WhatsApp is also getting some changes . Facebook is introducing the ability to share stories and locations similar to Messenger , and they 'll keep the same end-to-end encryption that has been a key aspect of WhatsApp . WhatsApp is also coming to Portal , Facebook 's smart display , so both Messenger and WhatsApp will be available on the device with end-to-end encryption for video chats .
After a brutal 2018 that forced Facebook to admit it has n't got the best reputation when it comes to privacy , Mark Zuckerberg has big plans for the social networking platform in 2019 : Facebook is being redesigned . Zuckerberg made the announcements during Facebook 's F8 event near the company 's home turf in San Jose , California , where he addressed the past year of issues concerning privacy , security and decreasing trust in the platform . The new version of Facebook , codenamed 'FB5 ' , will be the biggest change the social network has experienced in years : almost every single aspect of the platform is changing in some way . There 's a lot of information to process , and we 've wrapped up everything you need to know right here . Read more : The fifth major redesign of Facebook is incoming , codenamed 'FB5 ' , and it will make communities – known as Groups – the focus , featuring a sleek redesign that should make it faster and more reliable , not to mention more visually appealing . The new Facebook mobile app should now be live too , as a much faster and more immersive experience . Facebook has made finding what you 're looking for more convenient , and more importantly claims to have made it safer and more secure . This is the biggest change to the Facebook app in five years – even the Facebook logo is being updated for 2019 . There 's a new Facebook desktop website , too , and it should be much lighter on system resources , with the same design language as the mobile app . It will be coming in the next few months , with some updates showing up right away . Zuckerberg made it clear that Facebook 's focus is shifting to communities both public and private . This means that Groups are going to be the core focus : there are already tens of millions of active Groups on Facebook . Groups will be easier to find , and easier to participate in , thanks to a new , redesigned Groups tab . This will show you a personalized feed of all of your groups , so you can focus on your communities in a single place , rather than parsing them out from the rest of your News Feed . Users will also notice that Group recommendations will crop up in more places , but they 'll be more relevant to what you 're doing in the app . For instance , you may see more 'buy and sell ' groups show up in the Marketplace , and Today in Gaming may suggest a new gaming group for you to join . The News Feed will also be redesigned so that you can more easily share content directly to your Groups ; but this new community approach goes beyond Groups . Facebook is launching Facebook Dating in more countries , along with a new feature called Secret Crush . The idea is that you can opt in to this , and name up to nine of your friends who you have interest in . If any of those friends opt in to the program and name you as one of their secret crushes , then you 'll be matched ; if the secret crush is n't mutual , no one will know the names you entered . Facebook Dating was already live in five countries , and has now been expanded to 14 more . The service will launch in the US at the end of the year . There will also be some new ways to meet friends , through the new Meet New Friends feature . This is also an opt-in feature , so you 'll only be exposed to people who are open to meeting new people . This feature will also work with your Groups , so you can easily add new friends from your favorite community . Facebook 's Marketplace is also getting some improvements – in the US you 'll be able to ship products across the country rather than just locally , and users will be able to pay for stuff safely and securely through the Facebook app . This should make shopping on the Facebook platform more secure for both sellers and buyers . The Events tab is also getting a makeover , and it 'll be easier to explore your city . You can coordinate with your friends , find local businesses , and find a new favorite restaurant based on your own personal preferences . There are many Facebook changes coming in the next few months , and it could transform the way people use the platform day-in and day-out – and at the very least , the hope is that these changes will make the social network more secure , and less divisive .

Researchers at the University of Oxford have been making some macabre calculations , and have concluded that the number of dead Facebook users will outnumber the living sometime between 2070 and 2100 . In one scenario , the team from Oxford Internet Institute predicted what would happen if Facebook gained no new users at all from the time the paper was written . If this happened , it would take about 50 years for the balance to tip and the deceased to have a majority . At the other end of the scale , if the site 's tally of registered users continue to increase by 13 % per year , the balance would tip at around 2100 , by which time 4.9 billion of account holders would have shuffled off this mortal coil . The paper 's authors state that the actual year will almost certainly sit somwhere between those two dates , but it 's impossible to say exactly when . The bleak news follows an announcement from Facebook that it will be more tactful about its deceased users in future , introducing a new Tributes section for accounts that have been 'memorialized ' and taking steps to make sure people are n't tactlessly asked to wish deceased acquaintances a happy birthday . A memorialized account lets friends and family see posts the deceased user shared on the site , but adds the word 'remembering ' to their profile to make it clear that they are no longer alive . The Tributes tab will be a space for messages remembering the person , which can be moderated by a nominated friend or family member .
The Facebook Portal was launched back in 2018 , in the wake of a host of privacy scandals rocking the company . It seemed a curious time to ask consumers to invite Facebook 's smart displays into their living room , with a focus on video calls making 'spy camera ' jibes all too easy . One year later , the Portal is still around , and – despite a less-than-reassuring earnings report for 2019 – apparently selling enough units for Facebook to roll out the hardware outside the US . The Portal and Portal Plus smart displays will be coming to Canada and across Europe , showing an extended shelf life for what could have been a very short-lived product . Facebook made the announcement at its F8 developer conference in San Jose , California , alongside news of a Facebook app redesign and a wider rollout of Facebook Dating ( coming to nine more countries ) . We also got a closer look at Facebook 's plans for integrating the Portal with other Facebook-owned services . The Portal range will soon support WhatsApp calls , and therefore end-to-end WhatsApp encryption , which may go some way to allaying fears over user privacy . Portal owners will also be able to share images from their Instagram feeds , and footage from Facebook Live , making the most of the Portal 's smartphone-shaped display . Facebook has made no secret of its plans to integrate its chat services for Messenger , Instagram and WhatsApp down the line – and it seems like the company 's first smart home product will be a test ground for those services playing nice with each other .

Facebook is testing a new feature that will let you share your WhatsApp status directly to Facebook and Instagram with a tap of a button . The feature is being rolled out right now , so if you 're interested , you can join the beta program for Android or iOS and take it for a spin . Testers must choose to share each status update individually – there 's no option to have all statuses sent to other apps automatically , which should hopefully help avoid embarrassing over-sharing . In January , Facebook announced that it would be bringing all its apps closer together , with CEO Mark Zuckerberg ordering developers to rebuild Facebook Messenger , Instagram and WhatsApp `` at their most basic levels '' . To the relief of many , the announcement scotched rumors that the three services would be rolled into one monster social network – a place where selfie-strewn Instagram accounts would sit awkwardly alongside family messaging groups , and data entered in one app would be shared universally . Instead , his comments suggested that the best features from each app ( such as WhatsApp 's end-to-end encryption ) could be shared with the rest , improving them all while keeping them separate . In a statement to The Verge , WhatsApp confirmed that this change – which means all of Facebook 's apps now use the same data-sharing APIs – was what made the new sharing function possible . Interestingly , it seems that you 'll also be able share your current mood over some non-Facebook channels , such as Gmail and Google Photos , though as these are n't primarily social networking apps , we 're uncertain how popular these options will be .

It 's one of Facebook 's techniques for grabbing your attention and keeping you glued to its mobile app – red notification alerts that appear over the Friends , Groups and Marketplace tabs . They can be deeply annoying , especially when there 's no clear reason for them appearing , but now it looks like Facebook might provide us with a way to turn them off . App specialist Jane Machun Wong discovered a series of switches in the app 's settings that will let you disable dots for Groups , Marketplace , Profile and Menu . TechCrunch has since received confirmation that the new toggles are being tested publicly , and are available to a handful of users on iOS and Android . This new change may be part of Facebook 's stated aim to ensure that time surfing the site is `` time well spent '' . Last year , the company introduced a new feature called Your Time on Facebook , which lets you see how long you 're spending each day scrolling through the endless photos of family birthdays and dog videos on your timeline . Hopefully the ability to disable the dots will have a similar effect , making the app feel less demanding and helping users ( particularly kids ) know when it 's time to log off . Via TechCrunch

Internet bots are a touchy subject these days , especially when it comes to social media . How many of that celebrity 's Twitter followers are real people , and how many are fake ? Who in the comments section of that Facebook post has a genuine opinion to share , and who is just trying to send a debate into disarray ? The answer is n't always clear – and according to Facebook 's head of cybersecurity policy , Nathaniel Gleicher , it 's that uncertainty that 's likely to cause trouble in the coming years . Gleicher spoke on the subject of online security at the 360/OS conference in London , saying that organizations attempting to destabilize online debate – and influence the outcome of political elections – would no longer have to conceal their efforts to be successful . At this point , with the public eye so squarely aimed at potential meddling , drawing attention to bad actors ' own methods was likely to spread fear and distrust across online platforms . According to Gleicher , that means “ Not running a large network of fake accounts , but just playing on the fact that everyone thinks there are large networks of fake accounts out there '' ( quotes via The Guardian ) . He cites an example of the US midterms elections in 2018 , when someone claiming to be part of the IRA ( Russia 's Internet Research Agency ) published a propaganda website to cause suspicion of outside interference . The website stated that `` We control public debate in the US and we ’ ve decided who ’ s going to win and who ’ s going to lose '' – with examples of the supposedly thousands of Instagram accounts they controlled . “ This technique , of preying on everyone ’ s fears , we expect to see a lot more of , '' says Gleicher . `` It ’ s an interestingly challenging problem to deal with , because they ’ re forcing you to prove a negative . They ’ re forcing all of us to prove a negative . Prove that there wasn ’ t manipulation . Which is incredibly challenging . ” Issues of cybersecurity have continued to plague Facebook in the past few years . The Cambridge Analytica scandal left many social media users wary of the data they share online , and prompted a huge amount of debate around the way that our opinions can be shaped or influenced by the content shown to them by Facebook 's algorithms . The social media giant has taken steps to allay fears of its site being hijacked by outside interests – Russia-linked election ads being a prime example – such as including more transparent ads and implementing a more thorough vetting process for advertisers . It 's unclear Facebook – and other social media platforms like it – can fully protect its users from those wishing to game the systems in place . But even if they do , our own distrust of the people , platforms and voices we find online may prevent us from believing it . Via The Guardian

Zero-day flaws which impact two of Facebook 's official WordPress plugins have been disclosed by a US-based cybersecurity firm including proof-of-concept ( PoC ) code that could be used by hackers to exploit the flaws and launch attacks against WordPress sites . The affected plugins include Messenger Customer Chat which shows a custom Messenger chat window on WordPress sites and Facebook for WooCommerce that allows WordPress site owners to upload their WooCommerce-based stores on their Facebook pages . The Messenger Customer Chat plugin is installed on over 20,000 sites while the Facebook for WooCommerce plugin has 200,000 users after the WordPress team began shipping the plugin as part of the official WooCommerce online store plugin back in April . Since that time , the plugin has received a rating of 1.5 stars with reviewers complaining about errors and a lack of updates . The flaws in these two plugins became much more dangerous when the cybersecurity firm Plugin Vulnerabilities decided to publicly expose them on the WordPress.org forums . The firm and WordPress have been feuding for years after a policy change banned users from disclosing security flaws through its forums and instead required security researchers to email the WordPress team who would then contact the owners of any affected plugins . However , Plugin Vulnerabilities has continued to disclose security flaws on the WordPress forums despite the new rule which resulted in it having its forum accounts banned . The firm took things a step further this spring when it also began to publish blog posts on its site with in-depth details and PoC code about the vulnerabilities it had discovered . The two zero-day flaws Plugin Vulnerabilities discovered in Facebook 's WordPress plugins are n't as dangerous as those it has revealed in the past as they require social engineering to get a user to click on a malicious link . Although the flaws are harder to exploit , they could allow attackers to take over WordPress sites . Security researchers are generally doing a company a favor when they discover vulnerabilities but by not going through the proper channels to report the vulnerabilities it discovered , the US cybersecurity firm put everyone who has those plugins installed at risk .

Facebook has finally taken the wraps off its long-awaited cryptocurrency . The social media giant has revealed that it will be launching the new Libra cryptocurrency as part of its blockchain-powered Calibra digital wallet , coming to Messenger and WhatsApp in 2020 . Facebook says you 'll be able to send Libra to `` almost anyone with a smartphone '' quickly and easily , and at a low cost - and the new cryptocurrency can be used for anything from paying for a coffee to riding public transport . Rumours surrounding a Facebook cryptocurrency have been swirling around for some time , and the company finally revealed more details in a blog post today . Although fairly sparse on exact details , Facebook says that Calibra can help those in developing countries where even the most basic financial services are out of reach , quoting recent research that says almost half of the adults in the world don ’ t have an active bank account . `` This is the challenge we ’ re hoping to address with Calibra , a new digital wallet that you ’ ll be able to use to save , send and spend Libra , '' the company says . Calibra has already signed up a decent posse of backers , with Mastercard , PayPal , Spotify and Uber among those pledging their support . Facebook says that Calibra will use verification and anti-fraud processes similar to those currently being used by banks and credit card providers , including automated systems that will monitor your usage to flag any potentially fraudulent behavior . Calibra will also come with dedicated live support if you lose your phone or forget your password , with Facebook also promising refunds if your account is compromised . Crucially , the company says that Calibra will run as a completely separate subsidiary of Facebook , and wo n't share account information or financial data with Facebook or any third party without getting the user 's consent . There 's no concrete info on an exact release date yet , but Facebook is promising to reveal more soon .

Facebook is taking more steps to try and limit negative comments and abuse on its platform , introducing an improved ranking system for comments on public profiles that will hopefully lead to more `` meaningful conversations '' . Public comments on busy pages ( like those for a celebrity for instance ) are already ranked to some extent , using considerations like how many interactions a comment gets and various other `` integrity signals '' . Now Facebook says it 's also going to take into account whether owners of pages and their network of friends have interacted with a comment . So if your post on Cristiano Ronaldo 's Facebook page does n't get a response from the great man himself , it might not show up quite as prominently . The new rankings system will continue to use multiple considerations for ranking comments , and as usual , Facebook is going to keep some of its cards close to its chest to stop people gaming the system . These ranking adjustments are part of a much bigger overhaul for Facebook that was announced last month , with changes happening across all of the platform 's various apps and services . Groups and private conversations are being given more prominence in the new design , while the more traditional ways of sharing and the News Feed take a back seat . Facebook Dating is getting rolled out across more countries , while a new feature called Meet New Friends helps you do exactly that – expand your network of buddies based on shared communities and interests . The changes to comment rankings on public pages are rolling out now , so you should see them in effect straight away , unless you 've already moved all your social networking into private group chats .

If you 've been uncertain about whether Facebook is studying your every move , and what it knows about you , there 's a new way to be sure – by telling Facebook everything , and getting some sweet , sweet cash in exchange . Facebook Study is a new app from the company , announced in a post in its newsroom , that tracks every single thing you do on your phone , and then pays you for it . In the post , Facebook announced its new focus on `` reward-based market research programs '' , of which Study is the first – take note of the plural , implying there will be more in the future . `` Market research program '' is a glorified way of saying 'app that steals your data ' or 'approved malware ' , but we 're not sure those phrases would look good in a press release . Not everyone can sign up to the system – Facebook is running ads for the program , and if you see one you can register with your information , after which Facebook will choose which applicants are eligible to download the app . If you 've got the app downloaded , Facebook will monitor which apps you have installed on your phone , how long you spend on each one , what you 're doing in the apps , and where you 're based . Facebook has n't announced any kind of compensation plan , so we do n't know if you 'll be raking in lots of money with Study , or if it 'll just let you get an extra cup of coffee each month , and it 's pretty important to know this so you can put a monetary value on your privacy . The app is only available in the US and India currently , but we 'd be very surprised if the company does n't release it everyone else – personal data is personal data after all , and Facebook is hungry for as much as it can get .

Despite skepticism around the first generation of Facebook Portal devices , which are designed to allow video chat between you and your online pals , the social media behemoth is already planning a second generation of the devices . Facebook 's vice president of augmented and virtual reality Andrew Bosworth announced the next-gen video chat devices at the Code Conference in Phoenix , Arizona . At the launch of the first generation of Portal devices , Facebook promised that they would n't listen to or record calls , but it later explained that things were n't quite that clear-cut . `` Portal voice calling is built on the Messenger infrastructure , so when you make a video call on Portal , we collect the same types of information ( ie usage data such as length of calls , frequency of calls ) that we collect on other Messenger-enabled devices , '' it said . `` We may use this information to inform the ads we show you across our platforms . Other general usage data , such as aggregate usage of apps , etc , may also feed into the information that we use to serve ads . '' At an event in Phoenix , Arizona , Bosworth explained that the next-gen Portals will feature `` new form factors '' , but kept the exact details close to his chest . Bosworth was also careful to steer the conversation away from privacy concerns , saying that Facebook is aiming `` to make sure that human connection , connection between two people , is a first-party experience '' . You 'll be able to decide whether that 's an experience you want to invite into your home when the devices launch in a few months ' time . Via Engadget

Huawei devices will no longer ship with Facebook applications pre-installed in the latest blow for the beleaguered Chinese smartphone vendor . Reuters says the development affects not only Facebook ’ s core social networking app , but also other services such as Instagram and WhatsApp . Existing users will be able to access the applications and receive updates , however , while it will also still be possible to manually download the apps from the Google Play store . Although the inability to pre-load Facebook apps is not as serious as a lack of Android updates or access to components , it does demonstrate the scale of the challenge presented to Huawei by the US government . It also demonstrates the different interpretations of the ruling . Whereas Google will continue to provide updates to existing Huawei smartphone models – even ones that haven ’ t been built yet – Facebook apps are affected immediately . Last month , US firms were ordered to stop doing business with the company , a decision which means future handsets may no longer receive updates for Google 's Android operating system or access its popular applications . The US government ’ s actions also make it significantly harder for Huawei to source components for its devices , with British-based chip designer ARM ceasing work on existing contracts with the company . Huawei ’ s issues in the smartphone market stem from its networking business . Huawei has long been effectively been frozen out of the US telecoms market due to fears that its equipment is a national security risk , allegations that it has continually denied . The US has never produced any proof to support its claims but is urging its allies to follow its lead – an approach which has led to mixed results . Via Reuters

Public interest in cryptocurrency could be set for a rebound as social media giant Facebook is planning to announce its own digital coin later this month according to a new report from The Information . Last year , the company appointed former PayPal executive David Marcus to start exploring possible opportunities with blockchain and this led to speculation that it could be developing its own cryptocurrency for use on its platform . Anticipation has grown since then and several media outlets have reported that Facebook is indeed building its own digital currency called GlobalCoin which consumers would be able to store , trade and exchange for regular currency through WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger . Surprisingly , The Information 's report also revealed that the company is planning to release physical machines similar to ATMs where users can buy its cryptocurrency in person . Facebook has repeatedly faced pressure from privacy advocates and lawmakers over its advertising business which is why launching its own cryptocurrency could make sense as way to diversify its revenue streams . A digital coin would also be an easy way for Facebook 's 2bn users to pay for items on its Marketplace and exchange money between countries at a much lower price or perhaps even for free . During this year 's F8 developer conference , CEO Mark Zuckerberg also made a point to highlight how important of an area payments is to the company . According to the report , Facebook has even begun to solicit third-party organizations to act as nodes that will help manage its cryptocurrency . However , this privilege comes at a steep price and the company has discussed charging each node organization $ 10m . Cryptocurrency nodes are utilized to resolve the complicated mathematical equations needed to validate transactions and while they are typically decentralized , Facebook is planning to create a foundation with named partners to help manage its new digital coin offering .

It began with a simple question : “ So , what if you could type directly from your brain ? ” That was something Facebook ’ s CEO Mark Zuckerburg asked on stage during the company ’ s annual F8 conference back in 2017 . Since then , Facebook has been funding research into a brain-computer interface ( BCI ) that it could use in augmented reality wearables , like its long-talked about AR glasses . Looks like the mind-reading interface could be one step closer to reality with Facebook releasing the first significant update on the project , with researchers now able to “ decode a small set of full , spoken words and phrases from activity in real time ” . This breakthrough , published in the journal Nature Communications , came about via an algorithm that was able to read the thoughts of participants suffering from brain injuries . When the project was first announced in 2017 , the goal was to “ decode silent speech ” . In this experiment , scientists at the University of California , San Francisco – backed by Facebook Reality Labs – were allowed to implant electrodes into the brains of three epilepsy patients . The participants were asked questions which they needed to answer aloud . This helped them identify activity and patterns in parts of the brain associated with understanding and producing speech in real time . The readings from the electrodes , according to the researchers , were accurate 61 % of the time , demonstrating it is possible to decode speech “ in an interactive , conversational setting ” to help people suffering from brain trauma to communicate . Today we ’ re sharing an update on our work to build a non-invasive wearable device that lets people type just by imagining what they want to say . Our progress shows real potential in how future inputs and interactions with AR glasses could one day look . https : //t.co/ilk192GwARJuly 30 , 2019 Facebook , however , is willing to be patient as the research progresses to where “ real-time decoding speed of 100 words per minute with a 1,000-word vocabulary and word error rate of less than 17 percent ” becomes possible… even if it takes a decade . In the meantime , the company is working on a “ portable , wearable device made from consumer-grade parts ” that monitors oxygen levels in the brain . This , the social media giant claims , could be a way for a BCI device to read people ’ s minds without the need for invasive surgery . The device is “ currently bulky , slow and reliable ” but , if or when perfected , could be used as a basis of Facebook ’ s AR glasses , allowing us – at some point in the future – to communicate without the need for smartphones .

Companies that use embedded Facebook 'Like ' buttons will now be held responsible for the data collected and sent to the US-based social network , an EU court has ruled . Online retail businesses often use website plugins to help promote their products on social networks but critics are concerned that the data transfer could breach EU privacy laws . The Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union ( ECJ ) came to its ruling after a German consumer body sued the German online fashion retailer Fashion ID for breaching personal data protection rules by using Facebook 's 'Like ' button on its site . A German court sought guidance on the case and ECJ judges said that websites and Facebook share joint responsibility . According to EU data privacy rules , a data controller determines why personal data must be collected and how it is processed . A data processor on the other hand only processes personal data on behalf of the controller and is often a third-party company . The ECJ judges found that , in the case of embedding Facebook 's 'Like ' button , both the website and Facebook are responsible , saying : “ The operator of a website that features a Facebook ‘ Like ’ button can be a controller jointly with Facebook in respect of the collection and transmission to Facebook of the personal data of visitors to its website . ” German retailer Fashion ID gained a commercial advantage from the 'Like ' button as it made its products more visible on Facebook according to the court which also said that the company is not liable for how the data is processed by Facebook . Facebook 's associate general counsel , Jack Gilbert responded to the ruling in a statement , saying : “ We are carefully reviewing the court ’ s decision and will work closely with our partners to ensure they can continue to benefit from our social plugins and other business tools in full compliance with the law . ” Via Reuters

Facebook and Instagram are cracking down hard on alcohol and tobacco , preventing private sales and imposing limits on brands on their respective platforms . Both platforms are banning individual users from selling , trading or giving away any products , while alcohol and tobacco brands will have to mark their content as suitable for those over 18 years old , according to CNN . Facebook is currently contacting admins of groups dedicated to selling and trading the newly restricted products , and any that do n't comply with the updated rules will be deleted . Such sales are already banned on Facebook Marketplace . Last month , the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) sent warning letters to four e-cigarette companies that paid social media influencers on Facebook and Instagram to promote their products . Influencers are n't affected by the new rules and wo n't need to age-restrict posts about vaping , but a Facebook spokesperson told CNN that influencer policies might change in the future . So where else can you sell your grandpa 's single malt ? It 's technically possible to sell alcohol on eBay , but you 'll need special permission in advance . In the US , eBay only allows the sale of wine – not hard liquor like whiskey , You can sell alcohol on Amazon Marketplace in the UK ( including hard liquor ) , provided you can make sure the buyer is 18 or older . US sellers can only list wine on Amazon , and again , only if they 're pre-approved . Your best route is probably a specialty broker , who can make sure all the necessary laws are followed . They 'll also be able to value your vintage bottles properly , and you can be assured your bottles are going to a good home . Via CNN

Facebook has been hit with a record $ 5bn fine by the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to settle privacy concerns over the Cambridge Analytica data-stealing scandal . The social network will also be required to establish an independent privacy committee that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will have no control over . The FTC began its probe into Facebook in regard to how the political consultancy Cambridge Analtyica improperly obtained the data of up to 87m of the site 's users but the probe was later widened to include other issues such as facial recognition . FTC chairman Joe Simons explained why the agency levied the largest fine ever imposed on any company for violating consumer privacy in a statement , saying : `` Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared , Facebook undermined consumers ' choices . ” Simons also explained that the record fine was designed “ to change Facebook 's entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations . ” The FTC 's Bureau of Consumer Protection first began investigating Facebook back in March 2018 when the news broke that an online personality quiz was used to illegally harvest user data and sold to Cambridge Analytica . There were also claims that this data may have been used to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum . Despite the fact that only 270,000 users took the quiz , whistleblower Christoper Wylie claims that the data of around 50m users was harvested through the friend networks of those who took it . Back in October of last year , the UK 's data protection watchdog fined Facebook £500,000 for its role in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal . The FTC 's investigation found that some of the social network 's policies violated rules against deceptive practices such as how its data policy was deceptive to those who used its facial recognition tool or how it did not reveal that phone numbers used for two-factor authentication would be used for advertising . FTC representatives from both the Democrat and Republican parties voted the settlement deal through , though some believed the penalty against Facebook was too lenient . Via The BBC
Online scammers are launching fake Facebook Libra sales pages to try and scam Facebook users into buying fake cryptocurrency . An investigation by The Washington Post has discovered a dozen accounts , pages and groups on both Facebook and Instagram that claim to be official hubs of the social networking giant 's new cryptocurrency . Some of these fraudulent pages even advertise that they are selling Libra at a discount through third-party websites despite the fact that Facebook 's new digital currency is currently slated for a 2020 launch . Given its experience with cryptocurrency related scams in the past , the social network should have been prepared that fraudsters would take advantage of Libra . However , Washington Post 's investigation into fake Libra pages has revealed that Facebook was n't prepared and to make matters worse , the news comes at a time when the company is facing increased government and public scrutiny over its plan to launch its own cryptocurrency . The scammers trying to impersonate Facebook used the company 's official logo , Libra 's official marketing images and even photos of CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear more legitimate according to the Washington Post 's findings . For instance , one page contained links to a site called BuyLibraCoins.com that was both well-designed and even included links to buy Libra tokens even though they have yet to have been released . On the other hand , other pages appear to have been setup to reserve important Libra brand names for future use . In addition to fake pages on Facebook and Instagram , the investigation also discovered an influx of scam pages and videos on Twitter and YouTube regarding Libra . Facebook has now removed many of the pages discovered by the publication but this is likely not the last we 'll hear of Libra scams as we get closer to the launch of the social network 's cryptocurrency .

Facebook is set to hike the price of its Workplace collaboration suite in a major upheaval of its business products . From September 2nd , Workplace will be increasing in price , with an entirely new offering also on the way for more advanced customers . The basic tier , which is set to remain free of charge , will be rebranded as Workplace Essential , with the existing premium tier ( currently available for $ 3 per active user per month ) will be rebranded as Workplace Advanced , with the price rising to $ 4 per active user per month . Facebook will also be launching a new highertier of service called Workplace Enterprise , which will cost $ 8 per user per month . This new top-tier product will offer a new set of services specifically around guaranteed , quicker support and users will also be the first to get early access to new features . However there will also be extra `` Frontline '' add-ons for workers such as cashiers or customer service reps , who will cost an extra $ 1.50 per person per month . The costs across all the tiers will now also be for all users , regardless of whether they are active on the service or not . Asides from the pricing changes , that 's about it for the changes , with the features across all tiers remaining the same as they were , meaning you 'll still get Groups , Storage , Analytics and much more . Both Workplace Advanced and Enterprise will be available globally for new customers from 2nd September 2019 . `` This is just the next step on our journey to give the world a place to work together , '' Facebook 's Julien Codorniou wrote in a blog post announced the news . `` We ’ ll continue to develop and refine Workplace in partnership with our customers . And we ’ ll continue to innovate and build features that make work even faster , bring people even closer , and make company culture even stronger . '' Facebook launched Workplace back in 2016 as its attempt to break into the lucrative business market , but it has faced increasing competition from the likes of Slack and Microsoft Teams . The platform has had some success though , signing up over two million paying customers to date , including the likes of Walmart , Nestle and GSK , as well as more than 150 companies signed up with more than 10,000 employees each .

Facebook is set to face further scrutiny on its ambitions to launch a cryptocurrency after `` very serious concerns '' were raised by senior US government members . The company is set to be questioned by the US Senate Banking Committee over its Libra cryptocurrency as the government looks to clarify its stance on the technology . Head of Messenger and Vice President of Messaging Products at Facebook David Marcus will take to the stand to face questioning from government officials on the company 's plans . Facebook is set to launch both Libra and its Calibra digital wallet next year , but has been tight-lipped on what form both offerings will actually take . It has said it wo n't launch Libra until all of the regulatory issues are addressed . Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a press conference today said the Treasury Department has `` very serious concerns '' that Libra could be used by money launderers , terrorist financiers and other criminals . This follows the department seeing other leading cryptocurrencies abused to fund a wide range of illegal activities around the world , and fears that this may grow if Facebook launches a new offering on its global platform . Despite this , Mnuchin added that the US `` welcomes responsible innovation , including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and expand access to financial services . '' `` With respect to Facebook 's Libra and other developments in cryptocurrencies , our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse , '' Mnuchin said . The news came days after President Trump tweeted his opposition to cryptocurrencies in general , noting that he was `` not a fan '' as they were `` not money '' and `` highly volatile and based on thin air .

Facebook is set to face a $ 5bn fine following an investigation into the Cambridge Analytica data-stealing scandal . The punishment comes from the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , which has been looking into the incident since it was revealed by whistleblowers in 2018 . The $ 5bn fine was approved by the FTC in a 3-2 vote , but still needs to be cofnirmed by the civil division of the Justice Department . If approved , it will be the largest punishment ever dished out by the FTC to a technology company . The FTC began investigating Facebook back in March 2018 following worldwide outrage after it was revealed by whistleblower ( and former CA employee ) Christopher Wylie that Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of tens of millions of Facebook users . Users taking a personality quiz via an app on the site had their data collected by Facebook , but the company also recorded the public data of their friends - with around 87 million users thought to be affected despite only 305,000 users installing the quiz app . This data was then sold to Cambridge Analytica , which allegedly then used it to psychologically profile US voters and target them with material to help Donald Trump 's 2016 presidential campaign . Neither Facebook or the FTC has commented on the decision , but the social media giant had said earlier this year it was anticipating a fine of around this amount , and had adjusted its financial performance expectations as such . Facebook was fined £500,000 by the UK 's data protection watchdog back in October after the ICO said the company had allowed a `` serious breach '' of the law to take place .

In March this year , Facebook released a tool called “ Why am I seeing this ? ” , which allowed users to take a deeper look at the ads they were being shown and the reason they were being targeted . The service was created in response to the public outcry following events like the Cambridge Analytica scandal , which raised concerns about the abuse of user data by giant tech companies and the lack of privacy that it entails . Today , Facebook has announced that it 's further improved the tool , claiming to have increased the amount of transparency offered overall . This includes much more intricate detail on the reason for being targeted , a clearer list of the companies that own and sell your data , and a direct link to a page where you can change your targeting preferences , including the ability to opt out entirely in certain instances . The feature is relatively easy to access . When you notice an ad in your Facebook feed , clicking on the three dots in the top right corner of it allows you to access a “ Why am I seeing this ? ” screen . Previously , this area would show you one or two reasons for the ad being targeted at you . The reasons given were often rather vague , perhaps pointing out that you ’ re in an appropriate demographic to be targeted , or that you had visited the website of the product being advertised . With the update , the list of reasons will reportedly be more specific and complete , offering up particular details , such as the pages that you have liked or interests that you have listed , and how this has influenced the targeting . This improved page will also show you exactly where this information came from and gives you more direct controls for either hiding ads from this source or adjusting the control this advertiser has . A brief video courtesy of Facebook demonstrates the updated `` Why am I seeing this ? '' tab . Despite the apparent improvements to the clarity of these options , it ’ s still a rather labyrinthine process to access the settings , although once you have navigated to the appropriate page , the details on offer are more thorough . In order to view which marketing companies and data brokers have your information and are selling it to advertisers , head to Settings > Ads > Advertisers and Businesses > “ Who have uploaded and shared a list with your info ” . This shows you a list of all the companies with your personal data , from which point you can select ‘ View details ’ on each one and , for those users that have received the update , open the ‘ Privacy options ’ tab and opt out . While the update is now live , it isn ’ t yet available to everyone . Facebook hasn ’ t explicitly stated when it will become available to every user , but it 's expected to slowly roll out in full over the coming weeks .

Facebook has introduced a tool that lets you see which third-party websites and apps are sending it your browsing history , and stop them doing so in future . The feature , which is currently available in Ireland , Spain and South Korea , is found in the mobile app 's settings under the heading 'Off-Facebook Activity ' . It allows you to see which companies have shared data about your browsing habits using tracking tools like The Facebook Pixel and Facebook Login . If you 've ever spent some time shopping online , then visited Facebook and been showered with ads for the items you were looking at , these are the tools responsible . You can deactivate 'Off-Facebook Activity ' , preventing this tracking happening in future . However , as The Guardian reports , it 's not possible to delete the data that these third parties have already sent to Facebook . There is an option labelled 'Clear history ' , but this will only disconnect the connected data from your account . This means Facebook ca n't use your browsing data to send you individually targeted ads , but can still use it to get a broader picture of users ' interests . This is the first time you 've been able to see exactly which companies have been supplying Facebook with information on your browsing habits , and the transparency is welcome , but it 's a pity you ca n't actually purge the data that has already been gathered . With this in mind , the fact that Facebook has labelled the option 'Clear data ' is rather misleading . Hopefully it will replace it with something more accurate like 'Anonymize data ' before the feature rolls out globally in the coming months .

Facebook has been accused of letting down its users after a significant data breach last year . The social media giant did not provide users with enough warning that their Facebook accounts could be compromised and their data stolen due to security flaws in its sign-on system , a new lawsuit has said . Facebook is being sued in the US following last year 's attack , which left around 29 million user accounts open to hackers . The accusation came as part of an ongoing court case lodged by a group of Facebook users following the September 2018 breach . Hackers were able to acccess millions of Facebook accounts after stealing `` access tokens '' used to log in users connecting via third-party apps and services . Users would sign in to the site via these services using their Facebook login details , meaning that gaining control of the access tokens would give attackers entry to full accounts . “ Facebook knew about the access token vulnerability and failed to fix it for years , despite that knowledge , ” the court filing at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco read . “ Even more egregiously , Facebook took steps to protect its own employees from the security risk , but not the vast majority of its users . ” Of those affected in the attack , around 14 million saw profile details such as birth dates , employers , education history , religious preference , types of devices used , pages followed and recent searches and location check-ins stolen . Names and contact details were exposed for the other 15 million users , with around 400,000 others having their posts and lists of friends and groups open . Facebook has yet to respond to the filing , but faces yet more questioning over its security protection systems . The company Facebook was fined a record $ 5bn by the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) last month to settle privacy concerns over the Cambridge Analytica data-stealing scandal . Via Reuters

Facebook , much like Amazon , Google and Apple , has been paying contractors to transcribe snippets of its users ' speech . According to Time , a source closely involved in the work claimed that they had been given sound file to work on , but not told where they 'd come from . Facebook has confirmed that it did indeed commission the work , but says that it halted the program after the eavesdropping of other tech companies started to hit the headlines . “ Much like Apple and Google , we paused human review of audio more than a week ago , '' a company spokesperson said . Facebook was also keen to point out that the messages were only transcribed to check that they were being interpreted correctly by its speech recognition software . Only users who had opted into the program had their speech transcribed , and that all snippets were anonymized so there was no way of linking an audio file to a specific user . It 's no surprise that Facebook acted preemptively – the company suffered a serious blow to its reputation following the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal , which involved millions of users ' personal information being shared without consent . Facebook embarked on a huge campaign to win back users ' shaken trust , including print advertisements and an apologetic video in which it promised to `` do more to keep you safe and protect your privacy '' . However , the dust has n't yet settled , and a few weeks ago the company was hit with a $ 5bn fine from the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) as a result of the scandal . `` Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared , Facebook undermined consumers ' choices , '' said FTC chairman Joe Simons . Facebook ca n't afford to look complacent in the face of another potential privacy problem , so pulling the plug on third-party transcriptions was the only sensible course of action . If you 're not sure how much data you 've consented to share , this is a good time to take a good look at your privacy settings .

Facebook is working on a dark mode for its mobile app giving you an alternative to the current stark white design . Researcher Jane Manchun Wong , who frequently combs through code in search of new features , did some digging into the Android app , and discovered that Facebook was working on a new , darker look . The dark color scheme is clearly still a work in progress , and Manchun Wong 's discoveries show some of the problems that have dogged many other apps ' dark modes , including dark colored text that 's almost unreadable against a black background . Nevertheless , it 's a refreshing change for the app , which became even brighter and whiter with the launch of the new FB5 interface earlier this year . Whereas the app had previously made heavy use of the color blue , FB5 is dazzling , which can make for uncomfortable reading at night . The FB5 design was applied to the apps for both Android and iOS , so it stands to reason that if the dark mode would be rolled out to both . Facebook is fairly late to the dark mode party , and there 's no estimate of when the new interface will be available , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing . By waiting , Facebook will be able to learn from the experiences of developers who have been quicker to create dark modes for their apps . For example , Google is working on an update for Chrome that will stop the browser inverting the colors of all images in dark mode – something an image-heavy app like Facebook will want to avoid .

Messaging apps that offer VoIP calling ( Voice over Internet Protocol ) typically utilize an ‘ always-on ’ behavior in order to answer calls more quickly by continuously running in the background , but Apple wants that to stop . As reported by The Information , Apple is implementing a change in iOS 13 – the upcoming version of its mobile operating system for iPhones – that will restrict background access of the calling functionality from all messaging apps , including Facebook 's Messenger and WhatsApp . There are multiple reasons for the change , but the main two relate to device performance and user privacy . Clamping down on the apps that can run on a device in the background should help improve its battery life by reducing processing demand , which should also nudge up its overall performance . The other , and more pressing issue , is related to what else these apps can do while they ’ re still silently running after the user thinks they have been closed . In the past , concerns have been raised about the potential for companies to use their apps to collect data when running in the background , and some were guilty of doing exactly that . In 2015 , Facebook was found to be abusing its VoIP capabilities in its main iOS app in order to run in the background , even when permissions to do so were explicitly disabled . Furthermore , Facebook had already launched the Messenger app by this point and didn ’ t even need VoIP functionality . While Facebook-developed apps such as Messenger and WhatsApp are some of the more prominent to be impacted by this new change , others such as Snapchat and WeChat will also be affected . WhatsApp in particular will apparently have to undergo a major overhaul , as “ people familiar with the issue ” told The Information that the app ’ s end-to-end encryption – along with several other features – rely on this background operation . A spokesperson for Facebook told The Information that it didn ’ t collect any data via this method , clarifying that , `` We are using the PushKit VoIP API to deliver a world-class , private messaging experience , not for the purpose of collecting data . '' While the change will be implemented in the expected September rollout of iOS 13 , Apple is providing some leeway to app developers , giving them until April 2020 to comply . If they do n't , it might be safe to presume these apps could be removed from the App Store .

Facebook confirmed that it 's changing the name of its two most popular apps , Instagram and WhatsApp , to better disclose its ownership of the apps . Soon , Instagram will be known as “ Instagram from Facebook ” while WhatsApp will become “ WhatsApp from Facebook . ” The re-branding effort was discovered on Friday by journalists at The Information , and was then confirmed by representatives of Facebook . `` We want to be clearer about the products and services that are part of Facebook , ” a spokesperson told The Information . Sources told the publication that they were recently notified of the changes and appear to be coming as a result of antitrust regulators scrutinizing the company 's holdings . According to those sources , the app 's name will stay the same on the homescreen of your phone and tablet , however their names will change in the App Store for people first downloading them - a move the company has previously made with its virtual reality-focused sub-division , Oculus . A number of outlets are pointing out that this re-branding effort has been a longtime coming - in fact , blogger Jane Manchun Wong tweeted about it back in March , just a few months after the founders of the company resigned citing a decreasing lack of autonomy . While it 's unclear if the move is a government mandate from the FTC - an entity that , according to The Wall Street Journal , was investigating Facebook 's acquisition of the companies in a potential antitrust case - it appears to be connected . Admittedly , Facebook does n't stand much to gain by putting its name on the apps : It 's already a household name , and one that has become associated with privacy scandals . Putting Facebook 's name on its two most popular apps certainly wo n't make those apps any more popular than they are already and could possibly cause users to be more wary about the security and privacy of those apps . Facebook has yet to say when the changes will go into effect , however we 'll continue to monitor the situation as it develops .

Facebook really , really wants you to make video calls , it seems . A new report by The Information has claimed the social media giant has approached the likes of Hulu , Netflix , and Amazon to get support for their streaming services on a potential TV streaming box - which could launch before the year is out . If that was n't noteworthy enough , it looks like the streaming box in question would come with a camera peripheral to help you make video calls through the television itself . Facebook has already attempted to enter the smart home market with its range of Portal and Portal Plus smart displays , though the camera-focused gadgets have made many consumers uneasy about giving even more data to a company mired in privacy scandals - and recently a $ 5 billion fine for its improper handling of user data . Facebook may hope its fortunes lie elsewhere : with a TV streaming box in the vein of Amazon Fire TV Stick , Google Chromecast , or even Apple TV 4K . Whether Facebook is planning a smaller streaming stick or larger set-top box is yet to be clarified , though keeping a lower profile may be smarter for getting into people 's homes . So , would you put a Facebook-made camera on your television ? There have been built-in webcams in TVs before , but there was never really much of an appetite for it . People do n't currently look to their TVs for that kind of connectivity , though there are currently ways to cast video calls from your smartphone onto a compatible television , using Google Cast ( for Android phones ) or Airplay ( for iPhones ) . Recent smart displays like the Echo Show 5 have made much of privacy features that allow you to physically shutter the camera and disconnect the microphone , to stop either potential hackers ( unlikely ) or smart assistants listening in when you do n't want them to ( likely ) . If Facebook can make a convincing case for a privacy-first device , some may well buy into it ; otherwise , with so many other TV streaming gadgets on the market , and straightforward ways to use your smart TV for calls already , Facebook may have a hard time finding its place in the home .

With the current ubiquity of social media , experts and companies alike have been looking into its potential negative impacts . One such area of concern is in the competitive nature of ‘ counting likes ’ and other such quantifiable interactions . So far , Instagram , the Facebook-owned photo- and video-sharing platform , has already disabled the counter to show how many ‘ likes ’ an individual post receives in Canada , Australia , New Zealand , Japan , Ireland and Brazil . As we discovered at the beginning of September , the social media giant is rolling out the same treatment to its primary Facebook platform , kicking things off in Australia where an increasing number of users will see the change take effect over the coming days . Like with Instagram , users won ’ t be able to see the number of likes on other users ’ content but they will be able to see it on their own posts . The same goes for other reactions , as well as video view counts . As before , the argument for doing so is to reduce the grounds for bullying by way of comparing post engagement – a problem Facebook admits has affected users on both its primary and Instagram platforms . It also aims to introduce a more organic method for exposing popular posts , forcing users to weigh in on them based on their merit alone rather than the existing number of interactions . At this stage , the changes are only being trialled in Australia , with some users already seeing the change and the rest of the country to follow . There ’ s no indication of how long the trial will last before a decision is made to either roll the change out globally or remove it altogether , but it ’ s worth noting that the Instagram trial has thus far been running since late April and shows no sign of stopping .

Adverts on Google are causing users to download more apps than those on Facebook for the first time . According to a new report from marketing analytics firm Appsflyer , Google has increased its share of the app installation sector by eight fold during the last five years and the search giant is now the largest player in the app marketing space . The company 's mobile operating system Android , which now has over 2bn active devices , was largely responsible for its rapid growth when it comes to app marketing . Appsflyer 's report also broke down Google 's ad growth by region and in Latin America the company grew by 18 percent while in Asia , it grew by eight percent during the first half of this year . As app store markets have become more competitive , marketers have begun to invest heavily in moving up the rankings on the Google Play Store and on Apple 's App Store . One example of this is the 82 percent growth experienced by Apple Search Ads which promotes apps at the top of the search rankings on its app store . Appsflyer 's report also highlighted a number of new players in the market such as the advertising arm of the hit Chinese video app Tiktok , Tiktok Ads and the news app Topbuzz . Head of mobile insights at Appsflyer , Shani Rosenfelder provided further insight on the report 's findings , saying : “ For most media sources , making the ranking is a one-time thing . That means maintaining growth in this hyper competitive space is very difficult , so companies must stay alert , recognise potential , and move fast to stay relevant . On a positive note , the fact that we see new companies with different types of products and qualities demonstrates that this industry has plenty of opportunities for those who can survive . ” Via City AM

Facebook Horizon is a social VR hub looking to suck up even more of your time into virtual reality next year . With more than a dose of the massive VR world in the book and 2018 movie Ready Player One , Facebook Horizon will be a social network that operates eantirely in VR for those using Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest headsets . While we have n't got a hands on look yet , we 're told users will be able to `` make their own games and worlds '' , with `` expressive and diverse avatars '' used to navigate the VR world – according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg . Facebook Horizon was announced at the Oculus Connect 6 conference in San Jose , California on September 25-26 this year , and is set to launch sometime in 2020 . You can see an introductory reveal trailer below . While there is n't much in the way of specific details , the trailer above shows off avatars flying planes , painting in VR , and hugging little pink cubes , for some reason . Apparently , there will be a stress on creation tools , and we could see Facebook try to attract fans of games like Minecraft – the highest selling game of all time – wanting to use new VR tools to make and shape the world around them . `` You do n't need to be able to code to create something , '' says Zuckerberg , `` though that can certainly help when making some of the more advanced things . `` It 's just another step towards building the kind of social infrastructure that we believe will be increasingly important for the future . ”

Facebook has bought a startup specializing in neural interface technology , suggesting it might be interested in building the technology into a future Oculus virtual reality headset . As Bloomberg reports , Facebook bought New York company CTRL-Labs for a figure between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million . The four-year-old company will be integrated into Facebook Reality Labs – the augmented reality ( AR ) and virtual reality ( VR ) unit formerly known as Oculus Research . CTRL-Labs has developed a wristband that allows users to control an on-screen avatar . The band does n't 'read minds ' – instead , it detects neuron activity in your arm , and works even if you only think about moving it . “ Your hands could be in your pocket , behind you , ” explained the company 's CEO Thomas Reardon at a conference in December . “ It ’ s the intention [ to move ] , not the movement . ” Interacting in VR is a tricky prospect . Trigger-style controllers ( like those used by existing Oculus headsets ) work well for games , but are n't always a good fit for other virtual experiences . The ability to move an avatar with only a thought could be a much better match for social interaction . When TechRadar spoke to Anna Kozminski ( AR/VR software manager at Facebook Zurich in Switzerland ) earlier this month about the company 's work on immersive VR , she emphasized the importance of making the experience as natural as possible . `` With a VR experience , ultimately you want it to feel as fluid as real life , '' she said . Her vision for the future of VR is one where you can speak to friends and relatives in other countries as though there 's no difference in geography at all . Truly hands-free interaction could be a big step towards making that possible . Via Engadget

Would you buy Facebook smart glasses ? The social media giant seems to be banking on it , with a new report by CNBC pointing to ambitious plans around AR wearables in the coming years . Codenamed `` Orion '' , the smart glasses are reportedly being poised as a replacement for smartphones . With functionality that includes taking and making calls , live-streaming footage to the internet , as well as using AR overlays to show information in the wearer 's view , there 's certainly a lot to keep a user occupied . These claims come from `` people familiar '' with the device in question , who also stated that Facebook had brokered a deal with Ray-Ban parent company Luxottica , in order to provide a form factor for the smart glasses that people would actually want to wear . Given Ray-Ban 's reputation for stylish sunglasses with a classic design , the collaboration could well be what saves the product from sinking at launch . It 's unsurprising that Facebook would need the help , given the usual complaints around design for commercial smart glasses – whether Google Glass , Microsoft Hololens 2 , or even the rounded Snapchat Spectacles 2 . Obviously glasses are mainly for looking , but unless they look somewhat appealing too , AR glasses are unlikely to catch on in a mainstream market – which is why much of the chatter around the Magic Leap One AR headset has centered around its looks . We reported earlier this year on speculation around Facebook 's AR hardware plans , though there 's been no official word on the capabilities , pricing , or likely release date for anything Facebook is working on in this area . However , as with any in-development product , even reliable information could become redundant as Facebook 's own internal plans change .

Facebook has announced a new entry in its range of Portal smart displays , the Portal TV – designed to make use of your big-screen TV for large-scale video calls . Clipping to the top of a flatscreen TV , the Portal TV is essentially hacks your television ’ s screen and speakers , turning it into a smart display far larger than the 10-inch Portal or eight-inch Portal Mini . Integrated speakers also allow you to speak with an Alexa or Portal smart assistant even when your TV is off , while a Watch Together feature synchronizes Facebook Watch shows over calls . There were reports back in August of Facebook looking to create a TV-centered device , though it sounded more like a set-top box than a smart display accessory . With the Facebook Watch platform continuing to be pushed through the range , though , and TV streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video or Netflix possibly joining down the line , this vision could still come to pass . The Portal TV retails at $ 149 / £149 in the US , UK , and Europe . The entire Facebook Portal range – with a redesigned picture frame shape for non-TV models – will also be getting support for encrypted Whatsapp calls to any other Whatsapp-installed device , in what might be a killer app for the smart displays , alongside enhanced muting and privacy features . Finally expanding beyond the US , the Facebook Portal , Portal Plus , and Portal Mini models will all be available to the UK and Europe from October 15 . The Portal will be retailing for $ 179 / £169 , the Portal Plus for £269 , and Portal Mini for $ 129 / £129 – with $ 50 / £50 off models bundled together . The Portal TV marks an interesting moment for the software company – now turned hardware manufacturer – especially given Apple ’ s move towards software services as it sees sales of its iPhone handsets slip . With many having valid privacy concerns about Facebook ’ s use , or misuse of data , having a Facebook-owned product that films and records you in your own home is a hard proposition – though the Whatsapp encryption and hard camera shutter coming to new models will likely offset that to a certain extent .

VR can be a pain – setting up sensors or emitters , connecting cables and configuring the hardware can take so long , it might not seem worthwhile for a quick gaming session . It ’ s all too easy for that expensive VR headset to be left gathering dust – even if you ’ ve invested in a powerful gaming PC to support it . The release of Oculus Go in 2018 went some way towards changing that , offering a VR experience that was fully self-contained , with no wires or need for additional hardware . Just strap on the headset and get started . It was impressive stuff , and far more affordable than other VR headsets available at the time , but was much more limited than more powerful , tethered headsets . Most significantly , its movement system was ‘ orientation only ’ , meaning you could turn your head to look around the environment , but couldn ’ t move through it . That all changed with the release of Oculus Quest in May this year . The Quest is still fully wireless , but unlike the Go , it offers six degrees of freedom – all without the need for any external hardware dotted around your room . How is that possible ? TechRadar spoke to Anna Kozminski , AR/VR software manager at Facebook Zurich in Switzerland , to learn how Oculus cut the cord on virtual reality . First , a quick explanation : six degrees of freedom means your body can move in three dimensions along the X , Y and Z axes . Moving up and down along the Y axis is called ‘ heaving ’ , moving forward and back along the X axis is called ‘ surging ’ , and moving left and right along the Z axis is called ‘ swaying ’ . You can also turn to face a different axis . A movement between X and Y is called ‘ pitch ’ , a movement between X and Z is called ‘ yaw ’ , and a movement between Z and Y is called ‘ roll ’ . `` To make it feel fully natural , we needed to track the user ’ s movements extremely precisely in real time '' If you want to create a truly immersive VR experience , that ’ s essential . “ With a VR experience , ultimately you want it to feel as fluid as real life – you don ’ t want to be distracted because the display is lagging or jittering , ” explains Kozminski . “ To make it feel fully natural , we needed to track the user ’ s movements extremely precisely in real time , so as you move your head and hands , those movements are perfectly represented in the virtual world . ” Oculus Quest is the first consumer device with full six-degrees of freedom tracking , made possible by the Oculus Insight system . This uses a technology called simultaneous location and mapping ( SLAM ) , which uses input from various sensors to fix an object ’ s location within a constantly updated virtual map . It uses these objects as reference points ( much like you ’ d use landmarks to orient yourself ) and anchors them to points in the virtual world . These points are observed repeatedly to compensate for drift ( where tiny measurement discrepancies add up over time , making the map less accurate ) . The virtual area encompasses your whole field of view , so the system needs to respond as quickly as you can move and any tracking errors or lag are very noticeable . “ This tracking from six degrees of movement has been done before , but with a lot of external sensors in the room , and that presented a big barrier to entry , ” said Kozminski . “ You can ’ t share the device , you can ’ t bring it over to a friend ’ s house . [ Our goal was to ] his that level of immersion , but make it more practical so more people can use it . ” To achieve that , Oculus had to move the software stack that does all the computation onto the headset itself . That presented a serious challenge ; how do you put that kind of complex system onto something that ’ s lightweight , wearable , and powered by a rechargeable battery ? “ There were a lot of challenges developing the architecture to use the least amount of power and leave a lot of space on the device for gaming content , ” she said . “ Oculus Insight is a gaming platform , but if there ’ s no content to enjoy , it ’ s moot . [ We had to ] break the trend that it can only run on powerful PCs , and enable developers to create cool games and experiences . ” `` We had to collect thousands and thousands of data sets , coming up with all the different parameters of lighting and décor '' Of course , a room in your house could be totally different from one in your friend ’ s , so the system had to be capable of handling a huge range of conditions . “ The algorithm is very sensitive to what kind of environment it ’ s used in , ” said Kozminski . “ The lighting conditions , the size of the space , the amount of texture on the walls and surfaces – but we can ’ t predict how people are going to set up their living room . Maybe they want to have dim lighting [ for example ] . “ We had to collect thousands and thousands of data sets , coming up with all the different parameters of lighting and décor , then replay on Facebook ’ s servers and simulate the real use of the headset so we could compute metrics . It was a years-long effort . ” The work was worthwhile , though , and the hardware developers have been hugely impressed by what creatives have managed to achieve with it . We asked Kozminski about her favorites so far . “ I think there are two , ” she said . “ One is external uses in general , and one is an internal project . When it comes to external uses , I ’ m a big fan of 360-degree videos , in addition to gaming . When producers take 360-degree cameras into an environment like a rainforest or refugee camp and tell a message in video content , that ’ s really compelling . You have to be in someone else ’ s shoes to experience it . The video content is really compelling VR because it feels like you ’ re really there , and it gives you that first-person perspective , which is powerful in building empathy . `` VR can be a lonely experience if you use it on your own , and our aim is to create meaningful connections '' “ We did a demo at OC5 last year – a proof of concept for future applications of Oculus , with six users in a Western-style shootout game in an arena . We were co-locating multiple players . Today you can do multiplayer experiences , but there ’ s nothing to indicate is that player is actually right next to you . In that demo , we shared the same map across all the devices in that co-located piece . “ VR can be a lonely experience if you use it on your own , and our aim is to create meaningful connections . That demo was a show of where we could go in the future to area-shared experiences – whether it ’ s playing or just hanging out . ” Kozminski and her colleagues at Facebook aren ’ t resting on their laurels . “ Now that we ’ ve shipped the Quest , our team is busy writing new features that we ’ re shipping almost every month , ” she said . It ’ s not all about gaming , though – Oculus is a Facebook project , so it ’ s no surprise that the ultimate goal is connecting people . And to do that , the barrier to entry will need to be lowered even further “ I ’ ve got family who live in Canada , ” Kosminski explains , “ and with these VR experiences we ’ ve got multiplayer games , but in the future we want to be able to bring two people who are very far apart into the same experience and make them feel like they are in the same place . I want to get to a point where I can put on a headset and hang out with my brother in Canada like we ’ re in the same space – whether that ’ s in VR or AR . “ The Oculus Insight technology is what we will use to power AR glasses in the future . We ’ ve talked about investing in AR , and ultimately when we get to a lighter form factor – something that is more comfortable to wear – more people will use it and we can get more people into this community to have experiences digitally . Getting to AR glasses and dissolving these geographic divides . ”
Rumors were already swirling about Facebook readying a new Portal device that streams media to your television set , and a new report fills in some of the details about the gadget , which is set to launch before the end of the year . Sources speaking to Variety have backed up claims that a media streaming device is indeed on the way , one that does n't have its own screen but attaches to the larger one sat in your living room . The original Facebook Portal and Portal+ devices were focused on audio and video calling across the Facebook platform , and the new box is being tipped to add extra functionality while keeping those original features . Third-party content from the likes of Netflix and Disney could be consolidated in one central interface , Variety says , perhaps using the same approach as the Oculus TV app which runs on Facebook 's VR headsets . The box may well come with its own set of integrated speakers , according to sources , so you wo n't necessarily have to rely on the speakers built into your TV set . Finally , Variety reports that augmented reality filters – like the ones available in Facebook Messenger and on the original Portal devices – are going to be included again , which should add to the appeal for the kids at least . It seems certain now that more Portal hardware is on the way from Facebook – and whatever form it takes , it should be out in time for the Christmas rush .

Facebook has revealed more details about its upcoming Libra cryptocurrency launch , stating that it wants to tie the system to some of the biggest national currencies around . The social media giant has told US senators that Libra will be tied to a number of top currencies , including the US dollar , euro , yen and British pound . Facebook is set to launch both Libra and its Calibra digital wallet next year , but has been tight-lipped on what form both offerings will actually take - although it has said Libra wo n't launch until all of the regulatory issues are addressed . Facebook is currently laying out its plans to lawmakers in the US as it looks to allay concerns around Libra following grilling back in July by the US Senate Banking Committee . This latest clarification comes after Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner raised concerns that China may push the company to include the yuan as part of its system . Warner has urged the Libra Association , the arm of Facebook governing the launch , to exclude the yuan as he believes China is attempting to further stabilise its own currency . “ Any decision whether to add a new currency to the Libra Reserve would be made based on all the facts and circumstances at the time , including any direct or indirect regulatory restrictions , ” Facebook wrote . The company also suggested that Libra may launch outside the US , despite these concerns . “ We understand that the Libra Association will not offer the Libra digital currency in any jurisdiction until it has fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals in that jurisdiction , ” Facebook wrote , noting that it would look to comply with U.S. regulatory requirements .

Until April 2018 , Facebook users could search for each other using phone numbers or email addresses . However , in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data abuse scandal – which saw the personal information of 87 million Facebook users mined – the social media giant scrapped that feature , restricting accessibility to user information . Yet a security researcher has recently told TechCrunch that a database containing 419 million phone numbers linked to Facebook accounts was sitting on a server that was not password protected , just waiting for anyone to find it . While the server does not belong to Facebook , the database reveals the unique Facebook ID linked to each of the phone numbers – in some cases the names , gender and locations are also listed . Amongst the hundreds of millions of records exposed , 133 million belong to US users , 18 million are UK-based user records , and 50 million from Vietnam . TechCrunch was able to verify several records by matching a known user ’ s phone number to a Facebook user ID or by matching phone numbers with the social media site ’ s password reset feature . While Facebook has been made aware of the security lapse and has since launched an investigation , a spokesperson for the company has said the database contains “ information obtained before [ Facebook ] made changes last year to remove people ’ s ability to find others using their phone numbers ” , and was “ closer to half ” the number TechCrunch reported due to duplicate records . The spokesperson also said that the database has been taken down , confirming that there is “ no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised ” .

Facebook is rolling out facial recognition to all of its 360 million users , making it easier than ever for your friends and family to tag you in embarrassing photos . Facial recognition first arrived on Facebook in 2017 under the name 'Tag Suggestions ' , but was only available to a small sample of users . It 's now accessible worldwide under the more logical name 'Face Recognition ' . Face Recognition will be turned off by default , and if you were n't part of the Tag Suggestions trial group , you 'll see a notification in your News Feed asking if you want to activate it . New users signing up for Facebook will also receive a News Feed notification letting them know about Face Recognition . If you were part of the Tag Suggestions group , however , you wo n't get the News Feed alert . To check your facial recognition settings , take a look in your privacy options and see whether the new Face Recognition switch is toggled on . Facebook 's decision to make facial recognition global is a bold one , due to the bad press the technology has received in recent weeks . San Francisco banned police forces from using facial recognition in May , and a London housing developer was prompted to switch off facial recognition at a site in King 's Cross after public backlash . There 's also increasing concern about the use of facial recognition at airports , which critics worry will normalize the technology and socialize people to accept it . Facebook has published a blog post that aims to allay any fears about its own use of facial recognition . `` We ’ ve continued to engage with privacy experts , academics , regulators and people on Facebook about how we use face recognition and the options you have to control it , '' the company said . `` We ’ ve made the steps to update your settings clearer and you can opt to leave your setting off right in the notice , as opposed to having to go to a separate screen . If you do nothing , face recognition will remain off for you . '' Whether you 're happy with facial recognition or not , this is a good time to take a look through the rest of your privacy settings on Facebook and make sure they 're all up to date – particularly if you have n't checked them since last year , when the company embarked on a major overhaul to make them more transparent .

Facebook may soon hide 'like ' counts from your friends and followers , so only you can see how well a post or picture has been received . Prolific app researcher Jane Manchun Wong spent time reverse-engineering Facebook 's Android app , and discovered code that suggests that the company may soon begin making likes and reactions private . Facebook has since confirmed to TechCrunch that it 's considering implementing the feature . If and when it arrives , other users will be able to see that a post has received some likes , but wo n't be shown an exact number . Facebook is already testing a similar feature for Instagram in Canada , Australia , New Zealand , Japan , Ireland and Brazil . The change is intended to make the platform less competitive and reduce bullying – something Instagram admits is a major problem . “ We hope this test will remove the pressure of how many likes a post will receive , so you can focus on sharing the things you love , ” said Mia Garlick , director of public policy for Facebook and Instagram in Australia and New Zealand , when the change rolled out in July . It seems likely that a similar test for the Facebook app would also be restricted to certain regions at first . We 'll keep you updated once we know more .

Facebook has confirmed it will be paying a record fine in the UK concerning its involvement with Cambridge Analytica . The social media giant revealed it has reached a settlement with the UK Information Commisioner 's Office ( ICO ) concerning its alleged misuse and sale of user data , and will be dropping its appeal . Facebook was fined £500,000 by the UK 's data protection watchdog a year ago after the ICO said the company had allowed a `` serious breach '' of the law to take place . However Facebook appealed against the punishment , arguing there was no evidence to suggest that any private user data was used by Cambridge Analytica or any affiliates to target voters in the build up to the 2016 Brexit vote . The company has now said it will pay the fine in full , but will not need to admit any liability or wrongdoing about what happened . “ The ICO welcomes the agreement reached with Facebook for the withdrawal of their appeal against our Monetary Penalty Notice ( MPN ) and agreement to pay the fine , ” noted ICO deputy commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone . “ The ICO ’ s main concern was that U.K. citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm . Protection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance , not only for the rights of individuals , but also as we now know , for the preservation of a strong democracy . ” The fine was the maximum allowed by the ICO 's own guidelines at the time , however if the investigation had taken place a few months later , after GDPR had come into force , the punishment for Facebook could have been much higher . `` As we have said before , we wish we had done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica in 2015 , ” Facebook general counsel Harry Kinmonth noted . “ We made major changes to our platform back then , significantly restricting the information which app developers could access . Protecting people ’ s information and privacy is a top priority for Facebook , and we are continuing to build new controls to help people protect and manage their information . '' `` The ICO has stated that it has not discovered evidence that the data of Facebook users in the EU was transferred to Cambridge Analytica by Dr Kogan . ” Users taking a personality quiz via an app on the site had their data collected by Facebook , but the company also recorded the public data of their friends - with around 87 million users thought to be affected despite only 305,000 users installing the quiz app . This data was then sold to Cambridge Analytica , which allegedly then used it to psychologically profile US voters and target them with material to help Donald Trump 's 2016 presidential campaign and the Brexit referendum . The news may only be a minor let-off for Facebook , as it could face further punishment in other nations where user data was compromised . The company could face a fine of up to $ 5bn under plans from the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , which has also been looking into the incident .

Facebook is rolling out a new `` Preventative Health '' tool that will prompt you to book a flu shot , get your blood pressure tested and check your cholesterol . The rollout is beginning in the US , but may be extended elsewhere in the future . As Engadget reports , this follows the success of Facebook 's blood donation feature , which matches donors with blood banks and was introduced in the US earlier this year after its launch in India in 2017 . As its name suggests , the new tool will encourage you to attend scans and tests that can detect potential problems early , enabling you and your doctor to take action before they become anything serious . The recommendations can be tailored according to your age and sex , and will focus on tests that can detect early signs of cancer and heart disease . The app will advise you when it 's a good time to book a checkup , and send you a reminder close to the date . When it 's done , you can tick it off as complete until next time it 's due . Health is a deeply personal matter , and some people will no doubt have reservations about sharing details of their forthcoming cholesterol check with a company that 's not known for its careful handling of their data . Perhaps the biggest worry ( particularly for users in the US ) is that information about health concerns could find its way into the hands of insurance companies , which could then crank up charges or deny coverage . Facebook has therefore decided to step in early and explain exactly how it will ( and wo n't ) use information about your well-being . `` Your activity within Preventive Health will not be posted publicly or shared with others , '' Facebook says . `` Information you provide is securely stored and access is restricted to a group of people at Facebook who work on the product or maintain our systems . '' `` We don ’ t share personal information about your activity in Preventive Health with third parties , such as health organizations or insurance companies , so it can ’ t be used for purposes like insurance eligibility . '' You can enter the dates and times of your tests , and mark them as done , but there 's no way for Facebook to find out the results . You can tell friends and family about Preventative Health on your news feed , but doing so wo n't share your activity with them . Facebook also wo n't use data from Preventative Health to target you with ads , though it 's worth bearing in mind that visiting other websites or clicking links to health organizations ' pages could affect the ads you see .

It 's taken over your social life and your event planning , and now Facebook wants to bring you the news too : it 's rolling out a dedicated news tab in its mobile apps , offering up headlines from a selected number of publishers . You wo n't necessarily see this in your own Facebook app yet though , as the feature has only been enabled for a select number of users in the US so far , and there 's no set timescale for a wider roll out . The news tab `` gives people more control over the stories they see , and the ability to explore a wider range of their news interests , directly within the Facebook app , '' Facebook 's Campbell Brown said in a blog post . `` It also highlights the most relevant national stories of the day . News articles will continue to appear in News Feed as they do today , '' adds Brown . Facebook says the news tab will incorporate four categories : general , topical , diverse and local news . To appear in the app tab , publishers must register with Facebook and abide by its guidelines . You 'll be able to customize the stories you see as well , hiding publications you do n't want to read , and picking your favorite topics ( like entertainment , health , business , sports and so on ) . A mixture of algorithms and human curation is going to be used to select the stories that show up , Facebook says , and the feature has been developed in consultation with publishers . As yet there 's no sign of the News tab appearing on the web . You can read more about the initiative , and see some of the publishers that have signed up , at the dedicated Facebook News page .

Facebook has begun rolling out a new interface for desktop users , with an optional dark mode in addition to the traditional white design . When they log into the desktop site , some users have reported seeing a pop-up asking whether they would like to try the new design , which is referred to as 'Facebook Beta ' . If you 're part of the testing group , after accepting the offer , you will be offered the chance to switch to dark mode and take it for a spin . You can also switch between light and dark modes through your account settings . Android Police has gathered a collection of screengrabs showing what to expect . In addition to the optional dark mode , Facebook Beta also promises to be clearer and easier to use , with larger fonts and streamlined navigation . It will also save your position if you 're scrolling through your news feed and then navigate elsewhere , so you do n't lose your place . Facebook often limits its betas to specific countries ( usually the US ) , but the testing group for the new interface seems to include users from around the world , so try logging in and see if you 're among them . Facebook testing new Design in the UK @ 9to5mac # facebook pic.twitter.com/TdS05QwEFnOctober 13 , 2019 There 's no way to request to join the testing group , unfortunately , so if you do n't see the pop-up you 'll have to wait for the final release .

Facebook wants you to head to its site and apps for news coverage as well as memes that your friends and family are sharing : the social media giant has apparently struck a deal with news providers that will let it display headlines in a dedicated news tab . That 's as per a report from the Wall Street Journal , which says licensing fees and other details have been worked out with the WSJ , the New York Post , the Washington Post , BuzzFeed News and Business Insider . Part of the negotiations involved working out how paywalls would be handled , the WSJ says – news providers are n't going to want to give away all their stories for free . According to inside sources , not all of the 200 or so news outlets will be paid , but for the biggest ones , the licensing fees could run into the millions of dollars per year . Both human editors and algorithms are going to be used to pick the best stories of the day , the WSJ reports , and there wo n't be any advertising in this new news tab . With the fees agreed , a launch could happen before the end of the month . This has n't come completely out of the blue : earlier this year Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was exploring the idea of adding news to the site and apps . `` It 's important to me that we help people get trustworthy news and find solutions that help journalists around the world do their important work , '' said Zuckerberg back in April . The arrangements that Facebook has reached with publishers sound similar to those struck to set up Apple News Plus , the digital newspaper and magazine bundle service that launched in March .

Mastercard and Visa have become the latest backers to withdraw their support for the Facebook Libra cryptocurrency . The two payment giants have both dropped their backing for Libra , which looked to offer a new way of paying friends , family and businesses . Facebook is set to launch both Libra and its Calibra digital wallet next year , but has been tight-lipped on what form both offerings will actually take . It has said it wo n't launch Libra until all of the regulatory issues are addressed . The news comes shortly after PayPal also announced it would be pulling its backing for Libra , with eBay and Stripe also dropping out recently . Libra revealed 28 major firms as launch partners back in June , who were meant to assist with governing the project , which has come under fierce scrutiny from lawmakers around the world . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to appear before the US house committee on financial services on October 23 to answer questions on Libra . The Libra Association was set to announce its founder members later this week , but the project has now lost a significant number of the initial 28 supporters . Mastercard and Visa 's exit leaves Dutch firm PayU as the sole remaining payment provider announced at the launch of Facebook Libra still on board . “ We appreciate their support for the goals and mission of the Libra project , '' a spokesperson for the Libra Association said . “ Although the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time , the design principle of Libra ’ s governance and technology , along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient .

In what may have been an accidental glimpse into the future , a screenshot has emerged that appears to show Facebook 's forthcoming dark mode in action on a Pixel device . As PhoneArena reports , a screenshot shared on Reddit towards the end of August shows how one user , The-Respawner managed to grab an image of Facebook entering dark mode on their phone . Considering the popularity of dark modes , it is surprising that Facebook has taken so long to get involved . While some of its apps and services – such as Facebook Messenger for Windows , and WhatsApp – have embrace the eye and battery saving qualities of dark theme options , the main Facebook app are lagging behind . Of course Facebook is working on bringing dark mode to mobile users – it would be crazy not too – but many people are starting to get impatient and would like to know what it is going to look like , as well as when it might appear . Thanks to this new screen grab , we may have a pretty good idea . It seems , however , that the arrival of dark mode in Facebook 's Android app was either a test , a glitch or a mistake . As quickly as the darker hue arrived , they vanished . But The-Respawner is not alone . Other users have started to report the appearance of dark mode in their Facebook app too . On Twitter , Nagesh Bande shared another screenshot of Facebook in dark mode . He does not say which device the screenshot was taken on , nor reveal whether dark mode was a temporary or permanent option : @ realmecareIN @ realmemobiles Dark mode on Facebook pic.twitter.com/plqHiDojkoNovember 25 , 2019 Another Twitter user , Lock , shared a further screenshot showing off dark mode : facebook tengah test dark mode ke tu ? pic.twitter.com/VsLhjarGB0November 17 , 2019 While the image shared on Reddit is now a couple of months old , the sudden appearance of more recent dark mode screenshots online suggests that Facebook has made a good deal of progress , and the option could well be on the verge of a wider rollout . We 'll keep you updated as soon as we know more .

The dark mode phenomenon continues to spread its inky fingers through websites and apps on all platforms – and Facebook is not immune . The Messenger component of social network might be most readily associated with the iOS and Android apps as well as the Facebook website , and it 's easy to forget that there 's actually a Windows 10 Facebook Messenger app available that allows for easy messaging on the desktop . More than this , Facebook is also running a beta program for the Messenger desktop app , trying out new features and options on those eager to use the very latest version of the tool . For anyone with the beta installed , there 's a nice treat available now : dark mode . In fact , the Facebook Messenger beta app includes a number of theming options . You 'll find the new options by clicking the 'Settings ' button ( the gear icon ) to the upper left of the app window , and then heading to the 'Appearance ' section . Click the drop-down menu and you 'll find four options to choose from . Select Light mode , and nothing will change – Messenger will retain its white background . But if you want to dial down the brightness , you have two choices . Select Dark if you really enjoy darker tones , or opt for Gray for something dark but subtle . There 's also the 'Mirror system preferences ' option , which makes Messenger respect the app theme settings you 've set in Windows . Dark mode is n't the only option you 'll find in the beta version of the app . It also allows for easy file-sharing thanks to the fact you can simply drag and drop files onto the Messenger window . Other options include the ability to delete sent messages , and to hide chats . You can download the latest beta version of Facebook Messenger for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store .

Facebook has unveiled a new payments platform aimed at making it easier to send money online . Facebook Pay will work not just across the social network , but also on Messenger , WhatsApp and Instagram , allowing users to transfer funds to their friends and contacts on any of those apps . The company says it will offer `` a convenient , secure and consistent payment experience '' across all those services , with user information remaining secure and protected . After choosing a preferred payment method , Facebook Pay will work instantly , meaning there 's no need to re-enter payment information for each transaction . Users can select whether to limit Facebook Pay to specific apps , and can view their payment history , manage payment methods and update their setting in a single location , with real-time customer support via live chat on offer as well . Facebook Pay is launching on Messenger and Facebook in the US this week , with fundraising , in-game purchases , event tickets , person-to-person payments on Messenger and purchases from select Pages and businesses on Facebook Marketplace the inital use cases made available . The company says that WhatsApp and Instagram will be added `` over time '' but did not confirm exactly when . Facebook Pay will support most major credit and debit cards as well as PayPal , which along with Stripe and other payments firms will handle transaction processing . The news comes after several tough weeks for Facebook 's other financial projects , namely its Libra cryptocurrency , which has lost nearly all of its big-name backers following concerns over how the system would operate . The company emphasised in its launch blog that Facebook Pay is built on existing financial infrastructure and partnerships , and is separate from both Calibra and Libra network .

Facebook is introducing a new option that will let you customize the shortcut bar , and eliminate the red notification dots that pop up within the app . This will be welcome news if you find they appear seemingly at random , and frequently unhelpfully . Did you want to know about new additions to the Marketplace ? No , we thought not . The Shortcut Bar Settings feature is rolling out now for iOS users . It lets you take control not only of notification dots , but also the icons that appear in the shortcut bar at the bottom of the screen in the app . This is great news if you only use a limited range of Facebook 's features . After all , if you never use the Marketplace , there 's little point in cluttering up the screen with a permanent shortcut to it . Speaking to TechCrunch , a Facebook spokesperson said : `` We are rolling out navigation bar controls to make it easier for people to connect with the things they like and control the notifications they get within the Facebook app '' . To access the newly introduced options , you just need to tap and hold any of the buttons in the shortcut bar . A pop-up menu will appear from which you can opt to disable notification dots , hide the button you tapped , or access a more advanced Shortcut Bat settings screen . For now , the new customization options are only available in the iOS version of the Facebook app . While it is quite common for Facebook to bring new features to the iOS and Android version of the app at different times , in the end both tend to end up with the same options . That said , there can sometimes be something of a delay between the arrival of a particular feature on one platform and its appearance on the other . It would be surprising if such sought-after features were exclusive to iOS . Indeed , Facebook has confirmed to TechCrunch that Android users can expect to see notification dot and shortcut bar customisation option `` in the next few weeks '' .

While it has been almost two years since news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal first broke , WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton still thinks that users should delete Facebook . At Wired 's 25th anniversary summit , Acton told a crowd that others should make their own decisions about leaving the social network though he stands by his decision to leave , saying : “ If you want to be on Facebook and you want to have ads thrust in front of you , go to town . ” Acton 's fight against Facebook began in March of 2018 when he took to Twitter to tell others “ It is time ” followed by the hashtag # deletefacebook . When he tweeted that message , Acton had been away from Facebook for more than a year after he stepped down in 2017 over a disagreement regarding monetizing WhatsApp . When asked why he decided to make his feelings about the social media giant so public by journalist Steven Levy , Acton explained that when you leave Facebook you just disappear , saying : “ At the time , there was pressure unfolding against Facebook , I was like , maybe it ’ s time . But then I realized a fatal flaw in Facebook is they don ’ t have tombstones . When you disappear , you disappear . So I left my tombstone on Twitter . To my chagrin was a lot more public and visible . ” Following his departure from WhatsApp , Acton went on to co-found the Signal Foundation and its encrypted messaging app , Signal is now used by journalists and human rights advocates around the world . However , he has his doubts over Mark Zuckerberg 's commitment to bring encryption to Facebook 's apps . The social media giant is currently facing pressure from politicians who have become increasingly concerned over the national security implications of Facebook encrypting its apps . In fact , Attorney General William Barr sent Mark Zuckerberg a letter recently in which he urged him to pause the company 's plans for encryption . Via The Verge

In 2017 , Facebook ever so slightly adjusted its mission statement . Out went a pledge to “ make the world more open and connected ” , and in its place came an intention to “ give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together ” . You could view this as an admission that 'open ' had failed . 'Open ' means open to hate speech , child abuse , violence , sex and the kind of illegal acts Facebook would rather have nothing to do with . And yet the company now finds itself having to clean up such messes every hour of every day . Or rather , it employs outsiders to do said dirty work . In The Cleaners , a documentary by Hans Block and Moritz Riesewieck , contractors from the Philippines candidly discuss the steady stream of sex , violence and hate speech they have to sift through every day . They have to make each decision in eight to 10 seconds , they say , and “ don ’ t overthink ” is a direct quote from the training materials , such as they are . “ Do n't doubt too much whether your decision is right or wrong , because otherwise you will overthink it , and then you wo n't be able to take a decision , ” Riesewieck summarises to TechRadar at Mozilla ’ s Mozfest , where he and his co-director have just been on a panel discussing internet moderation . If ever there were a company to stress test the idea that any problem can be solved with enough money , it ’ s Facebook . And yet , so far , the problem just continues to grow . In 2009 , Facebook had just 12 ( yes , that ’ s twelve ) content moderators looking out for the welfare of 120 million users . There are now over two billion people on the platform and around 15,000 moderators . While that means the ratio of moderator to user has gone up from paltry to feeble , it ’ s worth reflecting that Facebook in 2019 is very different to what it was a decade ago , when the Like button was the latest innovation , and Facebook Live was still years away . “ Estimates say that there are about 100,000 professionals that work in this field , ” says Clara Tsao , a Mozilla fellow and expert in countering online disinformation . They “ deal with the worst of the worst of the internet ’ s trash , ” she adds , noting that on 4chan they ’ re literally called 'janitors ' . Unlike real-world janitors , though , the internet ’ s cleaners aren ’ t always given the right equipment for the enormous task at hand . Facebook ’ s Filipino contingent would occasionally encounter exchanges in languages they didn ’ t speak , using Google Translate to follow meaning . That inevitably takes a sledgehammer to nuance , before you even get onto the cultural differences inevitable between countries separated by an eight-hour time zone gap . Facebook moderators are n't only located in the Philippines . There are offices around the world , and it was in Dublin where Chris Gray found himself after a spell teaching in Asia . Now he ’ s the lead plaintiff representing moderators in High Court proceedings against Facebook . Over a nine-month spell at the company ( in Ireland , most workers are on 11-month contracts , he says but most leave early ) , Gray was dealing with 500-600 bits of content a night , usually in the 6pm to 2am slot . It was only a year after he left that he was officially diagnosed with PTSD . “ It took me a year before I realised that this job had knocked me on my arse , ” he says as part of the panel discussion . This delayed reaction , Riesewieck tells us , isn ’ t wholly uncommon . “ In some cases they told us it 's mostly their friends telling them that they changed , ” he explains . It took me a year before I realised that this job had knocked me on my arse In any case , many of Gray ’ s former colleagues are privately pleased at him breaking NDA and leading the charge to legal action – even if they ’ re not prepared to say so publicly just yet . “ People are just coming out of the woodwork and saying , ‘ Oh , thank God , somebody has spoken out and said this , ’ ” he tells TechRadar later . To be clear , despite having personally been affected by the work , Gray feels that it ’ s misleading to assume it ’ s non-stop gore , child exploitation and sex . “ To be honest , most of the work is tedious , ” he says . “ It ’ s just people reporting each other because they 're having an argument and they want to use some process to get back at the other person . ” Tedious , but high pressure . In the Irish office , Gray had 30 seconds to pass verdict on content whether it was a one-line insult or a 30-minute video . “ If your auditor clicked in [ on a video ] two seconds later than you and he saw something different – he heard a different slur , or he saw something higher up the priority ladder – then bang , you 've made a wrong decision. ” Wrong decisions affect quality score , and quality score affects your employment . Despite this , the target for the office was a nigh-on impossible 98 % accuracy . Finding people to talk about their moderation experience is tough , as Block and Riesewieck found when looking for subjects . NDAs are universal , and the work comes under a codename – at the time of filming it was 'project honey badger ' . Despite this , Facebook – or the subcontractors that deal with moderation – hire quite openly , even if they ’ re often grossly misleading about what the job actually entails . “ They use superheroes in costumes , ‘ come be a superhero , clean up the internet ’ , ” explains Gabi Ivens , another Mozilla fellow on the panel . “ One advert in Germany for content moderators asked questions like ‘ do you love social media and wants to be up to date with what 's happening in the world ? ’ ” But despite the general tediousness of the day-to-day , there ’ s a surprising element to Block and Riesewieck ’ s documentary : many of their interview subjects took real pride in the role , seeing it as less of a job and more of a duty . “ They told us they feel like superheroes of the internet – like policemen guarding the internet , ” says Block . The directors credit this in part to the Philippines ’ 90 % Christian populous . “ They told us they feel like Jesus freeing the world from it , ” Block adds . This , in turn , might make people feel reluctant to walk away , seeing it as their ethical duty rather than just a job . But there are limits to this , especially as moderators aren ’ t making the final calls themselves . Here , the sacred text is Facebook ’ s labyrinthine set of rules and instructions : thousands of words accumulated over many years . In some cases , people are having to protect speech they think should be banned , or ban speech they think should be protected , something that Ivens sees as an obvious problem for wellbeing . “ Keeping content online that you don ’ t think should be online is extremely damaging , even before you think about what people are seeing . ” The irony to treating the rules as sacred is that Facebook ’ s rules have never been an infallible set text : they ’ re the results of years of iterative changes , gradually responding to crises as they emerge , and trying to make the subjective more objective . Keeping content online that you don ’ t think should be online is extremely damaging , even before you think about what people are seeing Remember the 'free the nipple ' campaign ? In short , Facebook guidelines originally said that any photograph with breasts in should be banned as pornographic , which meant the internet was deprived of proud mothers breastfeeding on the platform . Facebook gradually shifted its rules and accepted that context matters . In the same way , it ’ s had to accept that although there ’ s nothing illegal with people eating Tide Pods or spreading anti-vaccination conspiracy theories , if something becomes a public health epidemic , then it has a duty to step up . `` Some platforms say certain content might not be unlawful , but is unacceptable , ” explains Tsao . But “ other people feel like the internet should have broader freedoms to say whatever you want. ” For Facebook , this dichotomy produces absurd levels of granularity : “ Now we 've got some guidance on if you threaten to push somebody off a roof , ” Gray says . “ Pushing is not a violent action . The fact that you 're on a roof is important , but then how high is the roof ? ” So much for that “ don ’ t overthink ” guidance . This kind of inertia in moderation guidelines lets internet trolls thrive . You don ’ t have to look very hard to come up with examples of internet rabble rousers who step right up to the line without ever quite overstepping it . Instead , they leave that to their followers – and sometimes , catastrophically , that spills over into the real world . Facebook ’ s global status makes the problem even more complex because morality isn ’ t shared across borders . “ It 's complicated because it surpasses the local policies of countries and borders right into a wild west , ” Tsao says . Gray gives the example of people ’ s sexuality : gay pride is very much a thing in most of the west , but less so elsewhere in the world . You might tag a friend as gay in a post , and they ’ re comfortable enough with their sexuality to share it . So in that instance , it feels reasonable not to take the post down , even if a curmudgeonly homophobe complains about it . “ But then if you 're in Nigeria you could get you beaten or killed because somebody sees that post , ” he explains . “ That mistake could cost somebody their life . I mean , this is the reality of it : you are sometimes looking at life and death situations . ” Objective acts of violence should be more clear cut , but they aren ’ t . Video of a child getting shot might seem like an obvious candidate for deletion , but what if it ’ s citizen journalism uncovering unreported war crimes ? If Facebook takes that down , then isn ’ t it just the unwitting propaganda wing of the world ’ s worst despots ? This is the reality of it : you are sometimes looking at life and death situations This is complex , easily muddled and doesn ’ t help the workers who are being judged for their objective responses to subjective posts . “ People are protesting and it ’ s appearing on my desk , ” Gray says during the panel . “ And I ’ ve got to make the call : is that baby dead ? And then I ’ ve got to press the right button , and if I press the wrong button because my auditor thinks the baby ’ s not dead , then I ’ ve made a mistake and it goes towards my quality score and I get fired . “ So I ’ m lying awake in bed at night seeing that image again and trying to formulate an argument to keep my job . ” It should be pretty obvious at this point that this isn ’ t entirely Facebook ’ s fault , even if the company hasn ’ t exactly helped itself along the way . But what can it do ? It ’ s pretty clear throwing people at the problem won ’ t work , nor is AI moderation ready for show time . ( And there are legitimate doubts that it ever will be – for starters , you need humans to train the AI , which just moves trauma one step backwards . “ I think it 'll be really hard to completely remove humans from the loop , ” says Tsao . ) “ Facebook do n't have a clear strategy for this , ” says Gray . “ It 's all reactive . Something happens , so they make a new rule and hire more people. ” He believes a lack of leadership is the root of the problem . “ You need to know where you ’ re going with this and what your strategy is , and they don ’ t . Everything stems from that . ” That , Tsao believes , is in part because the decision makers haven ’ t had to do it themselves . “ I 've interviewed a bunch of heads of trust and safety at companies , and one of them has always said : ‘ if you 're going to be in a management role in this professional field , you have to understand what it 's like on the bottom ’ , ” she says . “ You have to understand the trauma , you have to understand what kind of support system is needed . ” Roderick Orner , a psychology professor from the University of Lincoln , has his own perspectives when we reach out to him . “ There is a duty of care . This doesn ’ t in any way guarantee that there aren ’ t going to be casualties amongst people who view this kind of material , but the company must be seen to have done everything reasonable to reduce risks to staff . Nobody should be doing this kind of work alone . And if it 's been done by a group then the thing that ’ s really important is strong group cohesion “ First of all , nobody should be doing this kind of work alone . And if it 's been done by a group then the thing that ’ s really important is strong group cohesion . It ’ s very important to arrange this in such a way that responsibility is not seen to be with the individual . ” Any company hiring for such “ dangerous work ” , Orner says , should have training so that employees can recognise the warning signs : “ a general sense of unease , not being able to relax after work , maybe being unduly preoccupied with certain images . And to be particularly watchful of whether sleep is adversely affected : with an accumulation of poor sleep , everything else feels much worse . ” Whether Facebook is interested in such insights is another matter . “ We don ’ t claim that all the fault is on the side of the companies – that ’ s not true ” says Block . “ The fault , we consider at least , is they don ’ t make it transparent , they don ’ t open the discussion and they don ’ t accept that they alone can ’ t decide about all that. ” Block and Riesewieck know that some Facebook employees have seen their film at a screening in San Francisco , and there was even talk of showing it at Facebook ’ s offices , only for follow-up emails to end up mysteriously unanswered . Certainly the NDA treatment isn ’ t helping , and the sheer quantity of ex- and current employees bound to them means the effect will inevitably lessen as there ’ s a certain safety in numbers . Gray hasn ’ t had any word from Facebook over breaking his – at least not directly . “ I had a call a couple of weeks ago from a former colleague… and they said ‘ Hey , I hear you ’ re being sued by Facebook ’ . No . Who told you I was being sued ? ‘ My team leader. ’ Your team leader is trying to manipulate you into silence . ” I do n't know if anything was ever done . You know , it just goes off into the void , it seems In other words , the carrot to stick balance feels as comically off as Facebook ’ s moderator to user ratio . Given people want to make the internet a better place , perhaps Facebook could tap into that sense of meaning ? Even Gray remembers feeling positive , recalling a text message he sent in the early days . “ I said ‘ I have personally escalated 13 cases of child abuse to the rapid response team , and I feel really good ’ . ” But it didn ’ t last . “ I never heard back from those people . I do n't know if anything was ever done . You know , it just goes off into the void , it seems . ” Could acknowledgement of making a difference boost morale ? Maybe , but only if they really are having an impact , Gray fairly interjects . “ Some kid in Afghanistan is tied to the bed naked and he 's being beaten . I escalate that because it 's it 's child sexual abuse , but what can anybody do ? “ I ’ m just following the policy , the person next level up is just deleting it . ”
Google just bought Fitbit for a cool $ 2.1 billion , but a new report suggests that Facebook was interested in picking up the wearables company as well – it just did n't offer as much money as Google did . According to The Information , Facebook got to the stage of having talks with Fitbit about a deal . Apparently Mark Zuckerberg and his executives only offered half of what Google was prepared to pay , though . If accurate , the report suggests Facebook is keen to keep expanding its hardware portfolio . The social media behemoth now develops video calling devices and bought Oculus VR for $ 2 billion back in 2014 . Now that Google is officially becoming part of Fitbit , we 're wondering what new hardware we might see in the future – could the long-rumored Pixel Watch finally make an appearance , with Fitbit tech inside . In announcing the news , Google did mention Made by Google hardware as well as Wear OS , so it looks like Google-branded wearables of some description are on the way . We might also see Fitbit 's own apps and software replaced by Wear OS and Google Fit . It 's still very early days though , so we 'll have to wait and see what happens to the current Fitbit devices and apps . We 'll also have to wait and see how Facebook 's hardware strategy develops – having a pile of fitness data to add to everything else it knows about us would certainly make sense for Facebook 's advertisers .

Millions of Facebook users may have had their personal details exposed for anyone to see online after experts discovered a major data breach . Security researchers found that as many as 267 million Facebook users may have had their details left open to hackers after a database containing their personal information was left unsecured on the web for nearly two weeks . Names , phone numbers and Facebook user IDs were among the details exposed , but no payment information is thought to have been put at risk . The breach was uncovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko along with Comparitech , who discovered an unsecured Elasticsearch database containing the user information . “ A database this big is likely to be used for phishing and spam , particularly via SMS , ” Diachenko said . “ Facebook users should be on the lookout for suspicious text messages . Even if the sender knows your name or some basic information about you , be skeptical of any unsolicited messages . ” Diachenko noted that the affected users were mainly from the US , with those who have not set their Facebook profiles to `` private '' thought to be most at risk . After discovering the database , him and the team at Comparitech alerted the ISP hosting the information , however it had been online for around two weeks before being taken down . It 's not clear how the information was stolen , but one possible theory is that hackers were able to compromise Facebook ’ s developer API , which is used by app makers to access user profiles and connected data . This is n't the first time Facebook has been accused of neglecting user privacy , with the social network currently fighting a lawsuit following an attack last year which left around 29 million user accounts open to hackers .

Facebook wants its own mobile operating system so hardware like its Oculus VR headsets is n't tied down by the limitations of Android . As reported by The Information , Facebook wants its own platform to avoid other companies throwing its plans off course , whether it 's built in-house or in partnership with another developer . `` We really want to make sure the next generation has space for us , ” said Andrew Bosworth , Facebook ’ s vice president of hardware , Andrew ‘ Boz ’ Bosworth . “ We don ’ t think we can trust the marketplace or competitors to ensure that ’ s the case . And so we ’ re gon na do it ourselves . ” The company told TechCrunch that it 's particularly interested in developing augmented reality glasses , and is exploring all options to make it a possibility on its own terms . This is n't the first time Facebook has considered creating its own operating system . Back in 2013 , one of the company 's senior developers revealed that it had considered developing an OS for Facebook Home – a project that replaced your phone 's usual home screen with something based around social features . Facebook considered building an OS from scratch or creating an Android fork before settling on an interface layer that sat on top of Android and simply changed its regular interface . The app received negative reviews , and was abandoned within months of its release . `` The OS path was the least fleshed-out of the paths , '' director of mobile engineering Cory Ondrejka said . `` Mark [ Zuckerberg ] talked on launch day that he wanted to build something for everyone . It 's hard to get to the type of scale that 's necessary for us [ when building an OS ] . We wanted Home in front of hundreds of millions of people – even a successful OS would only give that experience to a few of them . '' However , now that Facebook has extended its reach beyond phones to other hardware , it makes sense for it to revisit the idea . Facebook has no plans to end development of its iOS and Android apps , but it 'll be interesting to see where this new project leads and whether its new direction proves more successful than Facebook Home .

In the days of Farmville , Facebook gaming was all the rage , with incessant notifications hitting the giant social network 's users ' inboxes , asking them to tend crops or join a game of Words With Friends . Now , Facebook is looking to recapture that golden age of browser gaming with a new acquisition : PlayGiga , a cloud gaming startup . It could help Facebook enter the increasingly-competitive space currently occupied by Google Stadia , Nvidia GeForce Now and the upcoming Microsoft Project xCloud . Facebook has yet to official detail its intentions for PlayGiga , but finance publication Cinco Días suggests PlayGiga may have been acquired for 70 million Euros ( around $ 78 million ) . We ’ re thrilled to welcome @ PlayGigaOficial to the Facebook Gaming team . We ’ ll decline further c☁️mment for now.December 18 , 2019 PlayGiga has previously offered a cloud gaming service in the Middle East and Europe , and its statement following the news at least points to a continuation of its cloud gaming push . It said `` We are continuing our work in cloud gaming , now with a new mission . '' Though Facebook made waves among the core gaming community with its Oculus VR purchase , Facebook 's last concerted effort in the browser gaming space was the launch of Instant Games back in 2016 . It offered its titles on similar principles to what we now expect from cloud gaming services , requiring no downloads and access to games across devices . But these were limited to HTML5 games . PlayGiga could potentially offer resource-intensive AAA titles that gamers crave . The social network , which has had a rocky few years in terms of public perception , certainly already has one of the biggest challenges facing an upstart gaming company covered off already – users . It 's networking tools , privacy considerations aside , are second to none , and you could easily imagine a cloud gaming system that taps into your Friends list and lets you instantly jump into a session with a group of pals .

There 's already a Facebook dark mode , but just in time for the launch of Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker ( and capitalizing on the ongoing dark mode trend ) , Facebook has rolled out a new theme for its Messenger app inspired by the dark side of the Force . Unlike most dark modes , this one is n't intended to conserve battery life or relieve eye strain ; it 's just for fun . In addition to a star-scattered wallpaper , you get a set of Star Wars emoji , cartoon stickers , and augmented reality filters to liven up video calls and selfies . Facebook says that the theme is 'limited edition ' , but has n't clarified exactly what that means . It seems likely that it 'll remain as part of the app until some point int he new year , once excitement about the new movie has died down . The new theme is rolling out worldwide right now . To enable it , make sure you have the latest version of Facebook Messenger from the App Store or Google Play , then open a chat ( or start a new one ) and tap its name at the top of the screen . If you 've received the update , you should see a 'Theme ' option at the top to access the new Star Wars design . If you ca n't see the option , you may have to wait a little longer for it to arrive , but you should get it well before the new film launches on December 19 . Looking forward to The Rise of Skywalker , but want to refresh your memory first ? Check out our guide to how to watch the Star Wars films in order .

Ahead of an upcoming senate hearing on encryption , Facebook executives have sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr in which they said that the social media giant would not provide law enforcement with access to its encrypted messaging products . In the letter , written by WhatsApp head Will Cathcart and Messengerhead Stan Chudnovsky , the executives explained that by creating backdoor access into Facebook 's products for law enforcement , the would also be giving cybercriminals and other bad actors a way to enter their systems , saying : “ The ‘ backdoor ’ access you are demanding for law enforcement would be a gift to criminals , hackers and repressive regimes , creating a way for them to enter our systems and leaving every person on our platforms more vulnerable to real-life harm . People ’ s private messages would be less secure and the real winners would be anyone seeking to take advantage of that weakened security . That is not something we are prepared to do . ” Facebook 's CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced earlier this year that the company would be bringing end-to-end encryption to both Messenger and WhatsApp to make both of the apps “ faster , simpler , more private and more secure ” . However , in October the Justice Department raised concerns about the company 's encryption plans and suggested they would benefit criminals such as sex traffickers and pedophiles . Barr insisted that law enforcement should have access to company 's systems in order to investigate these serious crimes , saying : “ Companies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content even for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes ” . The letter from Facebook executives was sent in response to Barr 's inquiry in October and it arrived just before a Senate Judiciary hearing on encryption . During that hearing , Chairman Lindsey Graham said that while he appreciates that cybercriminals ca n't hack into his smartphone , he still believes encrypted devices and messaging apps create a “ safe haven ” for criminals . Facebook 's director of messaging privacy Jay Sullivan then argued that American companies must lead when it comes to secure and encrypted messaging or foreign firms would take up the mantle . If this occurred , it would be even more difficult for US law enforcement officials to gain access to these services to conduct investigations . The war for encryption continues and expect this issue to be debated heavily as governments try to protect their citizens from criminals and other threats while continuing to take away their privacy online .

Facebook has launched a new tool which allows you to easily transfer your photos and videos to another service , although it ’ s only available to folks in Ireland initially – although a wider rollout will happen soon enough . This is a feature a lot of people will appreciate , allowing users to conveniently transfer all their Facebook photos and video clips to a third-party service , and the first choice available is to shift media across to Google Photos , with more options to follow . Privacy and security are key considerations , the social media giant notes , so the data transfer process will involve encryption , and users are asked for a password before a transfer can take place . Facebook says that this photo transfer tool is rolling out from today , although it ’ s still being tested , and will be further honed based on feedback from users . As mentioned , the utility is currently only available to those in Ireland , with wider ( worldwide ) availability planned for the first half of 2020 . You can find the new tool under Facebook settings within Your Facebook Information . Facebook notes that this is all part of a drive for data portability , and that the transfer tool is based on code developed through the company ’ s participation in the open source Data Transfer Project ( launched by Google back in 2018 , with partners including Facebook and Twitter , as well as Microsoft and Apple ) . The social media firm observed : “ At Facebook , we believe that if you share data with one service , you should be able to move it to another . That ’ s the principle of data portability , which gives people control and choice while also encouraging innovation . ”
