AMD has posted a $ 1.18 billion ( £727m ) profit for the last quarter of 2009 – with Intel 's blockbuster payment of $ 1.25 billion ( £770 ) giving the company a huge year-on-year turnaround . Intel paid out the whopping figure to bring an end to legal action over its tactics in keeping market dominance , and without that money AMD would have dropped back into the red for the quarter . But even taking that into account , the report represents a huge turnaround year on year , the last quarter of 2008 saw a $ 1.4 billion loss ( £863m ) . Positive It 's a positive sign for AMD which has done superbly with its DirectX 11 cards – getting to market well ahead of its rival Nvidia , which has yet to start selling its own DX11 wares . `` AMD 's quarter marks another milestone in our transformation and underscores our growing momentum , '' says AMD Chief Executive Dirk Meyer . `` We 're pleased with our progress .

Intel has officially announced its Intel Core 13 and Core i5 processors – among 10 new chipsets , 25 new processors , 802.11n Wi-Fi and Wimax products with new Intel My WiFi features and introduced its 32 nanometre offerings . Intel 's announcements hardly come as a shock , but are important with the introduction of new Intel Core i7 , i5 and i3 chips coinciding with the arrival of Intel 's groundbreaking new 32 nm manufacturing process . `` Intel is unveiling several platform products , including more than 25 processors , wireless adapters and chipsets , including new Intel Core i7 , i5 and i3 processors , Intel 5 Series Chipsets , and Intel Centrino Wi-Fi and WiMAX adapters that include new Intel My WiFi features , '' says Intel 's release . `` More than 400 laptop and desktop PC platform designs are expected from computer makers based on these products , with another 200 expected for embedded devices . '' Adapt to user 's needs `` For the first time , there 's a new family of Intel processors with the industry 's most advanced technology available immediately at virtually every PC price point , '' said Sean Maloney , executive vice president and general manager of the Intel Architecture Group . `` These smart processors adapt to an individual 's needs , automatically providing a 'boost ' of performance for everyday applications . `` They become energy efficient to the point of shutting down processing cores or reducing power consumption to provide performance when people need it , and energy efficient when they do n't . '' The Intel Centrino brand now represents Intel 's wireless products with three new Intel Centrino Wireless adapters feature advanced 802.11n multi-stream capabilities and dual-band support for WiFi , offering users 'up to 8 times greater speed , consistent coverage and reliable connectivity while consuming minimal power ' . All the adapters support Intel My WiFi Technology , which allows users to turn their laptop into a hotspot and directly connect wireless devices to their laptop .
During his keynote at CES Intel 's CEO Paul Otellini said that while computing was evolving and becoming about more than the PC , connectivity was key to this change . `` Smartphones truly embody personal computing , '' Otellini said . `` Wireless connectivity is critical and 3G is great , but it 's not fast enough . 4G technologies like WiMAX are needed to deliver on the promise and potential of these new devices . '' Otellini demonstrated 4G technology that has been on show at CES and continued to preach the message about Wimax – he stated that 700 million people will be covered by WiMAX by the end of 2010 . `` Computing in the home is rapidly expanding beyond the PC , '' Otellini said . `` The TV will continue to be a focal point of the home while becoming smarter , much in the way phones are evolving into smartphones . New user interfaces and forms of connectivity will change the way we interact with entertainment in the home . '' Intel 's CEO also welcomed the advent of 3D in the home and cinemas , saying that creating 3D content requires a `` ton of computing power . '' Otellini also said there are some powerful PCs available today that are capable of creating 3D content at home . To prove his point , he demonstrated real-time creation and editing of 3D using a Core i7 PC . In a move to combat the rise of Android running on ARM-based devices , Otellini also announced the beta launch of an app store for Atom-based devices called the Intel AppUp Center and said that Acer , Asus , Dell and Samsung have already pledged support . The announcement follows on from the Atom Developer Program that was launched back in the Autumn . Otellini also described how advancements in microprocessor technology will continue to transform how people enjoy media at home . He showed new ways to visually search for TV shows , internet access to videos and other applications on a yet-to-be introduced Orange media set-top box powered by the Intel Atom CE4100 system on a chip .

Nokia and Intel 's partnership announcement hinted at a shift for the Finnish firm - popping Intel 's technology in its high end devices . The new MeeGo OS will , according to Intel , help create a new range of tablets , netbooks and similar devices - and Nokia said that it might be looking at using Intel in other areas too . When quizzed on whether we 'll see Intel chips in a Nokia phone ( which traditionally use ARM architecture ) Nokia 's Kai Öistämö offered a fairly open hint a tie up is on the cards . `` Nokia is always working with the best companies , in both hardware and software , so it 's natural that we 'll pick the best hardware available . '' You mean us , right ? It would be pretty harsh on Intel to make reference to a competitor 's chipset as 'the best ' , so we can assume that this may be the case . Nokia and Intel announced a tie-in last year , although were pretty sketchy on the details beyond saying it would release a family of 'pocket friendly ' devices . Intel also pointed out that this deal wo n't be affecting its relationship with Microsoft , stating that MeeGo is : `` focused on new devices , with different mobile experiences , which is very different to what Microsoft is addressing today . `` They 're working the PC market , and that 's very well addressed by Windows . That 's not what we 're after here [ with the MeeGo announcement ] .
Intel and Nokia are merging their Moblin and Maemo software platforms . The announcement , made at a specially arranged Mobile World Congress press event , will create a unified and completely open source Linux-based platform that will `` run on multiple hardware platforms across a wide range of computing devices ... and significantly increase opportunities for developers '' . Called MeeGo , the open software platform `` will accelerate industry innovation and time-to-market for a wealth of new Internet-based applications and services and exciting user experiences . '' MeeGo-based devices from Nokia and other manufacturers are expected to launch with a UK release date in the second half this year . Far from being a competitor , Nokia insisted MeeGo will `` coexist and complement '' Symbian during the press conference . `` Our vision for seamlessly communicating between computing devices from the home , auto , office or your pocket is taking a big step forward today with the introduction of MeeGo , '' said Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini . `` This is a foundational step in our evolving relationship with Nokia . The merging of these two important assets into an open source platform is critical toward providing a terrific experience across a variety of devices and gaining crossindustry support . ''

Google has teamed up with Intel and Sony to develop a platform called Google TV , which aims bring the web into the living room through new TVs and set-top boxes . The Android-based system should allow people to perform connected tasks like updating and browsing Facebook , Tweeting or getting their favoured news feeds through RSS . The move makes a lot of sense , with connected televisions proliferating and both Intel and Google desperate to translate their dominance in computing into the burgeoning entertainment device market . Sony developing new TV brand ? Sony has also seen its market share slipping in the TV industry in recent years , so is in need of new technologies to give its TV and home cinema products and brands a new edge . Of course , web access via the television is nothing new and there are already a number of TVs on the market that will let you surf the net , although the services are somewhat limited in scope at this point in time . Google 's plan is to open up its Android-based TV platform to developers to try to create a similar ecosystem to that seen in apps for smartphones over the last few years . `` Google is expected to deliver a toolkit to outside programmers within the next couple of months , and products based on the software could appear as soon as this summer , '' claims a report in The New York Times this week . Logitech remote ? Logitech has apparently been approached to make peripherals for Google TV , including a remote with a tiny keyboard . Specific details on the Google TV project are scarce , with the various deals still under negotiation . `` Google wants to be everywhere the Internet is so they can put ads there , '' one source with knowledge of the project told the NYT . Google TV software will be open source so that device and TV makers will have easy and open access to it . Interestingly , the New York Times report also hints that Sony may well be developing a new TV brand to launch the technology under . Via New York Times

Instead of cracking open your PC to add extra memory , how about plugging it into a docking station that also gives you a faster processor so you can run more demanding applications ? Once PCs switch over to internal optical connections based on silicon photonics instead of the copper wires that run around today 's motherboards , `` we 'll have a new way to design that gets rid of the distance limit , '' says Sean Koehl , a technology evangelist in Intel Labs . `` You can move the memory . Take a very mobile device like a netbook and imagine a docking station that also gives it a connection to faster processing and more memory . '' That could help with cooling ; your notebook could get more powerful without getting hotter . Memory on your PC is going to get faster as well , he says . `` Memory bandwidth is very important and we 're working on 3D stacking ; the signals are going a shorter distance , the circuits they 're driving are much simpler and we get a clean signal compared to the noisy , distorted signal we have to deal with when we 're making the connection across the motherboard today . '' Koehl also expects stacking one memory call on top of another to need less power as well as improving the connections between memory chips . Put it all together , suggests Koehl , and you get memory that 's ten times more efficient than today 's DRAMs . The future of software Koehl spends his time thinking about what PCs will do in five to ten years ' time to work out what Intel needs to design into chips to run them : `` we need to understand the future of software so we understand what hardware to build ; for example do we need to add more cache memory ? '' Several of the projects he 's interested in are about model-based computing . Sometimes that 's actual models , as in the research Intel Labs in China is doing to create 3D objects from a series of digital photos ; think Microsoft Photosynth running on your own PC , making 3D copies of real objects that you can use in virtual world . It needs 25-30 photographs from a standard digital camera , rather than special equipment and you do n't need to position the camera precisely or give the software details of how far away the camera was from the object ; the system calculates all that . Today it takes a trained 3D artist to make a good model ; in the future Koehl suggests it 's going to be as easy as writing a blog post . STEP BY STEP : Take the photos and one day your PC will make the 3D model The same process could make a realistic avatar of your head that can keep changing expression by tracking your actual face through your webcam . The software combines the 3D model it generates from the photos with generic models of faces ( automatically derived from scanning thousands of photos , so the system learns , for instance , that mouths move but noses do n't ) . GO 3D : In the lab Intel can work out where the camera that took a photo was Models could also help you drive more safely , or even let your PC drive your car : Intel is working with Neustar in China on a Larrabee-based in-car system that could identify pedestrians and other cars on the road . `` In the long term , '' hopes Koehl , `` it could lead to automated cars that drive themselves safely – or at least pull over safely if you fall asleep at the wheel !

Sony , Google and Intel are teaming up to bring Google to TVs , with official news on the project set to be announced next month . We announced back in March that Sony was working with Intel to bring Google TV to the masses and now it seems that there will be more news on this in May . The three companies in question are planning to meet up for a conference 19-20 May – organised by Google – to speak about upcoming projects . Details on what exactly they will be unveiling are scarce but the rumour mill is busy producing enough grain to bake a massive Google TV-shaped cake . Enter the Dragonpoint Bloomberg is reporting that the Sony TVs will be equipped with a customised version of the Atom chip codenamed Dragonpoint and the TV will run a modified version of the Google Android OS . Logitech is also reportedly working on a keyboard that also is a remote control to go alongside the television , so do n't go thinking that Google are coming up with a keyboard-less revolutionary search method for its TV debut . Sony is n't the only company in talks with Google , the likes of Samsung are also said to be looking at creating their very own Google box . Via Akihabaranews

Intel 's new Classmate PC hardware features an updated version of the Atom processor series , an Atom N450 at 1.66GHz , with optional GPS , Bluetooth , 3G and WiMax connectivity . The new Classmate PC will be branded as the FizzbookSpin in the UK . Tristan Wilkinson , Head of Public Sector , Intel EMEA , said of the new machine : `` The new classmate PC design is based on extensive research from over 30 pilot classrooms around the world looking at how students learn , how they use and engage with technology , and how teaching has evolved . The new classmate PC is durable and lightweight , with additional ergonomic features such as rubberized surface for easy grip and a comfortable , low-profile handle that supports a variety of holding and carrying positions . `` Equipping students with the best learning tools from an early age will open up opportunities for them in life and work . We are committed to providing comprehensive technology solutions , which both support teachers in the classroom and provide the best learning environment for students . '' Touch-sensitive tablet PC The new Classmate hardware comes with hard drives up to 160GB and also features a touch-sensitive 1366x768 10.1-inch screen . Interestingly the screen can also rotate or lie flat , effectively turning the new Classmate into a tablet PC . The device also comes with an accelerometer that ensures what is showing on the screen is in line with the screen 's orientation . Intel claims are that users should get 8.5 hours of operation on a full charge of the Classmate 's battery . Intel clearly sees the primary education sector in emerging markets as a huge potential growth area for its low-cost Classmate technology . Via Ars Technica

AMD , the PC processor industry 's perennial second stringer , is tooling up to release its long awaited CPU-GPU `` Fusion '' processor . It has all the makings of an Intel killer , particularly in mobile trim for laptop PCs . Codenamed Llano and due out early next year , key advantages include a single-die fusion architecture and graphics power an order of magnitude greater than any previous integrated solution . About time , too . While Intel rolls out advanced new PC processor architectures on a seemingly weekly basis , the current culmination of which is a six-core monster , AMD is almost nowhere to be seen . Arguably , it has n't released a properly new processor since 2003 . That 's about to change . The fight back begins later this month with Thuban , AMD 's six-core effort . However , Thuban is just a six-core rehash of AMD 's current processor technology . Interesting addition to the meaty mid-range CPU market though it may well be , it wo n't worry Intel . Instead , it will be Llano that marks AMD 's real renaissance and the beginning of a danger period for Intel . AMD has been trickle-charging us with info on Llano in recent months . Turns out it 's not quite the chip we were expecting . In some ways it 's actually a disappointment . But as an overall package , it 's shaping up to be potentially lethal . Crucially , Llano combines a conventional PC processor and a full-function graphics core in a single slice of silicon . Intel , of course , already has a CPU-GPU hybrid processor on sale in the form of its Arrandale and Clarkdale processors . Strange branding They 're sold variously as Core i3 , i5 and i7 processors depending on the target form factor , price segment and apparently which way the wind is blowing . There 's little logic to Intel 's current PC processor branding scheme . More importantly , Intel 's CPU-GPU chips are not full-on fusion products . Crack open the CPU package ( highly inadvisable if you want to keep using it ) and you 'll find not one but two individual processor dies . That 's Intel 's way of getting fusion to market faster and with fewer risks . But it 's also architecturally suboptimal . Enter therefore Llano , the real single-die fusion deal and with it the promise of that rarest of things for AMD - a competitive advantage . First up is Llano 's intriguing integrated graphics core . It 's absolutely huge . Exactly how huge in terms of the all-important stream processor count we ca n't say for sure . AMD has n't divulged the hard numbers . However , AMD has teased us with a few photographs of Llano which in turn reveal that the graphics core consumes nigh on 50 per cent of the entire die . We also know that Llano will be built on AMD 's upcoming 32nm chip production process and will enjoy a total transistor budget around the one billion mark . Put those facts together and you 're looking at an integrated graphics solution with a probable stream processor count somewhere north of 400 units . Not all that impressive in the context of AMD 's monstrous 1,600-stream-processor-strong desktop GPU , the Radeon HD 5870 . But remember , AMD 's fastest current integrated graphics core sports just 40 stream processors . Admittedly , there are doubts regarding Llano 's ability to feed that graphics core with data . GPUs are extremely data hungry and it 's not yet clear whether the CPU and GPU parts will share a single memory bus and if so what that bus will look like . As for the conventional CPU half of Llano , it 's based on AMD 's current Stars processor architecture . Four cores , each with 1MB of L2 cache and a few tweaks to what is a rather ancient architecture will be your lot . That 's a little bit of a bummer given that AMD had originally planned to use a brand new CPU architecture for its first Fusion product .

MeeGo has been given its first proper outing at Intel 's Developer Forum in Beijing . While Nokia and Intel announced the merger of Moblin and Maemo back at Mobile World Congress in February , there were no demos at the event and only minimal details . So here are some screenshots of the OS , courtesy of Engadget . We know what you 're thinking – Windows Phone 7 . And we 'd have to agree , the furniture does look very similar to Microsoft 's new mobile OS . However , because these screenshots are from a device such as the Nokia N900 , there 's a lot more screen real estate then there would be on a traditional mobile handset . Also scroll down for a vid of MeeGo in action on a netbook . Nokia told TechRadar at Mobile World Congress that MeeGo was very much orientated towards mobile computing devices such as the N900 rather than standard mobile phones and that MeeGo was n't trying to pull the rug from under Symbian . The joint venture has n't been slow to attract support - Acer , Asus , BMW , EA Mobile , Gameloft , Novell , PixArt , Red Flag , ST-Ericsson , Tencent , TurboLinux , VietSoftware , Wind River , WTEC , and Xandros are among the extensive list namechecked by Intel . `` Acer was an enthusiastic adopter of Moblin and we 're excited about Moblin 's evolution into the MeeGo software platform , '' said Jim Wong , senior corporate vice president and president of IT Products Global Operations at Acer . `` We 're looking forward to ecosystem innovation that will be enabled by the open nature of MeeGo . '' S.Y . Shian , vice president and general manager of Notebook Business Unit at Asus added . `` As the netbook market grows , Asus is continually exploring offerings that optimize this computing experience and address the specific needs of today 's netbook customers . '' The first release of MeeGo is expected in the second quarter of this year with applications available in both Intel 's AppUp Center and Nokia 's Ovi Store . Via Engadget .

Intel has previewed its upcoming 'Tunnel Creek ' System-on-Chip ( SoC ) tech for in-vehicle-infotainment systems for cars . Interestingly , the demo - on a vehicle designed by Chinese car maker HawTai and based on the Queensbay platform - was running MeeGo , Intel 's now joint venture OS with Nokia . The forthcoming SoC hardware features an Intel Atom processor core that will directly connect to other third-party devices via the PCI Express standard , saving on cost . Queensbay is , essentially , a later version of the company 's Menlow platform . The Tunnel Creek SoC combines the processor core , memory controller hub , graphics engine and video engine into one chip and because of the PCI Express compatibility could link to other technologies such as Nvidia 's Ion graphics chip . The hardware could also be used for other applications such as IP telephony , says Intel . Dian Ming , vice chairman of HawTai Automotive , was predictably enthusiastic about the new hardware . `` It saves us application development costs , and enables new services to be introduced quickly with high reliability . '' `` With an infotainment solution that utilises the Intel Atom processor , we are leveraging the well-established and latest internet technologies , and re-using existing software that has been developed on [ the ] MeeGo based Linux platform , '' said Mr Wang . Frugal power use Energy efficiency is another key theme of this IDF . Intel Chief Technology Officer and managing director of Intel Labs , Justin Rattner , discussed how smarter technology can reduce and better manage energy consumption . `` Consumer empowerment is critical , '' said Rattner . `` If we can make energy more personalised with real-time information and offer visual tools that engage entire communities , it will lead to valuable changes in behavior and save staggering amounts of energy . '' Intel researchers have invented a new wireless device to make the collection of energy data easy and inexpensive for consumers . The experimental sensor needs to be plugged into your home 's electrical wiring to measure and wirelessly report the power consumption of each electrical load . Intel has also been talking up the `` connected computing experience '' where all devices share information ( if only ) . `` With an additional 1 billion connected computing users by 2015 and with more types of devices there is value in providing a common experience between the devices , '' said David ( Dadi ) Perlmutter , executive vice president and co-general manager , Intel Architecture Group . `` Intel architecture delivers the right combination of performance and power that provides the foundation across all computing devices creating a virtual continuum of computing to enable this common user experience .

Dual-core Atom processors for netbooks could be coming soon from Intel , according to the company 's president Paul Otellini . Intel has had its best start to the year ever , with a huge increase in profit showing that the economic difficulties have not stopped people investing in their computers . Speaking as the results were announced , Otellini said : `` the next innovation coming out on Atom is dual core , which comes out in the second quarter . '' With dual-core Atoms already being used in small media computers or nettops , to merit such an announcement it seems likely that the forthcoming chips are for netbooks . Quarter masters Intel announced a 400 percent increase in year-on-year quarterly profit , raking in $ 2.4 billion ( £1.55bn ) and producing a profit of 43 cents a share – significantly more than analyst predictions . The company cited that it was huge growth in its mobile microprocessor revenue that was responsible for the good news . Of course , Intel 's Atom chips remain dominant in the burgeoning netbook market , and the company has traditionally been very strong in laptops , despite competition from rival AMD . Intel is also looking forward to some key additions to its offering in the coming months , including the Moorestown platform and the dual-core Atoms that have got the mobile computing world humming .

If you have been toying with the idea of investing in an ultrathin MacBook Air , but have so far not succumbed to the temptation , then the news that Intel is set to launch a new line of processors for ultra-skinny laptops may well be of interest . Intel has announced its new line of Ultra-Low Voltage Core processors , lower-voltage versions of its current Core i3 , i5 and i7 processors currently used in MacBooks and HP 's range of high-end Envy laptops . Intel 's new ULV Core chips should improve battery life by 15 per cent and give a 15 per cent improvement in power efficiency , as well as allowing for a 30 per cent reduction in thickness . So we may even see newer ranges of super-thin laptops even thinner than the current batch on the market . Intel also says that the new processors ' Turbo Boost Technology and Hyper-Threading Technology means no drop in performance in comparison with its current Core processors . The new chips also include HD video decoding , meaning ( we hope ) no more glitchy video viewing on your netbooks or your ultraslim laptops in the future . Intel promises the first batch of laptops using its new ULV Core CPUs will be available next month . So we will be sure to be watching the announcements from Intel 's partners – including Acer , Asus , Lenovo , and MSI – at Computex in Taipei in early June . Via Fastcompany.com

Intel is already planning for the devices of 2015 , with the chip giant telling TechRadar that it keeps its concepts of the future grounded in immutable habits of everyday life . Intel 's Wendy March , a people and practices expert who works in the future technoogies research branch of Intel labs , explained that silison development is still a slow process , which means that Intel has to look ahead . `` We 're looking at least five years ahead , but often in the five to 10 year span , '' she said . `` That starts to be a little strange because what 's really going to happen in five years , even beyond three years , is quite hard to predict . `` But the development of silicon is a slow process we do plan a long way out for that . '' The lunch of 2015 Intel Labs is already thinking about the world of 2015 , but the company is keen to ground its research in the knowledge that people 's everyday lives will not change that dramatically . `` Quite recently we were working with planners and architects for our architecture for 2014 and 2015 and thinking 'what will everyday life be like ? ' '' added March . `` I think it 's a very interesting balance that we bring from our ethnographic process in grounding future concepts in real life environments . `` Even in five years we 're likely to still be having lunch so if you think about what your day is going to look like there are still certain things that you will be doing that you will want to do , but the way you are going to be doing them and the devices that are going to support you will be different , and that 's what we think about . '' Social trends March explains that planning for future devices and services is more about keeping an eye on social trends , rather than trying to back a particular technology horse . `` Most of [ tech development ] is evolutionary , '' said March . `` You can see certain trends happening , but there are shifts happening ; there are technologies that just appear out of nowhere that you ca n't predict . `` So Facebook comes up and you are like 'oh , well who 'd have known ? ' `` We 're not crystal ball gazers ; we ca n't say in five years this is definitively going to happen , but we can see the way that tech starts to unfold and the way in which some social trends are happenings .

Intel has laid all its cards on the table and announced that the new series of 'smart TVs ' will be as important to the evolution of televisions as colour was . While the rest of the tech industry is currently pandering to the 'new ' technology that is 3D , Intel CEO Paul Otellini is betting big on web-based tellies being the future of where our viewing is going . Speaking at an investors ' day , Otellini noted : `` The TV revolution we 're about to go through is the biggest change since the move to colour . `` The usage model is going to fundamentally shift with the new capabilities of the platform . '' In short he was talking about Intel 's Atom platform which is set to power these Smart TVs . Atom powered The chip which will be under the hood is the Atom processor CE4100 which will start populating set-top boxes and offer everything from widgets to web TV . The chips are set to power a Linux-based OS and support Flash . Intel is said to be in discussion with Sony to develop a Google TV platform , which may launch as soon as the summer . Via V3.co.uk

Intel has announced its Atom Z6XX series – the chip giant 's first big roll of the dice for the smartphone market . The good news is that the chip looks storming in terms of performance and is very power efficient . The bad news ? Intel has named no names in terms of handset manufacturers who might deploy the new silicon , formerly codenamed Moorestown . However , it did show off an Aava Mobile reference device completely powered by Intel hardware during a launch event attended by TechRadar . The silicon will run the Android OS as well as Intel 's joint Linux venture with Nokia , MeeGo . Support for other operating systems was clearly hinted at . Given Nokia 's closeness to Intel , we reckon we 'll see Symbian running on it before too long . The second-generation Atom also `` scales very well up to tablets ... you 're going to see a number of different ways these products will be used , '' said Rob O'Shea , Director of Intel 's EMEA Embedded Group , as he presented the key specs of the new device . Crucially , Intel is citing a 50 times power reduction – equating to a 10 day standby time – over the first generation of the Menlow UMPC Atom platform . Intel was keen to show this with a real-time power consumption demo , shown here . The old Menlow Atom platform is the red line , while the new Moorestown platform is the blue line - both are measurements taken at full stretch . The barely visible green line is Moorestown at idle power . Intel also demonstrated three-way video conferencing running live on the hardware ( encoding one as well as decoding two other streams ) , as well as Quake 3 and 1080p HD video decoding - the device can encode 720p . `` With these kind of power reductions , we are in the smartphone zone . We are in the game , '' said Pankaj Kedia , Intel Director of Mobile Internet Devices . We 'll bring you more from Pankaj Kedia in a separate piece on TechRadar . Comparisons to other handsets The smartphone version of the chip will reach 1.5GHz , while a second , tablet-orientated version will ship for tablets.Some graphs were shown comparing the performance of the new Atom to the ARM Cortex-A8 and other unidentified mobile handsets . While these graphs were convincingly in the Atom 's favour , it was unfortunate that the Cortex-A8 looked at was only clocked at 600GHz and the handsets were unidentified - worth taking with a pinch of salt . Intel also showed graphs claiming a 3-4x JavaScript browsing speed improvement over competitors , though there are so many variables within this it 's hard to take the numbers that seriously until we see shipping devices . The 140 million transistor SoC ( System On Chip ) component – is 45nm technology , although Intel was openly looking ahead to producing Atom using the 32nm and 22nm processes . Intel believes its key advantage is that its architecture is already well established . `` It 's a computer that enables voice , '' Kedia said of Intel 's hardware , `` [ It 's ] the [ level ] of experience you expect to find on a PC . '' `` If you can deliver great graphics and video , you can scale that up into very slim tablets . We can design where we have to have that discipline up . '' Just to be clear , Moorestown is the platform , As well as the Z6XX variant of the Atom ( codenamed Lincroft SoC ) also controlling graphics memory and display , the platform includes a Platform Controller Hub ( MP20 , codenamed Langwell ) . The platform also includes wireless and other hardware from the likes of Freescale , Ericsson and Marvell , though the exact implementation of this will presumably depend on the handset manufacturer .

Intel has confirmed that it will create a native version of Android 2.2 that will run on devices sporting the Atom chipsets . Intel 's Renee James told APCmag.com that an X86 version of Android 2.2 – codenamed FroYo – would be available for developers this summer . `` Our expectation is that ( native x86 Android ) will be based on the Froyo release and will be available this summer to developers , '' said James . Mobile OS The adapted mobile OS would be fully open sourced in time , with James adding that the development to date `` was n't tremendously difficult , as we have a lot experience in Linux '' . Of course , Intel 's project will be seen as a competitor to Windows 7 on netbooks and portable devices , but people will also be looking at the forthcoming Chrome OS . Chrome OS – a real attempt at an OS for mobile computers that is optimised for the cloud – should be on devices by the end of 2010 or beginning of 2011 . With Android and Chrome OS devices arriving to compete with the deservedly popular Windows 7 – the real winner is set to be the consumer . APCMag via Eurodroid.com

Chip giant Intel has purchased the wireless chip division of Germany 's Infineon for £900 million . Infineon is perhaps best known to consumers as the company that makes the chips used by Apple in its iPhones . The deal follows Intel 's £4.9 billion purchase of McAfee earlier this month , the US security software company . Intel aims for smartphones Both deals are part and parcel of Intel moving its business away from its traditional core of producing CPUs for personal computers , into newer growth markets such as security and mobile/wireless . Intel downgraded its sales outlook last week , noting that consumer demand for computers was slowing in what it sees to be a slower-than-expected recovery for the worldwide PC market . The company reduced its expected third-quarter revenues to $ 11bn , down from an estimated $ 11.6bn forecast only six weeks ago . Intel 's latest purchase of Infineon 's wireless unit will allow the company to boost its position in the fast-growing smartphone market . The mobile unit will remain as a standalone business , according to statements issued by both Infineon and Intel . `` Infineon would make Intel an instant heavyweight ( in the mobile space ) and buy them three , four years in R & D , '' IDC analyst Flint Pulskamp told Reuters .

Intel CEO Paul Otellini says that the proposed acquisition of security giant McAfee will enable Intel to innovate across all three key pillars of computing . `` Over the past couple of decades there have been a few critically important inflexions in computing [ such as the internet and rise of the personal computer ] and we now live in a world of multiple devices , '' said Otellini during a conference call to announce the McAfee deal . `` Growing alongside [ this ] is the frequency of security attacks . The number of new threats continues to rise , '' he added . `` As a result , we have concluded that security has become the third pillar of computing after energy efficient performance and internet connectivity . '' Hence the decision to purchase McAfee . `` We believe this [ acquisition ] will better protect devices for our users . It allows Intel to innovate over all three pillars of computing . '' `` The addition of McAfee products and technologies into the Intel computing portfolio brings us incredibly talented people with a track record of delivering security innovations , products and services that the industry and consumers trust to make connecting to the internet safer and more secure , '' Otellini stated . Intel says the acquisition `` enables a combination of security software and hardware from one company to ultimately better protect consumers , corporations and governments as billions of devices - and the server and cloud networks that manage them - go online '' . If it goes through , McAfee will become a wholly owned but separate subsidiary of Intel costing in the region of $ 7.7 billion . McAfee will report into Intel 's Software and Services Group . Both boards of directors have unanimously approved the deal , which is expected to close after McAfee shareholder approval , regulatory clearances and other customary conditions have been met . McAfee is the world 's largest dedicated security technology company with 6,100 employees based in Santa Clara .
Intel has agreed to acquire anti-virus giant McAfee for $ 7.68 billion ( £4.9bn ) . The PC security market is in a strange place following the decision of Microsoft to offer free security software , but Intel have nevertheless decided that McAfee is ripe for purchase . The chip giant will buy all of McAfee 's stock at $ 48 per share in cash . Final approval pending The deal has been apparently been approved by both companies ' boards of directors but needs to be approved by McAfee shareholders and government regulators for it to become final . Whispers of a deal meant that McAfees 's stock rose hugely in pre-business trading . It remains to be seen if Intel will offer security software under the McAfee brand for free or if it has plans to continue the paid-for model .

Intel is betting big on its Smart TV technology – calling it the biggest thing for TV since the `` invention of colour '' . While we will have to wait to try out the tech to say we agree with the hyperbole , the demos we have seen do look pretty interesting . But it was n't until Google threw its hat into the connected ring and announce it was doing Google TV – a service that combines TV and the web – that things got really interesting . We have n't seen much of Google TV in action but a video of Mike Payne , director of experience design , Intel digital home group , shows just what may be involved in the service . In a video posted to YouTube ( and found by Android Headlines ) Payne outlines some interesting features of Google TV / Smart TV , including how the service – using the CE4100 Atom processor – will meld internet and broadcast content together . `` There is a series of things [ Smart TV does ] which will reunite people 's experiences with television , '' notes Payne in the video . `` There is a lot more richness and value we can bring by integration of internet content and personal content with that broadcast experience . '' One way Smart TV is doing this is with visually enhancing the plain-old EPG and creating a browsing experience which is image not text based , as Payne explains : `` The notion of visual browsing on televisions gets away from that static television experience and helps users discover new things to watch . `` You can go through the visual scroll wheel instead of leafing through a text-based programme guide . `` The other thing which shows off your content is this notion of a video wall , where you get a much richer access to content from the internet and broadcast . `` You can search this content , so it is about getting what you want without having to worry about where it is coming from . '' New Smart TV devices will be available this year and TechRadar is hoping that it will get its hands-on the service , which will be in everything from Blu-ray players to TVs to set-top boxes . It 's not just how we interact visually with content , with Payne revealing that how we use the humble remote control will change . `` We are also getting away from the online keyboard and using voice search , so you can say NCIS into a remote or television and get that experience , '' say Payne . `` The next generation of remote controls will have touch , gesture and will bring a far better experience than the button-based remotes we are using today . '' Alongside this will be social networking via your TV . Skype has made huge inroads into this , with the VoIP service available on a number of TVs and Payne sees this as something that will become much more dominant in the future . `` The social experience is critical and will be coming to television in a much more new and exciting way , '' reveals Payne . `` Part of what we are focused on is engagement and presence with people from all variety of different places , having a video wall to speak to people and talk about that content and sharing personal content . '' With a release date of Autumn 2010 for Google TV , in the US at least , it wo n't be long before we see if this next generation of TV watching will be anything like the impressive demos we have seen so far . To see the entire video , focus your eyeball below :
Intel 's annual IDF techfest in San Francisco kicks off in a few weeks and that means rumours regarding Sandy Bridge specs are reaching a crescendo . Sandy Bridge is Intel 's next-generation PC processor architecture . That 's right , Intel is tooling up for yet another major update of its CPU tech . Frankly , Intel 's current Nehalem-class processors are more than powerful enough for most people 's needs . More to the point , they 're still much faster than anything Intel 's main rival AMD can manage . But Intel 's relentless `` Tick Tock '' strategy demands either a new architecture or a new production node each year . The end of 2009 saw the first 32nm chips rolling out of the fabs . Thus , the dying days of 2010 will see Sandy Bridge kick in . Sandy Bridge roadmap Intel has n't released full details of the Sandy Bridge product family . But putting the hard info Intel has given us together with some of the more solid rumours , it looks certain the first Sandy Bridge chips out of the gate will be dual and quad-core models . We also know that Sandy Bridge processors will retain Intel 's existing Core i3 , i5 and i7 branding but will dump the existing three-digit model suffix in favour of a new four-digit `` 2000 '' series indicator . Thus the entry level chip will be the dual-core 3.1 GHz Core i3-2100 , with the quad-core 3.1GHz-Core i5 2400 slotting into the midrange and the 3.4GHz Core i7-2600 quad topping things out at launch . Further dual and quad-core chips will fill in the gaps Sandy Bridge performance Six and eight-core chips will also follow later in 2011 . But all this talk of core counts and clockspeeds does n't necessarily tell us much about Sandy Bridge performance . It is an all-new architecture , after all , and that could mean a big boost in core-for-core and clock-for-clock performance . Problem is , Intel snagged all the low hanging fruit in terms of easy performance gains with the Nehalem architecture . You can only bring features like the memory controller on-die once , for instance . Moreover , we know that Sandy Bridge is not a radical new architecture in the mould of AMD 's upcoming Bulldozer [ link : ] . Instead , it 's a major overhaul of Nehalem . Sandy Bridge benchmarks With that in mind , you might not expect any fireworks when the first official benchmark results are published . However , when it comes to floating point performance Sandy Bridge has a trick up its sleeve . Intel has cooked up a new set of instructions known as Advanced Vector Extensions or AVX . Think of AVX as a supercharged version of SSE with data width doubled to 256-bit and you 'll get an idea of the potential processing power . As for all-round CPU performance , reliable numbers are currently hard to come by . However , early engineering samples have begun to leak into the wild . If the handful of benchmarks posted on web forums can be believed , a 2.5GHz quad-core Sandy Bridge processor delivers performance equivalent to a quad-core Nehalem-class chip running north of 3GHz . If true , Intel will have worked some serious magic . Sandy Bridge graphics The final major piece of the Sandy Bridge puzzle is graphics . Both dual and quad-core flavours of Sandy Bridge will be available with a graphics core integrated into the CPU die itself . Early die shots indicate the core is compact , only occupying a small proportion of the overall die . That 's in contrast to AMD 's first CPU-GPU `` fusion '' processor , which purportedly packs a massive graphics core . What 's more , Intel has been up front about the fact that the new core is derived from Intel 's existing integrated graphics technology . We 'll have to wait for the next major architectural shift before the influence of Intel 's stillborn Larrabee graphics project can be detected in its integrated graphics cores . Despite all that , TechRadar 's spies inside the Intel mothership tell us to expect something a little bit special from Sandy Bridge 's graphics performance . Time will tell . Sandy Bridge release date Intel has yet to ink in a firm release date . No doubt we 'll get a better idea of the launch schedule at IDF in September . However , Intel 's rough plan is to begin shipping chips to customers before the end of the year with retail sales beginning either in very late 2010 or early 2011 . Look out for our full Sandy Bridge review then .

The 'master key ' which unlocks the encryption for HD content has been posted on the web and is legitimate , according to Intel . High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection , which is the DRM used to make sure high-definition content is protected and ca n't be copied illegally , has been made public and a number of websites have published the code . While this does n't mean that anyone can start playing HD content on non-licensed devices , it does mean that the potential is there for chipped products to enter the market which can play non-protected material . Speaking to Fox News , Tom Waldrop , a spokesman for Intel said : `` It does appear to be a master key . `` What we have confirmed through testing is that you can derive keys for devices from this published material that do work with the keys produced by our security technology . `` This circumvention does appear to work . '' Chips shopped HDCP is used in most HD products , from Blu-rays to set-top boxes to videogames , so the announcement that the code is now in the hands of hackers is a worrying one for the entertainment industry . However , Intel believes that mass market piracy is n't on the cards , with Waldrop noting : `` For someone to use this information to unlock anything , they would have to implement it in silicon – make a computer chip . `` It would be a lot of work and a lot of expense to do that . '' Even though HDCP has found not to be hacker proof Intel – a partner in the technology – is adamant the encryption tech is still the best around . `` HDCP remains an effective component for protecting digital entertainment , '' he explained . `` It relies on these licensing agreements to ensure that implementations are done appropriately , and there are legal enforcement methods available for cases where it is done inappropriately . '' This story and its headline has been updated ( thanks Si_Smith ) . Via the Register

Justin Ratner , Intel 's Chief Technology officer and freestyle futurologist , whipped out his crystal ball on the final day of the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) and predicted a future of pervasive context aware computing . In his closing keynote , Ratner painted a picture of all-aware computers and devices that know not only where you are , but what you 're doing , feeling and even thinking . Practical demos included a prototype destination application from travel guide outfit Fodors . It was the usual restaurant-toting , point-of-interesting hawking application with the added twist of constantly learning your preferences in terms of factors such as cuisine and price points . The application also had a snazzy auto-blogging feature that combined any photos taken with auto-generated commentary on your whereabouts and activities . It 's all about context Next up was Lama Nachman , Intel 's context-computing specialist . Nachman explained how an array of familiar sensors such as accelerometers , light sensors and GPS could be used to build up a detailed picture of behaviour , location and more . Much of the discussion was theoretical , but tangible examples included a TV remote that detects the user 's identity based on how the device is wielded . From there , the system can present the user with preferred viewing options . Another near-future example involved animated avatars depicting an individual 's status . Think of them as a replacement for those happy headshots in your Facebook feed . Needless to say , neither choosing a restaurant nor allowing friends and family to know you 're out jogging or in a meeting are terribly profound . Where things get really interesting is when you begin to build up a more detailed picture over time . Computerised surveillance Known as context aggregation , the analogy here is personal finance . It 's easy enough to be aware of each individual financial transaction you perform . But keeping track of your broader financial behaviour is much more tricky . Thus , with context aggregation all kinds of short , medium and long term behaviour patterns can be tracked . Forget kidding yourself over how many hours of work you 've done , how much exercise you 've been taken or how much quality time you 've spent with the sprogs . In the future , it will all be logged in cold , hard numbers . Of course , the ultimate end game here is direct reading of your thoughts by computers . Ratner duly delivered with a video showing research into just that by Carnegie Mellon University and supported by Intel . In truth , the video did n't reveal much beyond a system that can distinguish whether a human is thinking of one of two words , but the implications are still , well , mind boggling . As for when we can expect context-aware computing to really take off , Ratner could not sprovide specifics . But as with all things computer-related , the safe bet is sooner than you think .
A leading Intel Fellow explained that SSD `` may never '' become competitive with normal hard drives in terms of price . Speaking at this year 's IDF San Francisco , Intel 's SSD guru , Knut S. Grimsrud , Technology and Manufacturing Group Director of Storage explained that time may be running out for the SSD . He suggests that the timeframe for SSDs becoming cheaper than traditional spinning platter hard drives - on a price per gigabyte level - is `` quite a way off . '' Grimsrud followed that up by saying that it `` may actually never be the case . '' `` That does n't mean it 's hopeless , '' he continued . `` On a per unit basis I do see that in the very near future SSD can actually be cheaper . '' Price per unit more of interest Grimsrud explained that in terms of usage then you could argue that a cheap , `` big enough '' SSD would be cheaper than an unnecessarily large hard drive . `` On a netbook maybe you do n't need a terabyte of storage , maybe all you need is $ 30 worth of storage . '' `` The unit price of a big enough SSD could make it interesting even if the $ /GB is n't competitive . '' He followed that up by talking about when we might actually see large capacity SSDs on the market . `` There really are n't any technical barriers to making really big SSDs today , but there are financial barriers because you pay proportional to the capacity . '' Prices are coming down relatively . `` Costs are scaling really nicely , '' Grimsrud continued . `` You 'll notice with each generation you 're getting more for roughly the same price . ''
Thomas Piazza , Intel Architecture Group Director , Graphics Architecture , spoke honestly about the failings of Intel 's Larrabee graphics architecture at this year 's IDF . At a group panel discussion with the Intel Fellows , essentially some of the smartest people at Intel , Intel 's head graphics honcho was quizzed about Larrabee . When asked if they ever expected to see a Larrabee-based graphics part coming out at all , the entire panel looked directly at Piazza , as he hunkered down in his stool . `` I honestly thought i 'd get through two days without someone asking me that ... '' he said , followed by a simple , `` I do n't think so . '' The Larrabee project was Intel 's great hope of creating a serious consumer graphics card . For years Intel kept hinting at the power and ultra-programmable design of the thing , even going so far as to show a rather weak demo at last year 's IDF in San Francisco . Performance-per-Watt nightmares The project was canned due to numerous delays and poor performance , meaning that even if it finally did appear it would be several generations behind the GPUs of Nvidia and AMD . When asked why Piazza thought it had failed though he was surprisingly candid . `` I just think it 's impractical to try to do all the functions in software in view of all the software complexity , '' he explained . `` And we ran into a performance per watt issue trying to do these things . '' `` Naturally a rasterizer wants to be fixed function . '' Piazza went on . `` There is no reason to have the programming ; it takes so little area for what it does relative to trying to code things like that . '' It turned out that it was a problem of trying to balance out what they were doing , trying to find `` what 's the right level of programmability and what 's the right level of fixed function . '' Unfortunately with the Larrabee project Intel tried to make everything programmable .

Today 's Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) keynote saw Andrew Bond , Vice President of Engineering for Havok announce the physics SDK being made freely available for developers working on Intel 's AppUp store . The second full day of IDF San Francisco has been dedicated to the ongoing development of the Atom platform combined with the netbook-centric AppUp store going gold . Bond announced the company has been working hard to optimise the Havok SDK for the Atom platform and said : 'we are making our physics technology available on the Intel component catalogue and it will be freely available for any developer who wishes to develop games for the AppUp store . ' Bond went on to explain that by making the full physics SDK available to developers they can pick and choose exactly what parts they want to utilise for their games , `` to control exactly what they want out of the simulation technology '' . `` In games it 's about 20 % simulation and 80 % whatever you can get away with ; fakery , he says . 'We focus on the 20 % though ... '' By making the Havok option available to developers working on less graphics-intensive games for the netbook , handheld and tablet markets , Intel is hoping to create a groundswell of physics-enabled titles for its new store . Havok was acquired by Intel almost exactly three years ago , pre-empting Nvidia 's purchase of rival physics-lovers , Ageia and its PhysX technology . Both companies have been working hard to get its own physics simulation out to developers .
Intel has revealed new partnerships with UK high street stalwart Dixons as well as book seller Barnes and Noble and Taiwanese hardware manufacturer Asus as it officially launches the AppUp online application store . Originally unveiled in beta form last year , Intel 's Renee James announced at the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) today that AppUp is now officially good to go . AppUp is Intel 's answer to Apple 's iTunes app store and provides an online portal for purchasing applications for devices running the MeeGo , Moblin and Windows operating systems . Currently , AppUp 's content is mainly aimed at netbook and tablet users . Eventually , Intel hopes it will be bursting with software for smartphones , internet-connected TVs and more . App what ? Wrapping your head around Intel 's intentions with AppUp is n't easy . For starters , Intel is n't getting into the business of selling software itself . Instead , Intel provides the underlying app-store infrastructure which third parties will rebrand and reskin . What 's more , AppUp theoretically includes a wide range of device types from smartphones to HDTVs . So , how exactly does it work ? The basic idea is that device users will log in to any AppUp-based store using a single login or profile . AppUp will recognise their device and only offer compatible software and applications . Moreover , this content will be the same whether it 's the Dixons ' AppUp store or Asus 's . Intel says AppUp has an advantage over the competition thanks to its 24 hour try-and-buy option which allows users to experience the full experience of any app gratis for one day . At this point , you may be wondering what the point is of having multiple stores selling the same content . If you 're Dixons it makes sense in commercial terms thanks to the cut received on every app sale . But for the end user , it makes for a confusing and fragmented looking market place . The great unwashed The reason appears to be Intel 's reluctance to get its hands dirty dealing direct with consumers . It 's simply not something it is comfortable with . Consequently , it 's hard to know what to make of AppUp , whether it will be a success and if so in what segments . During its beta phase , AppUp was dominated by netbook users . However , if Intel does manage to get traction in the smartphone market with the Atom chip and MeeGo companion OS – and that 's a huge , neon-lit , 50-storey if – handsets could dominate the new marketplace . Equally , however , with stiff competition from Apple and Google 's Android , it 's easy to imagine AppUp slowly fading into obscurity . Much like Intel 's efforts to get into the HDTV segment , it 's all to play for . One thing we 're fairly certain of , however , is that if it is a success , it 'll take some iteration and consolidation to achieve . For the record , the Dixons AppUp store will goes live for download November 1st . Dixons ' Gary Hearns told TechRadar that Advent-branded systems with AppUp preinstalled will begin shipping at the beginning of 2011 .
The second day at the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) in San Francisco has been all about Atom , the littlest of PC processors but a very big deal for Intel . Atom is the key to getting Intel into new lucrative markets . The world 's biggest chip company duly rolled out a slew of Atom-related product announcements and industrial alliances aimed at doing just that . However , arguably the biggest coup of all never materialised . There 's still no hard evidence of an Atom-powered smartphone on the horizon . Still , today it was the job of Intel 's Doug Davis to dish details on Atom . Davis unveiled new Atom chips aimed at a wide variety of markets and form factors including tablet PCs , HDTVs and even cars . Put simply , Intel wants its chips powering anything and everything that connects to the internet . Every kind of Atom Our whistle stop tour of the new chips starts with the CE 4200 , a full-on system-on-a-chip design targeted at internet-enabled HDTVs or as Intel would rather they be known , smart TVs . The key upgrade for the CE 4200 over the existing CE 4100 is the addition of a hardware H.264 video encoder . This should allow for various funky new real-time usage scenarios . Think multiple streams , picture-in-picture , piping content between devices and more . The CE 4200 should find its way into various set top boxes and HDTV sets in 2011 . To prove its prowess in the TV market , Intel rolled out long-time bedfellow Microsoft . The Beast of Redmond has been working on a new take on its Media Center tech . The new set top device runs Intel Atom and Windows 7 Embedded to deliver what was described as the full HD Media Centre experience on the cheap . High profile partners Acer and Asus are said to be working on retail versions for 2011 . Intel also announced a new set top device from D-Link and Boxy as well as a new Linux based media centre interface from Amino . Next up is the Atom derivative formerly known as Lincroft . We 've already seen quite a bit of Lincroft branded as the Atom Z600 and part of the smartphone-targeted Moorestown platform . New for this IDF is a derivative known as Oak Trail . The big noise here is the addition on a new daughter chip which provides PCI Express among other functionality . That in turn means support for full house operating systems such as Windows 7 . In short , Oak Trail is meant to be the killer chip for tablet devices and uber thin and light netbook systems . Of the myriad of Oak Trail-powered devices on stage , the show stealer was undoubtedly Dell 's new Inspiron Duo . At first it looks like a chunky 10-inch tablet , only for it to split down the middle and reveal a hidden keyboard and swivelling screen mechanism . Dynamic Duo The Inspiron Duo 's hardware looks pretty hot . Unfortunately , the device was noticeably laggy and unresponsive during the on-stage demo . Still , given that Oak Trail is all about reduced power consumption rather than increased performance , that 's hardly surprising . Atom-powered systems running Windows 7 have always been pretty ghastly . The last of our Atom chips is the new E600 . Designed for embedded applications , the E600 is a chip that will very likely be invisible to end users . However , Intel is hoping it will be powering the infotainment system in your next car . Put all these new Atom chips together and you have a strategy for getting Intel into almost every imaginable internet-connected device , except those pesky smartphones . We 've shot the breeze on numerous occasions with Intel representatives regarding phones . As for the absence of Atom-powered phones at IDF , Intel 's Alistair Kemp rightly points out that smartphone product development cycles are more drawn out and complex than PCs or tablets . The phones , TechRadar is assured , are coming .

Though Sandy Bridge does n't have a DirectX 11-capable GPU on die , there 's one on the way . Intel Fellow and key part of the team integrating the GPU onto the Sandy Bridge die , Tom Piazza , told us today that Intel `` wont be far behind '' in terms of bringing an integrated DX11-capable GPU to market . Sandy Bridge is one of the key focuses of this year 's IDF in San Francisco , as we 've heard in the opening keynote speech , but there 's one thing that Intel 's new 'fusion ' chip ca n't do and that 's run DirectX 11 . In a panel discussion with the Sandy Bridge micro-architecture team , Tom Piazza spoke about the lack of DX11 support in the new chip . `` There are no exclusive DirectX 11 games out yet , '' Piazza says . `` In fact most people skipped over DirectX 10 and most of the games fall all the way back to DirectX 9 . I do n't see the issue right now specifically about DirectX 11 '' So far so damning for the API , indeed he said later on that the tessellation functionality was the only impressive thing about Microsoft 's DX11 . But going forward it 's still going to be an important part of the graphics jigsaw , especially with AMD 's Fusion APUs on the way sporting its own DX11 architecture . Piazza would n't give any specifics , but did go on to say `` DirectX 11 , shall we say , is around the corner on Intel products as well . '' He followed that up by saying that it would n't be `` far behind '' in terms of bringing that functionality to its own integrated graphics .
Intel has confirmed its new Sandy Bridge PC processors will pack a powerful hardware video transcode engine . Dadi Perlmutter , Intel 's all-round computer chip guru , demonstrated the new technology during the opening keynote at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco this morning . For now , Intel is n't talking hard numbers regarding the performance of the new circuitry . However , the on-stage demo showed a Sandy Bridge chip encode a 1080p HD video clip in a matter of seconds . Meanwhile , one of Intel 's existing Core i7 chips , currently the fastest PC processors on the planet , was shown huffing and puffing for minutes over the same task . In other words , the new engine promises to be massively faster than encoding video on any previous PC processor . Dedicated hardware To find out more , TechRadar caught up with Intel 's Josh Newman after the keynote . According to Newman , the transcode engine is part of the newly-integrated GPU core in Sandy Bridge . `` The unit has both dedicated fixed functions for unchanging video codec standards and high bandwidth interaction with the execution array , '' Newman says . In punter-friendly parlance , that means the transcode engine not only has specialised circuitry for decoding and encoding video . It also uses the graphics shaders in Sandy Bridge 's new 3D core . Codec-wise , Newman confirms the engine will support the usual suspects including H.264 , VC1 and MPEG2 . Newman says unleashing the engine 's transcode capabilities will require new software support . Updates to key software including the Windows 7 operating system and popular video management software from the likes of Cyberlink are in the pipeline . GPGPU a goner ? Of course , there 's nothing new about hardware video decode acceleration in PC graphics cores . Even the cheapest and lowliest integrated graphics solutions for PCs already offer 2D decode capabilities . It 's the hardware encode capability that 's new . Indeed , video encode is one of the very last PC applications that really stresses existing CPUs . It also just so happens to be one of the killer applications associated with general-purpose processing on graphics , a discipline sometimes known as GPGPU . Graphics specialist Nvidia in particular has been hyping the potential benefits of running video encode software on its GPUs for several years . Intel is also making bullish claims about the 3D performance of the new graphics engine in Sandy Bridge . Combine that with GPGPU-bashing video encode engine and Nvidia could find itself even further marginalised as a niche player in high end 3D graphics . Meanwhile , even AMD 's upcoming CPU-GPU fusion processor could be made to look a little old hat . Look out for new dual and quad-core PC processors based on the Sandy Bridge architecture when they go on sale early next year .
Intel CEO Paul Otellini 's opening keynote at the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) today confirmed what we already knew . Intel dominates the PC processor segment but desperately needs to break into new markets . Confirmation of Intel 's advantage in CPU tech came in the form of an impressive demonstration of the new Sandy Bridge processor . The new chip was shown tearing through an HD video encode job in seconds while its existing Core i7 required minutes to complete the same task . Due out early next year , Sandy Bridge sports several further exotic new features that promise to increase Intel 's dominance of the PC processor markets . The highlights start with AVX , a new 256-bit vector instruction set . AVX promises to make Sandy Bridge twice as fast as existing PC processors for software such professional rendering . Better graphics Sandy Bridge will also be Intel 's first modern PC processor with a fully integrated graphics core . Intel claims the new core pumps out as many as 32 times more pixels per clock than its existing integrated graphics solutions , making it fast enough to render low-end discrete graphics card redundant . Otellini further underlined Intel 's advantage in chip production by announcing a new 10-core server processor for 2011 and confirming that its first 22nm PC processors are currently navigating their way through Intel 's high tech fabs . Arch-rival AMD has yet to release 32nm processors , much less begin producing 22nm chips . As good as Sandy Bridge will undoubtedly be , however , Intel knows that the market for PCs has effectively plateaued . Factor in tough market conditions thanks to the global financial crisis and the prospects for growth in the traditional PC market are poor . Intel inside ... your phone Instead , the real action in the chip market over the next decade is expected to come from embedded and ultramobile platforms . In others words , HDTVs , cars and , most importantly of all , smartphones . Indeed , Intel says consultancy IDC predicts there will be 31 billion internet connected devices by 2020 . That 's a lot of chips for somebody to sell . Unfortunately , Otellini had little prove it would be Intel selling those chips . No new design wins or alliances in the smartphone or HDTV markets were announced . Instead , Otellini briefly rehashed Intel 's well-worn commitment to produce chips across what it calls a `` continuum '' of devices from desktop and server PCs through ultra mobile and embedded devices . That said , tomorrow is the big day for announcements related to Atom , Intel 's crucial low-power chip for embedded and mobile platforms . Maybe there 's better news to come . Watch this space .

Intel , Samsung and Toshiba have recently teamed up to develop new ways of decreasing the size of chip technologies . The three computing giants are aiming to try to halve semiconductor line widths to 10 nanometers by 2016 , according to the Japanese Nikkei newspaper . Samsung and Toshiba are the world 's top two makers of NAND-type memory , while Intel is the the world 's largest chipmaker . Chip consortium founded The consortium should be extended to around 10 firms all working in semiconductor materials development and manufacture . Intel is currently working on a 32 nanometer NAND ( nm – a millionth of a millimeter ) process , and wants to try to shrink that down to 22nm within two years . Speaking at this year 's IDF , Intel general manager William Holt said chip making was getting increasingly more complicated the smaller the manufacturing process is becoming , hence the need for this latest co-operation in the industry . Japan 's Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry is said to be providing $ 61.21 million of the $ 123 million towards the initial R & D fund . Toshiba and Samsung hope to make 10 nanometer-class NAND flash memory and other chips . Via Reuters

Intel is investing a cool $ 8 billion ( a shade over £5 billion ) in new chip manufacturing plants in the US , with the focus on developing increasingly small 22-nanometer chips . Intel 's latest investment will see upgrades to its factories in Arizona and Oregon , in addition to an entirely new fabrication plant in Oregon . Continued advancement of Moore 's Law Intel hopes to generate around 8,000 construction jobs and between 800 and 1,000 permanent manufacturing jobs at the new and upgraded factories . `` Today 's announcement reflects the next tranche of the continued advancement of Moore 's Law and a further commitment to invest in the future of Intel and America , '' said Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini . `` The most immediate impact of our multi-billion-dollar investment will be the thousands of jobs associated with building a new fab and upgrading four others , and the high-wage , high-tech manufacturing jobs that follow . '' Worldwide manufacturing network Santa Clara-based Intel already has manufacturing facilities at three sites in the US , including New Mexico , in addition to plants in Ireland and Israel . The company is also currently building its first production facility in China . Intel 's focus is on the development of 22 nanometer production ( that 's 22 billionths of a meter ) . `` Intel makes approximately 10 billion transistors per second . Our factories produce the most advanced computer technology in the world and these investments will create capacity for innovation we have n't yet imagined , '' said Brian Krzanich , senior vice president and general manager of Intel 's Manufacturing and Supply Chain . `` Intel and the world of technology lie at the heart of this future . Contrary to conventional wisdom , we can retain a vibrant manufacturing economy here in the United States by focusing on the industries of the future . '' Intel 's microprocessors currently power over 80 per cent of the world 's PCs . Intel recently spent $ 7.68 billion buying up security specialists McAfee Inc. and $ 1.4 billion purchasing Infineon Technologies AG 's wireless-chip unit .

Intel 's forecast for the fourth quarter of 2010 is for better-than-expected sales in the forthcoming holiday season . That sound you just heard ? A collective sigh of relief from across the tech industry . Emerging markets Intel 's Q4 outlook is boosted by increasing demand from emerging markets and corporations , which far outweigh the dip in consumer spending in the west . Shares of Intel and competing chip manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) were up 1 per cent in after-hours trade , following the news . Intel now expects a December quarter gross margin of 67 per cent . Intel 's forecast revenue is between $ 11.0 billion and $ 11.8 billion for the final three months of 2010 , Chief Executive Paul Otellini told analysts that early demand for Sandy Bridge – Intel 's next-gen chip combining CPU and graphics functions - was notably higher than originally anticipated . `` We 'll see the consumer market growing but likely a little less than you 'd normally expect . I attribute that to consumers pulling back a little bit based on economic uncertainty , '' Intel 's Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters . Via Reuters

Back in the days when the average desktop PC was barely capable of running a word processor , let alone sumptuous 3D games , the idea of overclocking your CPU in order to get thousand pound performance from a three hundred pound chip was n't just an indulgence , it was a necessity . A lot has changed . A modern multi-core CPU has a much longer shelf life than its forebears , because performance today is as much a factor of the number of cores and microcode as it is raw clockspeed . An Intel Q6600 bought four years ago is unlikely to feel sluggish for most games , although upgrading is n't expensive these days either . For the not-unreasonable outlay of £150 you can pick up anything from the latest Lynnfield chips through to a six-core monster from AMD . But that 's hardly the point . Dropping £150 is still £150 out of your pocket , and the basics remain the same : Why buy a new or more expensive chip when you can save some serious dough and overclock ? Besides , it 's also a lot of fun . The techniques involved in CPU overclocking have remained largely unchanged since the dark ages of computing too . Take control of the clocks , take care of the extra heating produced , and before you know it you 'll be eyeing up the cost of liquid nitrogen . It 's true that most CPU architectures have a cap beyond which they simply wo n't perform – but the good news is that for current Intel processors , 4GHz or more is easily possible using air-cooling techniques alone . Your CPU 's clock speed is derived by taking the 'base clock ' : a signal supplied by the clock generator on the motherboard , and applying a 'multiplier ' to it . On newer P55 or X58-based motherboards , the base clock is always 133.33MHz by default ; for Core 2 or older CPUs , the base clock varies between 100MHz and 166.6MHz depending on the Front Side Bus . The important thing to remember is that the CPU speed is defined by this external influence ; it does n't just operate from a single internal signal that only it has total control over . Question of multipliers If you are the owner of an 'Extreme Edition ' chip or one of the new K-series models , then you can select what the multiplier will be . That means if you have a Core i7 980X running at 3.33GHz ( 133MHz base clock x25 multiplier ) you can overclock it to 4GHz just by increasing the multiplier to 30 . If you do n't have an unlocked chip ( like the vast majority ) , the multiplier will be a fixed value or , in the case of the Core i7 and i5 CPUs we 've seen , you 'll have a restricted set of options in the BIOS to reduce the multiplier or apply a very small overclock . That means to do any serious acceleration of your CPU you 'll need to increase the base clock itself , and that 's where your choice of motherboard is all-important . Essentially , you 'll need to alter the base clock in the BIOS , something that most motherboards now offer as a matter of course . This same clock is used by the other buses in your machine though , including the PCI-e bus that your graphics card is sat on . This means that those components need to be either well-cooled , so that they can run to keep up as the base clock is accelerated , or you 'll need to be able to 'decouple ' them in the BIOS and leave them running at their stock speeds regardless of the base clock setting . We 're going to be using an MSI P55-GD65 for our walkthrough . It 's a solid board that sneaks in at less than £100 and opens up all the important BIOS settings for us . If you are n't confident fiddling around in the BIOS , it has extra buttons for increasing clockspeeds across the board or automatically finding a modest but stable overclock . Which chip to choose ? To play around with Intel overclocking , any one of Intel 's Core 2 , Core i5 or Core i7 processors are a great place to start . Arguably the best choice right now is the Core i7 920 , a 2.66GHz chip that will crank up to a good 4GHz and has a triple channel memory controller to help the data flowing from the system RAM to keep up with it . There are some drawbacks , though . For a start , you 'll need an expensive X58-based mobo , as well as at least three sticks of RAM . More critically , the 920 has a locked memory multiplier , which means there 's an extra level of fiddling with memory base speeds to keep your system stable . Instead , we 're using a Core i7 870 to show you how to get the most from an Intel-based system . The chip itself is quite pricey , but the accompanying socket-1156 mobos are reasonable and you can decouple the memory timings while finding the fastest stable speed for your processor . The successor to the 870 , the Core i7 870K , is the same chip but cheaper and with an unlocked CPU multiplier , which means it 's even easier to overclock . To achieve stability you 'll need to balance the base clock , the multiplier and the amount of voltage supplied to the CPU and the QPI system interface . Every chip is different , and you may find a high base clock with a low multiplier works better than a low base clock and a high multiplier , or vice versa .

Intel has confirmed it is to launch its latest generation of chips , the Sandy Bridge processor , at CES 2011 . According to Electronista , invites have been sent out which confirm that Sandy Bridge will be shown off at the consumer electronics show in January 2011 . The chip , which is a showcase for Intel 's new CPU architecture , is set to be ( at the high end ) a six-core model , which is made from 32nm silicon and has 15MB of cache memory . The chip is a major overhaul of Nehalem and while it uses Intel 's existing integrated graphics technology , it is said to be pretty special when it comes to graphics performance . Sand storm It will also come with support for Intel 's new 256-bit AVX extensions , a quad-channel memory controller and PCI Express 3.0 . It has been confirmed that there will be an eight-core version available in due course . At the lower end of the spectrum , there will be Sandy Bridge dual- and quad-core variations available . Intel will be hoping that the few months it has got before AMD showcases its Bulldozer chips will give it a bit of an edge . Via Electronista

AMD has stunned mobile world , announcing it will be working alongside rivals Intel on MeeGo – the Linux open source project that 's headed up by Nokia . MeeGo was initiated by Nokia and Intel and is mesh of Intel 's Moblin ( mobile Linux ) operating system and Nokia 's Maemo software platform . It seems while Intel will be bringing CPUs to the MeeGo party , AMD is looking to offer up its upcoming APUs - so-called Accelerated Processing Units that combine the traditional functions of CPUs and graphics processing in the same chip . Expanded opportunities In a statement , Ben Bar-Haim , corporate vice president of software development at AMD , said : `` MeeGo represents an exciting , open-source mobile operating system we expect to be adopted by mobile and embedded device makers over time . `` We are glad to provide engineering resources to joint industry efforts like MeeGo and expect that this operating system will help drive our embedded plans and create expanded market opportunities for our forthcoming Accelerated Processing Units . '' In a way the move makes a lot of sense for AMD . AMD is a gold level member of The Linux Foundation , so it seems fit that it makes a contribution to the MeeGo Project . Considering Intel has a big part to play in MeeGo , though , it is great to see two rivals working together in the name of open source . Via Recombu

Intel is soon set to launch a new-and-improved chip platform specifically for the booming tablet PC market . The launch of Intel 's own inexpensive and low-power chip platform – codenamed Oak Trail – is set for early 2011 . Improved tablet PC efficiency The Oak Trail chips boast improved energy efficiency and compare and compete well with similar low-power chips already on the market from Intel 's competitors , such as the UK-based ARM who currently dominate the smartphone chip market . Intel marketing director Anil Nanduri said of Oak Trail : `` The biggest power part of the tablet is the panel . In terms of an idle-use case we are competitive in a tablet usage compared to any other solution out there . '' Oak Trail will let users watch HD video on a tablet for up to eight hours at a stretch , claims the Intel man – which , if anywhere near the truth , suggests that new tablet PCs arriving later in 2011 will be even more ideal for long-haul flights and long trips . Apple currently owns a whopping 95 per cent of the fledgling tablet PC market , with sales predicted to soar in 2011 and a number of new Android-OS devices set to arrive on the shelves over the coming months . Samsung recently launched its Galaxy Tab in the UK , following Dell 's launch of its Streak tablet earlier this year . Tablet shipments are predicted to grow by around 200 per cent next year , while more traditional laptops and desktop PCs will expand just 13 per cent , according to the latest report from iSuppli .

Intel has confirmed that it plans to move from 300mm to a 450 mm wafer size in 2013 . The change is planned to happen at the company DX1 22nm plant , which is going to be built in Oregon , and made to handle both wafer sizes initially . The 450mm wafer size promises to be more cost efficient by reducing manufacturing costs and letting Intel produce greater quantities of chips that have lower yields ( the amount of working chips produced ) . Going to a larger wafer size allows the company to satisfy the increased demand even with the lower yield that will be almost inevitable as it moves more to 22nm production . Wafer thin mint ? There can be problems involved with increasing the number of silicon chips on a wafer , and the new 450 mm wafer could face these . Both increasing the wafer size and shrinking the process size could give some headaches . Intel is trusting that the lower manufacturing costs will more than compensate for this . To date Intel has n't said whether other plants might be upgraded to support the bigger wafers in advance of its flagship DX1 plant . All that 's certain is that it 's coming soon .

Intel is pinning its hopes on the tablet PC and smartphone markets in 2011 , hoping to sell more of its chips to phone and slate computer manufacturers next year . Intel hopes to follow the success of Apple and Google in the mobile and tablet PC markets . Laptops , tablets , smartphones `` The consumer ( tablet ) products will roll out over the first half of next year , '' Chief Executive Paul Otellini told analysts this week . Otellini outlined that tablet manufacturers including Dell , Asus , Lenovo and Toshiba have agreed to use Intel chips in 35 tablet models in 2011 . Intel has been incredibly successful in the netbook market with its Atom chips , yet has so far failed to make considerable business in the fast-growing tablet PC or mobile phone markets . `` Intel is moving in the right strategic direction but they still have a long way to go , '' said Hendi Susanto , an analyst at Gabelli & Company . `` They 're late into the game . There is no clear visibility on what the products look like . '' Medfield chips on the way Intel 's share of the world semiconductor market fell to 13.8 per cent in 2010 from 14.2 per cent in 2010 2009 . Otellini said that Intel 's move into the smartphone market was `` a marathon , not a sprint , '' and that Intel 's Medfield chip should ship next year and in 2012 . `` You will see smartphones from premier branded vendors in the second half of 2011 with Intel silicon inside them , '' said Otellini . Intel has started shipping its Sandy Bridge chips , which should be in new notebooks early in 2011 . Via Reuters

Intel , the world 's largest chip maker , has stopped and recalled all shipments of the 'Cougar Point ' chipset , affecting all laptops and desktops which use its new Sandy Bridge processor . Intel explained that the problem was with its Series 6 chipsets that are used in all new Sandy Bridge-based laptop and desktop PCs . Costly chip problem It seems that the recall is down to the a problem with the SATA ports within the chipset , which `` may degrade over time , potentially impacting the performance or functionality of SATA-linked devices such as hard disk drives and DVD-drives '' . Following the announcement of the problem , Intel has cut its first-revenue forecast by $ 300 million ( £187 million ) this week , with the total costs of repairing and replacing the faulty chip estimated to be around $ 700 million ( £437 million ) . `` It was the result of a series of stress tests conducted on the chipset . It did n't show up under normal testing , '' explained Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy . `` The problem would n't happen immediately but after two to four years . '' The problem really could not have come at a worse time for Intel , with the company facing increasing competition from the booming and fast-growing demand for smartphones and tablet PCs , with Cambridge-based ARM currently leading the way in those markets . Intel plans to deliver a fix for the problematic Cougar Point chip in late February . For the time being , Intel assures those users with new Sandy Bridge PCs that they can `` continue to use their systems with confidence , while working with their computer manufacturer for a permanent solution '' .

Black Eyed Peas superstar Will.i.am has landed a fancy-sounding job as Director of Creative Innovation at computing giant Intel . The unique role will see him `` collaborate with Intel on many creative and technology endeavors across the `` compute continuum '' that may include such devices as laptops , smart phones and tablets , '' says Intel . The frontman adds that : `` Nearly everything I do involves processors and computers , and when I see an Intel chip I think of all the creative minds involved that help to amplify my own creativity . `` Teaming up with the scientists , researchers and computer programmers at Intel to collaborate and co-develop new ways to communicate , create , inform and entertain is going to be amazing . '' Amid the hyperbole this sounds like it could be similar to a deal Lady Gaga has with Polaroid where both parties get kudos for their association with each other 's name and not an awful lot else . Will.i.apps The paint-by-numbers pop artist already has his fingers planted in many tech pies . This morning he outed a Black Eyed Peas 360 degree music video app from his new mobile company Will.i.apps . Back in 2008 , he signed on with Nokia to tell us all how wonderful the new Comes With Music service was going to be . We all remember how that went . Let 's hope that for his sake , and Intel 's , that this marriage has a happier ending . The Twitter verdict is already in . James McIntyre tweets : `` Nice to see Will.i.amjoin the Intel board . The bad news : he 's replacing the Intel `` five-note jingle '' with a 9-minute ripoff of an 80s song . ''

Intel believes it still has a `` huge opportunity '' in the smartphone market . That 's according to the head of Intel 's Software and Solutions Group Renee James . TechRadar grabbed a few minutes with James and colleagues Doug Fisher and Peter Biddle to talk about Intel 's plans for the smartphone market , MeeGo and AppUp , Intel 's application store . Believe it or not , Intel 's Software and Services Group ( SSG ) would be among the top five software companies globally if it were a separate entity to Intel – and that 's before adding in the proposed acquisition of McAfee which James is personally responsible for . But surely Intel realises it may have missed the boat in the smartphone market ? `` No I do n't , obviously , '' says the senior vice president of Intel SSG . `` I actually think we have a huge opportunity ahead of us as the smartphone market is growing and there are hundreds of millions of users untapped .

The BBC has announced that Erik Huggers is to leave his Director of Future Media & Technology post to become Corporate Vice President and General Manager of Intel 's Digital Home Group . Huggers will be a massive loss to the BBC , as he was the man who was in charge of pivotal digital operations for the broadcaster , including the iPlayer after he took over from Ashley Highfield , and was a massive component in restructuring the online arm of the BBC . In a memo to BBC staff , which was procured by PaidContent , BBC director general Mark Thompson said about Huggers : `` Erik is the key architect for a radical refocusing of BBC Online as part of our proposals for Delivering Quality First , which we will be announcing in due course . `` He also presided over significant technology projects such as W1 , BBC North and Fabric and has chaired the YouView consortia to the point where it was incorporated as a joint venture . `` He has been a dynamic and inspiring colleague and I wish him all the best with his new role at Intel . '' Split the difference Thompson has already decided on Hugger 's successor , revealing that the job has been split . Chief Technology Officer ( CTO ) , John Linwood will head up a new Technology division which will be responsible for delivering the BBC 's digital needs in terms of production , broadcast , connectivity and enterprise support . Ralph Rivera has been appointed as director of future media , a division which will focus on developing and delivering digital products and services . Both of these appointments will take place in March . Huggers is no stranger to the computing side of the tech world . Before joining the BBC in 2008 he was at Microsoft , in charge of running the European arm of Windows Media . Via PaidContent

Intel CEP Paul Otellini has insisted that he is not worried about Microsoft 's announcement that the next version of Windows will run on ARM chips . Currently Windows runs on x86 chipsets – based on an early Intel CPU – but new designs are beginning to proliferate on other devices , and UK company ARM in particular is having an impact . Microsoft 's announcement at CES 2011 that it would not be limiting its next Windows release to x86 systems , but that it would also run on ARM chips is set to shake up the world of chips . And clearly that is not something that Intel can ignore as it looks to the future . Speaking at the company 's financial results , Otellini insisted that Microsoft 's forthcoming changes to Windows will actually help the company in the touch-enabled ( tablet , PC and mobile phone ) arena . And he expressed his doubt that ARM can make an impact on the business PC area that makes the money for Intel . `` The plus for Intel is that as they unify their operating systems we now have the ability for the first time , one , to have a designed-from-scratch , touch-enabled operating system for tablets that runs on Intel that we do n't have today ; and , secondly , we have the ability to put our lowest-power Intel processors , running Windows 8 or the next generation of Windows , into phones , because it 's the same OS stack . And I look at that as an upside opportunity for us , '' said Otellini . `` On the downside , there 's the potential , given that Office runs on these products , for some creep-up coming into the PC space . `` I am skeptical of that for two reasons : one , that space has a different set of power and performance requirements where Intel is exceptionally good ; and secondly , users of those machines expect legacy support for software and peripherals that has to all be enabled from scratch for those devices . '' Intel is certainly in rude health in the mean-time , with the company announcing record fourth quarter results ( including a $ 3.39 billion profit – around £2.1 billion ) and making confident prediction for the first quarter of 2011 .

Sapphire 's decision to offer up enthusiasts mainboards means that it is bringing overclocking features to the Sapphire Pure Black , including the Diamond Black , choked with coolers that feature on the company 's well-appreciated top-end graphics cards . `` Designed to appeal to the enthusiast , the first product will be a fully featured X58 board , to be known as the SAPPHIRE Pure Black X58 , supporting the Intel core i7 series of processors , '' states Sapphire . Highly-regarded `` In addition to the established and highly-regarded X58 chipset , the board incorporates many state of the art features such as on-board USB3.0 , SATA III ports in addition to SATA II , Six dual channel DDR3 memory slots and 3 Gen2 ( x16/x8/x8 ) and one Gen1 ( x4 ) PCI-Express expansion slots as well as a host of peripheral connections and on-board 8-channel audio , '' the company adds . The SapphirePure Black P67 Hydra is broadly similar to its brother , but has been designed to offer a little more flexibility in terms of graphics options . `` To be known as the SAPPHIRE Pure Black P67 Hydra , the new board shares many of the features of the X58 model , but in addition to the Intel P67 chipset it uses the Lucid Hydra chip to allow a mix of graphics configurations to be used in its PCI-Express slots , '' explains Sapphire 's release . Both boards are apparently in production , but pricing and a UK release date have not been confirmed .
Intel is set to pay Nvidia $ 1.5 billion ( £0.96 billion ) to license its graphics technology , settling a legal dispute between the two companies . The deal settles a legal dispute between the components giants , giving Intel the right to use Nvidia 's graphics tech in its PC chips . The agreement is a six-year cross-licensing deal , extending each company 's access to the other 's tech . Memory However , the deal excludes proprietary Intel x86 designs , and other areas like flash memory . `` The cross-licensing agreement allows Intel to integrate NVIDIA technologies and those that are covered by our patents into their CPUs , such as Sandy Bridge , for example , '' said Nvidia boss Jen-Hsuan . `` And a cross-license allows us to build processors and take advantage of Intel patents for the types of processor we 're building—Project Denver , Tegra , and the types of processors we 're going to build in the future . '' Nvidia 's shares immediately shot up in value following the announcement of the deal – a clear recognition of the value of its tech to Intel . For its part , Nvidia will also get to use some of Intel 's tech , as it develops its own PC CPUs in partnership with UK chip-maker ARM , who 's chips are to be found in most smartphones . Nvidia is developing an ARM-based PC central processor under the code name `` Project Denver '' - which will provide direct competition to Intel in the PC market . Via Ars Technica

Intel is serious about making inroads in the tablet and smartphone markets . That 's according to Mooly Eden , Head of the PC Client Group at Intel , who TechRadar met with after the chip manufacturer 's presentation at CES 2011 today . `` We 're serious about this category . We 're designing great low power in microprocessors . You 'll see it start to ramp . It will be much more meaningful in 2012 , we 've got a whole team working on some great solutions . Another category we 're dead serious about is smartphones . '' During the earlier keynote , Intel CEO Paul Otellini said the corporation would present smartphone announcements at next month 's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona . So far Intel has struggled to make inroads in these two markets as it competes with the low power , low heat ARM-based processors found in almost all mobile phones and tablet devices such as the iPad - but it will be interesting to hear what it has to say next month . Short-term fuss Eden certainly believes tablets are a category to be reckoned with . `` Tablets are here to stay , '' he added , who said he sees tablet devices as `` a mainly complementary device rather than replacing the notebook . '' He said that people simply could not give up their notebooks for serious work , citing the example of a journalist who was taking notes on an iPad , but who still had a notebook in his bag . Eden also believes the tablet fuss is a short-term thing . `` I believe in the future the big hype will be over and it will just be another category complementing [ the PC ] . '' `` At the moment , it 's the new kid on the block . ''
Intel has announced its new , long-awaited Sandy Bridge processor architecture at CES 2011 . And as usual , we 're first out of the blocks with a batch of reviews of compatible motherboards , a full system and , of course the processors themselves . Click the links in this article to get to the reviews . Our first taste of the new chips comes in the form of two desktop CPUs - check out our Intel Core i5-2500K review and Intel Core i7-2600K review - ignore the familiar branding , these are all-new units . At launch , it 's not quite a full range of processors . Intel is rolling out 14 new desktop CPUs based on Sandy Bridge under the Core i3 , Core i5 and Core i7 brands . Pricing extends from around £75 to £250 . The very top and bottom of Intel 's desktop range will remain unchanged . The six-core Gulftown derivative of the Core i7 and the entry-level Pentium chips live on for now - though we 're really not sure why . Everything else is effectively supplanted by Sandy Bridge . Motherboards Our Asus Maximus IV Extreme RoG review shows this is the quickest Sandy Bridge board we 've tested , but then we have n't seen many yet . Still , it 's worth noting that we achieved our highest air-cooled overclock of Sandy Bridge , an impressive 4.6GHz , with this board . The MSI P67A-GD65 review shows it represents something very different from the Asus Maximus IV Extreme that 's also just been released . It is n't necessarily aimed at the high-end enthusiast segment . It 's a board for people wishing to build up their new platform with a reasonable feature-set and at a reasonable price . Finally , if you 're going to make the migration to a new Sandy Bridge system , why not consider a small-form-factor board , such as that examined in our Foxconn H67S review ? Full PC Our Scan 3SX Vengeance review tests the first full PC we 've seen to actually put the new second-generation Intel Core platform into context . Sandy Bridge platform is good , but until you actually see it in a machine , it 's tough to quantify .

If you 've read our review of Intel 's new desktop Sandy Bridge processors , you 'll know they 're bonkers quick . But you 'll also be aware that Intel 's latest processor architecture is arguably more about mobile . On paper , the Sandy Bridge architecture looks purpose built to drop into laptop PCs . It 's Intel 's first chip with processor cores and high performance graphics on the same slice of silicon – it 's almost a system on a chip . Sandy Bridge is also based on Intel 's latest 32nm production node and packs promising new features such as the Quick Sync Video encoder and AVX instruction extensions . Put it all together and you have a recipe for what could be immense mobile performance combined with better than ever power consumption . Hard numbers Happily , we can bring you some hard numbers regarding the first half of that equation . Intel let us loose in its labs with an early Sandy Bridge mobile evaluation platform . It 's representative in terms of performance , but we 'll have to wait just a week or two longer for a retail system our first glimpse of just how good Sandy Bridge 's battery life will be . Our sample Sandy Bridge notebook is running the Core i7-2820QM . That 's a quad-core chip with an advertised frequency of 2.3GHz . As we 'll see , that latter number does n't mean much due to the aggressive implementation of Turbo Boost in the latest Sandy Bridge processors . For comparison we have both a dual-core Core i5-540M and a quad-core Core i7-740QM from Intel 's existing mobile CPU line up . Out of the gate , the new quad-core Sandy Bridge chip blows away the previous generation processors in the Cinebench R10 software rendering test . The new 2820QM clocks a time of just 47 seconds to the one minute and 27 seconds of the quad-core 740QM and one minute 42 seconds for the 540M dualie . It 's a similar story in the x264 HD video encode test , the new Sandy Bridger hitting 28.4 frames per second to the 740QM 's 16.4fps and 12.7fps for the 540M . If you 're wondering where the performance boost is coming from , much of it is thanks to Turbo Boost 20 . With all four cores active , and even running inside a thermally suboptimal development chassis , the new 2820QM runs at between 2.8GHz and 3.0GHz . Of course , Sandy Bridge has that funky Quick Sync Video transcode engine so the gap with supporting encode software will be even bigger . Get a load of the graphics Arguably just as interesting is the performance of the new Intel HD Graphics video core . All the new Sandy Bridge mobile chips get the full 12-processor HD Graphics 3000 version . The direct comparison here is with the 540M , since the 740QM lacks integrated graphics . Anyhow , the shizzle here is 27fps for the new Sandy Bridge graphics compared to 15fps for the 540M in Call of Duty 4 at high detail and 1280 x 800 resolution . Actually , the number for the Sandy Bridge is a little lower than we expected . But we anticipate slightly better performance from final retail laptops . If that 's a sneak peak at the performance of the new Sandy Bridge processors , the elephant still standing is battery life . On paper , the new Core i7-2820QM does n't look like a big step forward by this metric . After all , it has the same 45W TDP as existing quad-core mobile Intel processors . In fact , none of the new mobile Sandy quads is rated below 45W . However , Intel 's TDPs are only rough guides . What 's more , the new graphics core of the Sandy Bridge chips must fit inside that TDP . Existing Intel mobile quads contain only CPU cores . All of which means we 're hopefully for some serious progress . With any luck quad-core might just be the new dual-core .
Did Intel forget to enable its intriguing Quick Sync Video transcoder engine , as found in its new Sandy Bridge processors , on the P67 platform ? You can read our full review of the launch chips , including the awesome Intel Core i7 2600k . For those who have n't , the elevator pitch for Intel 's new processor architecture goes something like this . It comes in dual and quad-core trim . It has extremely impressive 2D and 3D video capabilities . And it 's bonkers quick . It is not , however , perfect . Initially , we thought all the problems were due to dumb marketing decisions . We 're still pretty sure , for instance , the restriction of the fastest HD 3000 graphics engine to the two unlocked K Series models , the Core i5 2500K and the i7 2600K , is purely marketing driven . Likewise , we think it 's unlikely Intel really needs another new CPU socket – especially one that drops just a single pin – and we suspect the overclock-killing internal clock generator was marketing motivated rather than architecturally essential . As for Intel 's increasingly batty branding , the less said the better - quite literally . The last time we tried to explain what the whole Core i3 , i5 and i7 shebang meant , it nearly reduced us to tears . Intentional omission or embarrassing oversight ? However , there 's one Sandy Bridge anomaly that increasingly looks like an oversight at best and a major cock up at worst . It involves Quick Sync Video , the 2D video transcoding engine that 's found in all Sandy Bridge processors , regardless of specification or core count . More accurately , the Quick Sync Video engine is actually part of the new integrated Intel HD Graphics core . The problem , of course , is that the P67 chipset is discrete . In other words , it does n't support the integrated graphics core . Exactly why you would want to completely rule out any possibility of using the integrated graphics is n't clear . Intel argues the P67 is a performance chipset and that 's fair enough . But there 's no harm in having the integrated core as a back up option . Anyway , the current upshot of all this is that Quick Sync Video requires the HD Graphics core to be enabled . But you ca n't enable the HD Graphics core on any P67 board . So , you ca n't have Quick Sync Video on the highest performing Sandy Bridge platform . That 's a serious downer for two reasons . Firstly because Quick Sync Video looks like it might well be killer for video encoding . Our initial testing suggests it 's nearly four times quicker than CPU encoding . And bear in mind , that 's CPU encoding on the 2600K , which is a ludicrously fast processor . Quick Sync Video is probably ten times faster , perhaps even more , than a chip like an old Core 2 Duo . The problem with P67 The other problem is that the P67 is currently the only chipset that fully supports Intel 's new overclocking regime . You can read more about that in our Sandy Bridge review , but the bottom line is that performance enthusiasts will want the P67 chipset . But they 'll also want to use Quick Sync Video . And since they 've paid for the frigging HD Graphics core , why should n't they be able to use that ? It 's all thoroughly unsatisfactory . Making this whole story even more intriguing is the rumoured arrival of a third consumer-orientated Sandy Bridge chipset known as Z68 . If the scuttlebutt is correct , the Z68 is the one chipset to rule them all . It supports both the HD Graphics core and the overclocking options . In other words , it 's what the P67 should have been . Quite why the Z68 is not available at launch we can not say with certainty . But it sure looks like Intel suddenly – and belatedly - realised the P67 has a major problem .
The soon-to-be-revealed Sandy Bridge chip from Intel will offer customers a little something extra : new-release movies that will be streamed to computers using the super-chip . Warner Bros is among the Hollywood studios planning to offer high-definition films via Sandy Bridge , with Intel working to strike deals with other content distributors . Films will be available at the same time as they are released on DVD and the chip comes with built-in DRM to prevent pirating of the streamed content . Jack of all trades ? By wooing Hollywood with its protected premium content option , Intel hopes to differentiate itself further from competitors and make chip choice more important to the PC consumer and movie studios alike . Intel 's Sandy Bridge CPU promises improved multimedia processing and , because the central processing and graphics processing are done on the same piece of silicon , it is said to be faster and more efficient than previous iterations . The long-rumoured CPU was recently shipped to manufacturers and is set to be officially revealed at CES this week . Via Reuters

Nokia has made a mistake by hooking up with Microsoft 's Windows Phone 7 platform according to Intel CEO Paul Otellini . Nokia backed-out of a recent deal with Intel to make devices based around the MeeGo platform in order tyo concentrate on making devices for Microsoft 's latest mobile OS . Now Otellini has accused the fading Finnish mobile giant of selling-out to Steve Balmer and co and reckons , if anything , the company should have listened to Google 's pleas to join the Android platform . `` Incredible offers '' He says Nokia boss Stephen Elop received `` Incredible offers - money '' from both Google and Microsoft in order to make devices for those operating systems . He added : `` I would n't have made the decision he made , I would probably have gone to Android if I were him . MeeGo would have been the best strategy but he concluded he could n't afford it . '' Otellini reckons that Nokia will now struggle to differentiate itself from other manufacturers on the closed WIndows Phone 7 platform . He says : `` It would have been less hard on Android , on MeeGo he could have done it . `` Some closed models will certainly survive , because you can optimise the experience , but in general , if you harness the ability of all the engineers in the world and the developers in the world , open wins . '' New partners In the wake of the MeeGo platform 's status as a complete non-starter , a sore Otellini says Intel will find new partners in order to press ahead in the mobile sphere . He added : `` We will find another partner . The carriers still want a third ecosystem and the carriers want an open ecosystem , and that 's the thing that drives our motivation '' So despite the WP7 tie-in seeming like a perfect fit for the embattled mobile giant , Nokia ca n't seem to catch a break . Shareholders are dissatisfied with the deal and rumours continue to persist that Microsoft is preparing an eventual takeover . Tough times . Source : Reuters

Intel has continued to paw at the mobile phone market with a preview of Medfield , it 's 32nm mobile processor . But , as with Intel 's previous mobile announcements , there was no serious partnership to talk of – only the promise that it was `` sampling to customers . '' Anand Chandrasekher , senior vice president , Intel Ultra Mobility Group , showed a prototype Android phone packing the processor , but it was a tease . However , it could be the Aava Mobile handset that has previously been rumoured . Chandrasekher talked up the chipset 's abilities on active , rather than idle power . `` On active power , we are [ as in x86 ] the most efficient architecture on the planet . That 's what we do , work to make active power work better . '' `` It will have the longest use time , '' he promised of the new chip . `` We 'll have the same standby as everybody else claims . `` You 're not buying a phone so you can leave it on idle . You 're buying a phone so you can use it , browse the web and so forth . What about MeeGo ? Renée James , senior vice president and general manager of Intel'sSoftware and Services Group also talked about support for different platforms on mobile . `` All operating environments run on Intel silicon . And nothing has changed . '' And what of MeeGo after the Microsoft announcement ? `` We 're open source [ advocates ] . It is n't surprising that we would continue on with MeeGo on its own . '' We 're working with developers from the iPhone environment , from the Android environment to MeeGo . Anything we have running on x86 can [ work across platforms ] . We support Android… As Chrome [ OS ] comes available from Google we 'll be supporting that . ''

Barely a month after the world proclaimed the latest series of processors and motherboard chipsets from Intel were the best things since sliced silicon we 've got a recall on our hands . Intel Sandy Bridge is all a bit of a mess is n't it ? Intel recently discovered that a support chip on the Sandy Bridge 6-series motherboards , codenamed Cougar Point , was causing degradation issues with the affected board 's SATA ports . It 's a question of b0rked silicon , so there 's no softly , softly , software update solution available . It 's all a question of replacing the broken chip at a manufacturing level . It 's not all the 6-series motherboards that are affected , though : only a small percentage have the issue according to Intel and other motherboard manufacturers . So if you 're sitting on some brand new Sandy Bridge silicon and your heart leapt into your mouth when you heard about the issue , it should n't be a huge worry for you . Your CPU 's fine , for the most part your motherboard 's fine , and it 's not going to be killing your hard drives either . It 's also only affecting the SATA 3Gbps ports on the problem boards , too , so as long as you plug into the 6Gbps sockets you 'll be fine . And if yours is one of the affected boards you 'll get it replaced at Intel 's cost as it 's already gone into production of the replacement silicon . But it 's surely a massive worry for Intel . That 's despite the fact the $ 700 million Intel has estimated it will take to repair and replace the 'affected materials ' is barely a drop in the ocean compared to its huge revenue . Given that the variance in its projected first quarter revenue is plus or minus $ 400 million , that recall hit starts to look relatively minor . When you 're looking at revenue of $ 11.7 BILLION in the first quarter of this year alone that 's almost pocket lint… What it will affect , though , is consumer confidence . AMD to capitalise ? And that 's something that could play into the AMD-shaped competition 's hands when it releases its brand new CPU architecture , Bulldozer , this Spring . AMD has stuck by its sockets , and only with the imminent release of Bulldozer are we going to see a new chip socket , the AM3+ . And even that is going to be backwards compatible . If Bulldozer can compete on any level with Intel 's architecture then there is now going to be a real processor bun fight as the days get longer . Intel has already taken a bit of a hit in the press over the lack of access to the integrated graphics goodness of the QuickSync Video transcode engine with the P67 chipset . And we 've been hammering its marketing department for the longest time about the obfuscation of its product lineup . I still struggle to understand why we can now have three Core i7 motherboard chipsets and three Core i7 processors and they 'll all be mutually incompatible . But we always forgave Intel because it had the best silicon available . The Intel Sandy Bridge problem is going to put doubt in the consumer 's mind at least . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Liked this ?

Intel is now selling the 510 Series SSD – with the latest solid state drive coming in 120GB and 250GB versions . The latest drives bring the SATA 6Gbps interface – which delivers read speeds of an impressive 500MB and write speeds of 315Mbps . The benefits of SSDs are becoming increasingly well publicised , with the drives providing much faster read and write times than traditional HDDs . Faster There is , of course , still la huge difference in price per GB of storage , with SSDs still primarily used as boot drives and either the cloud or HDDs used for mass storage . The drives are already on sale – with a UK price of £224.54 for the 120Gb version and £426.30 for the 250GB version . Intel has also produced a few videos showing just how much difference there is between a 10,000 RPM HDD and a SSD .

This article is brought to you in association with LG Optimus 2X It 's almost 40 years since Intel released its first CPU , the 4004 , a ground-breaking processor that crammed all the computing power of ENIAC - the first general purpose computer - into a tiny silicon chip . Of course , what was impressive in 1971 looks , well , rather less spectacular today . And now the Intel 4004 is most useful as an example of just how far CPU technology has come in recent years . Take the clock rate , for instance : the 4004 ran at only 108KHz . In a mere eight years , the Intel 8088 ( the power behind the first IBM PC ) would run at 5MHz , something like a 50x speed boost . And a modern 3GHz CPU has a clock rate around 30,000 faster than the humble 4004 . And the increase in the transistor count , probably a more accurate indicator of CPU power , has been even more spectacular . The Intel 4004 contained a mere 2,300 ; the 8088 increased this to more than 29,000 ; and if we jump to a modern high-end Intel Xeon chip , then the transistor count is now more than 2 billion : a million times more than that first CPU . WHERE IT BEGAN : Intel 's first CPU , the 4004 The CPU world has generated plenty of other amazing statistics over the past few years , but of course this is n't just about the figures : what 's more important are the technologies that they 've made available . Intelligent cameras with face recognition ; spreadsheets with analytical powers that even governments could n't achieve just a few years ago ; cars that are beginning to be able to drive themselves ; incredibly cheap and versatile tablets , and smartphones with more power than a 1970 's mainframe are all becoming commonplace . That 's all great , but it does leave us with a couple of questions . Can the CPU industry really maintain this level of performance increase ? And if so , what new technologies might it deliver in the next few years ? Moore 's Law In 1965 , Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would double , every two years , an observation so accurate and important that it became known as `` Moore 's Law '' . And it 's this rapidly increasing complexity and power that has driven the amazing gains in CPU performance that we 've seen in recent years . ON THE MONEY : In 1965 Gordon Moore predicted exponential growth in CPU power that would lead to `` home computers '' , `` automatic controls for automobiles '' and `` personal , portable communications equipment '' Can this continue ? Antonio Gonzalez , director of Intel Labs Barcelona is confident , at least for the near term : `` The trend in CPU performance has been spectacular in all the key parameters : every year more power , more speed , transistors are smaller , energy consumption is down . There are always new challenges to be faced , but I 'm sure the trend will continue . We are in good shape to keep evolving the technology for at least a decade , and perhaps much more . '' It is n't going to be easy , however . Transistor sizes are already tiny , as Gonzalez explains : `` Currently we 're working to a 32nm process [ structures that are 32 billionths of a metre in size ] , and this will be down to 22nm very soon . That 's less than the size of the influenza virus , and 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of the human hair . '' It 's also approaching the size of an atom ( around 0.1nm ) , though , and that 's going to present us with a fundamental barrier before too long . And Nandan Nayampally , director of product marketing at ARM , sees another problem . `` Starting from around 40nm , the problem is n't really the transistors , it 's the wire delay [ the time it takes to send signals around the chip ] . We are beginning to hit that limit , and it 's a major issue for speed . '' New approaches will be required to maintain the growth in CPU performance , then , and fortunately the industry is already working on a number of promising projects . IBM has been researching 3D chip stacking , for instance , which sees CPU cores no longer placed next to each other , but stacked vertically . The cores can be linked by connections covering their entire surface , greatly improving transfer speeds , and they 're more easily cooled so heat is less of an issue . BUILDING UP : Stacking CPU cores on top of each other is a promising idea that could deliver significant speed increases And Intel reports that it is investigating `` the user of compound semiconductors ( rather than silicon ) ... [ which ] show promise of greatly improving transistor performance while reducing power '' ( while many other researchers are looking at possible replacements for silicon ) . Moore 's law will be running into some rather fundamental roadblocks in the 2020s , then , but there are plenty of new technologies on the horizon , and these may enable it to continue for some time yet .

Intel has introduced the next-generation of its Atom processor technology , previously codenamed Oak Trail . The tech is designed to power tablets rather than netbooks , and we previously saw it in action inside several prototype designs at CES in January . The new 45nm Intel Atom processor Z670 is at the heart of the platform , which also includes the Intel SM35 Express Chipset . The transition to a two chip architecture is designed to improve performance and power management . Aside from the usual performance advantages , the new platform is designed to give manufacturers economy of scale , with support for Windows 7 and Android as well as Intel 's OS partnership with Nokia , MeeGo . It 's also designed to get back at ARM 's huge advantage in the tablet market . `` We see huge opportunity here , '' explained Kevin O'Donovan , strategic marketing manager for Intel in Europe . `` We see tablets and netbooks being complementary devices to your primary computing device . It 's a cumulative growth for the IT industry . `` This year we have about 35 designs in the pipeline , you 'll see more and more designs coming into the market . `` As we go from 45nm to 32 to 22nm in the 2013 timeframe we will have a competitive advantage in these markets . '' Intel has previously tried to get into the smartphone market with Atom , but as yet has no launches to speak of . Will it have more success in tablets ? When asked about this O'Donovan was hardly coy , saying that `` 2011 is about Intel becoming relevant [ in tablets ] . '' `` Three or four years ago if you 'd have said to people tablets were as big as they are , you 'd have been laughed at – tablets had been out for years . Then Apple did what they did . '' New Atom for netbooks also in 2011 The Oak Trail platform is designed to enable thin form factors of all types but is a fork in Intel 's Atom roadmap ; current-generation netbooks run the Pine Trail platform , which will transition to Cedar Trail by the end of 2011 . Oak Trail runs parallel to these plans . Intel says that there will be as many as 65 new tablet designs this year from various vendors and that it remains committed to Atom . Given ARM 's domination of the phone and tablet market , Intel finds itself playing catchup in a way that it has n't had to since the processor wars were dominated by AMD on gaming performance . However , Intel believes it can also have a slice of the operating system market . `` We do believe that Apple , Google , Microsoft and MeeGo will be the ecosystems of the future , '' said . The next generation of Atom to be launched is already sampling . It 's called Cedar Trail and as O'Donovan explains , it 's aimed at more innovative , ultra thin netbooks based on 32nm technology as we head into 32nm . `` As we head into 2013 with 22nm you 'll see a lot more SoC ( System on Chip ) features with more wireless technology and security features , '' he added .

Intel has revealed its latest laptop-based chip plans over at Computex , putting the emphasis on low power and skinny looks in order to claw back some share from the tablet market . The term Intel has coined for this 'new ' category is 'Ultrabook ' , which we 've already reported to the hyperbole police and expect the chip maker to be hauled into the exaggeration station along with Steve 'Magical ' Jobs and HTC any minute now . Although no official Ultrabook products have been unveiled , Intel 's executive vice president , Sean Maloney , reckons they `` will make up 40 per cent of the market by the end of 2012 . '' A bridge too far It 's all thanks to the 22nm Ivy Bridge chipset , which will be a diminuitive 0.8-inches thick and provide faster responses and 'tablet-like features ' . If it wants to hit 40 per cent of the consumer market , Intel better keep the pricing of the Ivy Bridge chips manageable , pointing to a sub $ 1,000 price point to be getting on with . Intel has been getting all cosy with Asus to show off the first ultrabook , imaginatively dubbed the UX21 Asus Ultrabook , which runs the latest 2nd gen Intel Core processor aka Sandy Bridge , and looks a lot like a MacBook Air to us . The first of these ultrabooks will ready and raring to go for the 2011 Christmas shopping season , while the Ivy Bridge chips should make their way to computers in the early part of 2012 .

Intel 's comments about multiple versions of Windows 8 have landed the company in Microsoft 's bad books , as Microsoft 's Mark Martin has spoken out to refute the claims . Renee James , senior vice president at Intel , yesterday commented that there would be both ARM and Intel versions of Windows 8 , and that the ARM editions would not run legacy applications . Martin , however , has offered a sharp rebuttal : `` Intel 's statements during yesterday 's Intel Investor Meeting about Microsoft 's plans for the next version of Windows were factually inaccurate and unfortunately misleading . '' Bullish He continues , `` From the first demonstrations of Windows on SoC , we have been clear about our goals and have emphasized that we are at the technology demonstration stage . As such , we have no further details or information at this time . '' As much as Microsoft has called Intel 's comments 'factually inaccurate ' , the company sounds unlikely to clarify which parts were not true – and we 're not likely to find out for a while . The earliest we 're likely to find out more concrete detail on Windows OS is September and we 've got a whole summer to go before then . Via Business Insider

Intel has let slip a few Windows 8 tidbits , including the fact that there will be editions that run on ARM processors as well as versions that require Intel 's own chips . Speaking at Intel 's Investor Meeting 2011 , Renée James , head of Intel 's software business , explained that the Windows 8 ARM editions will be tailored to mobile devices and Windows 8 tablets . `` Windows 8 traditional '' will be the desktop version which runs on Intel 's x86 architecture and will include a Windows 7 mode , according to James . Confusable She clarified , `` [ Windows 8 traditional ] means that our customers , or anyone who has an Intel-based or an x86-based product , will be able to run either Windows 7 mode or Windows 8 mode . They 'll run all of their old applications , all of their old files – there 'll be no issue . `` On ARM , there 'll be the new experience , which is very specifically around the mobile experience , specifically around tablet and some limited clamshell , with no legacy OS . `` Our competitors will not be running legacy applications . Not now . Not ever . `` We 'll kind of have the best of both worlds . So we think we 're extraordinarily well-positioned in Windows 8 . '' Via Channel Register

Intel has blamed its ill-fated partnership with Nokia as the reason for delays in bringing its long-promised processors for smartphones . CEO Paul Otellini called the MeeGo tie-in a mistake , and that the company would have been better-off choosing a different partner . `` In hindsight , Nokia was the wrong partner to have picked , '' said the Intel boss . Medfield chips The CEO 's comments came as he promised investors that smartphones bearing the new Medfield chips will be available early next year . `` You 'll see the first Intel-based phones in the first part of next year , '' Otellini added , before going onto say that `` phones shipping in the market from major players '' from the get-go . Intel had first told the world that handsets would offer the 32nm , smaller , more powerful and more efficient chips by 2011 but the MeeGo melee has delayed things somewhat . With the dual-core revolution now taking hold , Intel will have plenty of competition when the handsets finally come to market in 2012 .

Intel has announced a major innovation in microprocessors this week : the world 's first 3D transistors , called Tri-Gate , which will be used in the corporation 's next generation of desktop , laptop and mobile chips . It means that - for the first time since the invention of silicon transistors over 50 years ago - transistors using a three-dimensional structure will be manufactured in volume , used inside Intel chips later this year . What is Tri-Gate ? First invented by Intel research scientists in 2002 , Tri-Gate is a new way of manufacturing transistors that the corporation will introduce with its move to 22nm logic technology late in 2011 . And , what 's more , they bring a whole new dimension to proceedings ; the three-dimensional Tri-Gate transistors represent a fundamental departure from the two-dimensional planar transistor structure that has powered all consumer electronics devices to date . NOW : The 2D transistors we 've been using for half a century . This shows 32nm transistors with the source , drain and channel ( the latter covered by the gate ) all in the same plane The Tri-Gate transistor is so named as the gate has three sides . The traditional 'flat ' two-dimensional planar gate is replaced with an incredibly thin three-dimensional silicon fin that rises up vertically from the silicon substrate . THE FUTURE : This image shows the vertical fins of Intel 's revolutionary tri-gate transistors passing through the gates Control of current is accomplished by implementing a gate on each of the three sides of the fin – two on each side and one across the top - rather than just one on top , as is the case with the 2D planar transistor . And since these fins are vertical , transistors can be packed closer together . Why is Tri-Gate needed ? Without the new transistors , it would have been difficult for Intel to continue to uphold Moore 's Law . This is the 1965 theory by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors in a given area would double every two years , with increased functionality and reduced cost . Intel says its scientists have long recognised the benefits of a 3D structure for sustaining the pace of Moore 's Law as device dimensions become so small that physical laws become barriers to advancement – as process technology has got smaller , problems such as current leakage have needed to be dealt with . `` For years we have seen limits to how small transistors can get , '' said Moore of Intel 's latest innovation . `` This change in the basic structure is a truly revolutionary approach , and one that should allow Moore 's Law , and the historic pace of innovation , to continue . '' What are the benefits ? Intel says there 's a `` dramatic performance gain at low operating voltage '' – thanks to far reduced current leakage . Indeed this translates to a 37 per cent performance increase at low voltage versus Intel 's 32nm planar transistors and under a 50 per cent power reduction with constant performance . Basically , the new transistors consume less than half the power when at the same performance as 2D planar transistors on 32nm chips . Better control over the transistor gate enables as much transistor current flowing as possible when the transistor is in the 'on ' state for performance , and as close to zero as possible when it is in the 'off ' state to reduce power . The new transistors will also have better ability to be turned on and off to save power when they 're not needed . ILLUSTRATION : On the left side is the 32nm planar transistor in which the current ( represented by the yellow dots ) flows in a plane underneath the gate . On the right is the 22nm 3D Tri-Gate transistor with current flowing on three sides of a vertical fin When will Tri-Gate transistors be announced ? We 'll start to see 22nm processors appear later in the year – and the process will supecede the current Sandy Bridge processors in due course . This keeps on track Intel 's plan to introduce a completely new processor generation every two years . Intel has already demonstrated a 22nm chip codenamed Ivy Bridge – the corporation has also said they will continue to use the Intel Core branding for desktop and laptop chips as well as Atom for handhelds and other mobile devices . Tri-Gate replaces the High-k Metal Gate transistors announced alongside the move to 45nm in 2007 . Each 22nm processor will have somewhere in the region of 2.9 billion transistors on board . More than 6 million 22nm Tri-Gate transistors could fit into the space taken up by the full stop at the end of this sentence . What devices will 22nm be used in ? As well as servers , desktops and laptops , Intel says 22nm is poised to take a hold in the mobile device market . `` The low-voltage and low-power benefits far exceed what we typically see from one process generation to the next , '' says Intel Senior Fellow Mark Bohr . `` It will give product designers the flexibility to make current devices smarter and wholly new ones possible . We believe this breakthrough will extend Intel 's lead even further over the rest of the semiconductor industry . '' Will the new 22nm processors cost more ? In its documentation Intel says the new manufacturing process costs around 2-3 per cent more , but we would n't expect this to mean anything by the time it gets inside your next PC , Mac or tablet . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

Intel has announced that it is bringing 3D transistors to its new 22nm microchips , insisting the new tech will advance Moore ' Law into new realms . Moore 's Law states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double ever two years , and the move from 2D to 3D will apparently keep this on course . The 1965 `` law '' is named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore and has , so far , been upheld by Intel in the face of the increased challenge of smaller manufacturing processes and the resulting power leakage . Intel has demonstrated a 22nm microprocessor – codenamed Ivy Bridge – that will be the first high-volume chip to use the three-dimensional Tri-Gate transistors - a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter . Long gestation Tri-Gate is n't a wholly new announcement - it was first mooted as a technology by Intel in 2002 . But it remains that three-dimensional transistors represent a fundamental departure from the two-dimensional planar transistor structure that has powered all computers , mobile phones , car tech and consumer electronics to date . But Intel is clearly stoked about the news . `` Intel 's scientists and engineers have once again reinvented the transistor , this time utilizing the third dimension , '' said Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini . `` Amazing , world-shaping devices will be created from this capability as we advance Moore 's Law into new realms . '' Intel has handily offered up a video explaining what 3D transistors actually provide , with Intel Senior Fellow Mark Bohr - you can also read on for more on the performance gains offered up by the new process . The new Tri-Gate transistors enable chips to operate at lower voltage with lower leakage , broadly meaning improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art transistors . The capabilities give chip designers the flexibility to choose transistors targeted for low power or high performance , depending on what they 're needed for - Intel is talking about a 37 percent performance increase at low voltage versus Intel 's 32nm planar transistors . Great for mobile tech That means the 22nm processors will be ideal for use in small handheld devices , which operate using less energy to `` switch '' back and forth . Alternatively , the new transistors consume less than half the power when at the same performance as 2D planar transistors on 32nm chips . `` The performance gains and power savings of Intel 's unique 3-D Tri-Gate transistors are like nothing we 've seen before , '' continues Mark Bohr . `` This milestone is going further than simply keeping up with Moore 's Law . The low-voltage and low-power benefits far exceed what we typically see from one process generation to the next . `` It will give product designers the flexibility to make current devices smarter and wholly new ones possible . We believe this breakthrough will extend Intel 's lead even further over the rest of the semiconductor industry . ''

Today we used a Windows 7 tablet that delivered an equivalent user experience to an iPad 2 while doing so much more . And it was an 18-month old single-core Atom tablet , too . Yes , really . We would n't have believed it with our own eyes if we had n't sat there swiping , zooming and firing multiple video streams across six different screens and devices with our own fingers . And all incredibly smoothly . What Francois Piednoel , Senior Performance Analyst at Intel , and his extensive team have managed in the last nine months is quite staggering . It has created what it calls a recipe for an improved end user experience and Piednoel has been travelling Taiwan the last three weeks talking with the tablet manufacturers and giving away this secret . There 's no altruistic reason why Intel wants the rest of the competition to succeed - once the software limitations are out of the equation then the tablet battleground then becomes all about hardware performance once more . And Intel knows that in terms of straight performance chops its processors have got the edge . The recipe What Apple knows , and what Intel has only just realised fully , is that the end-user experience is king . We 've all been benchmarking the latest tablets and the performance figures rarely ever show the iPad 2 as the winner . All the perception model testing that Intel carried out in the last nine months though , showed that Apple 's products just felt better to the end user . And much of that , it seems obvious , is down to the responsiveness and the smoothness of the device when you use it . `` If you run the benchmarks on an iPad 2 it does n't get the best score ... there 's a disconnect between the two , '' said Bin Fu , one of Intel 's Benchmark Managers . The marriage of software and hardware that Apple has created with its devices means that it has total control over how they work as a whole . `` Apple had a recipe , now Intel has our own recipe to do that , '' says Piednoel . `` The biggest strength of Apple - they got this wisdom from a platform everybody knows as the Amiga 500 . All of those tricks come from this era , small hardware , difficult to program , but it was around for years . '' The bottleneck for all tablets , whether they 're MeeGo , Android , Windows or IOS , is the memory bandwidth and Piednoel explained the problem in simple mathematical terms . Intel found the key to a good user experience over a mediocre one was to have a screen that scrolled at 60fps . That is one of the main things separating the iPad from its rivals . The science In order to do that though takes an incredible amount of resources meaning the operating system needs some serious optimisation routines to cope . The 18-month old tablet we were presented with had a resolution of 1300x800 with a 32-bit screen running at 4bytes per pixel . That equates to needing 256MB/s to redraw the screen at 60fps . When you factor in Windows 7 transparency layers then you triple the required bandwidth . Eventually you end up with an operating system that writes 7 times for each pixel under Win7 , the effective pixel-depth . Under Android that drops to around 6 and with iOS around 4 . Pixel-depth is how many times you are going to draw the pixel on the screen for a certain resolution . With Intel 's demonstration software layer running happily on top of a standard Windows 7 installation , it drops to 4 times like the iPad . Still that requires a full 1GB/s of memory bandwidth and when the total platform bandwidth of tablet platforms is between 1.6GB/s and 2.4GB/s that 's no small number . And that 's just to get the screen scrolling at 60fps . That then leaves the app programmer only 600MB/s on an Atom platform with which to work . If he uses any more than that and you start dropping frames and the end user experience deteriorates . `` To make something like an iPad then you need to be a reasonable person , '' explains Piednoel . Meaning that you need to stop the programmers making calls on the hardware at the expense of the user expeerience . Responsiveness Another issue with the Windows touchscreen experience has been the complete lack of responsiveness . The iPad has a reaction time of around 15 milliseconds , so you barely notice the lag between moving your finger and the screen moving . In Windows tablets programmers have been unable to get the response time below 200ms . Essentially it 's all down to the fact Windows is a mouse-centric OS . The reason the 200ms time has become a barrier is because that 's the amount of time the OS waits before executing a single click order . Why ? Because it needs to wait around to see if there 's going to be a second click ... This is what Intel calls a eureka moment . Now by fooling the Windows OS into thinking the tablet overlay is a video game it suddenly gains access to the Direct Input libraries and response time is carved up . As Matt Dunford , World-wide Benchmarking Manager states , `` there were some things in the OS that were limiting Atom from achieving its potential . '' With this simple software-level fix in place even as ancient , and seemingly pathetic a tablet as the single-core Atom device we had in front of us is , it can do things the iPad simply has n't the horsepower to do . There 's now no waiting around for Microsoft to get its next , touch-friendly version of Windows out the door . Within 12 months the playing field could be levelled by a simple software download . And you know what ? That Windows 8 demo we saw earlier in the week is suddenly looking even more tasty . Check out our video below :
It 's Computex week , when the great and good of the tech industry heads to Taipei to show off their stuff . And if there 's one trend this year , it 's been battling over tablets . First up was ARM , whose processor designs power many of the tablets on sale today . The firm has big plans : it wants to take its 10 % share of the mobile market to 50 % by 2015 . Intel was n't going to take that lying down . It 's invented a new kind of computer , which it calls a Slightly Thinner Laptop . Sorry , we mean Ultrabook , As Kate Solomon reports , `` Although no official Ultrabook products have been unveiled , Intel 's executive vice president , Sean Maloney , reckons they 'will make up 40 per cent of the market by the end of 2012 ' . '' It 's all thanks to the Ivy Bridge chipset , which is thinner , faster and more energy efficient . We should see the first Ultrabooks in time for Christmas , with Ivy Bridge turning up in computers in early 2012 . Intel also has a new version of the Atom , the Oak Trail , which has been specifically engineered for tablets , delivering the performance for demanding apps while taking up less space and consuming less power . Roll on Kal-El So things look to be breaking down into Intel and ARM bellowing `` We will be the mobile king ! '' at one another . And , of course , Nvidia is part of it . We knew about its ARM-based quad-core Tegra 3 , codenamed Kal-El , already , but Nvidia 's Computex demos have been knocking people 's socks off . Expect to see Tegra 3s in tablets later this year . Not to be outdone , AMD 's been showing off its mobile tech too . AMD general manager Rick Bergman showed off a brand new Trinity APU , which is its term for a chip that combines CPU and GPU on the same silicon . Dual- and quad-core versions should turn up on tablets in early 2012 . Did someone mention tablets ? Computex has more tablets than a branch of Boots The Chemist . Among the more interesting models were Acer 's Iconia M500 running MeeGo , which currently looks like the world 's loneliest tablet operating system since co-parent Intel washed its hands of the whole thing . There 's also the world 's first seven-inch Honeycomb tablet , the Viewsonic ViewPad 7X . Last , but not least , there 's the Padfone , Asus 's bizarre and yet strangely attractive attempt to bring tablets and smartphones together . Like the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz , the Padfone does n't have a brain : that 's provided by the smartphone that lives in a secret compartment inside it . We are not making this up . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Liked this ?

Intel has announced another quarter of record profit , with CEO Paul Otellini pointing to the growth of mobile devices as a key factor in the chip giant 's growth . Intel surpassed $ 13.1 billion ( £8.1bn ) in revenue for the second quarter of 2011 , with servers , strong demand for high-end Core chips and the continued growth of mobile devices all cited . `` We achieved a significant new milestone in the second quarter , surpassing $ 13.0 billion in revenue for the first time , '' said Paul Otellini , Intel president and CEO . Advanced tech `` Strong corporate demand for our most advanced technology , the surge of mobile devices and Internet traffic fueling data centre growth , and the rapid rise of computing in emerging markets drove record results . `` Intel 's 23 percent revenue growth in the first half and our increasing confidence in the second half of 2011 position us to grow annual revenue in the mid-20 percent range . '' Interestingly , Intel stated that newly acquired McAfee and Inineon Wireless Solutions ( not Intel Mobile Communications ) contributed $ 1 billion in their first full-quarter of results . Breaking the results down further , Intel 's PC client group had revenue up 11 per cent year on year , its Data Server group reported a 15 percent increase and Embedded & Communications Group saw a 25 per cent increase . One sour note was the waning impact of the mobile Atom processor and chipsets , which saw revenues drop by 15 per cent .

There 's a lot to smile about when it comes to Intel 's latest chipset ; Z68 puts right the silly mistakes and arbitrary differences between P67 and H67 platforms , and one of the biggest improvements is overclocking . If you 've got a Z68 motherboard , you can increase your core multiplier , DDR3 memory ratios , boost your power and current limits - as you can on the P67 platform . Where the Z68 differs from the P67 chipset , though , is in the processor graphics core of the Sandy Bridge chips . You can overclock that too , at the same time as CPU core multipliers . That means you can get faster frame rates if you 're playing games with on-die graphics , and reap the general benefits of a quicker CPU , all at once . So why should you overclock your system if you have a Z68 motherboard ? Well , simply because you can . Because previous Sandy Bridge chipsets did n't allow this freedom , and because Sandy Bridge CPUs themselves have tons of overclocking potential . But first… A word of warning though . Tweaking your CPU and graphics at the same time is nothing new , but when a discrete card 's providing the grunt , power and current are increased over separate areas of your computer , and the same goes for temperature . When the graphics are on die though , all the extra performance you dial in comes from one rather delicate two centimetre slice of silicon . As a result , it 's harder to keep temperatures in the safe zone . Moreover , the benefits of tweaking the iGPU and CPU at the same time are dubious . We noticed that at times performances actually dropped when we boosted them both , likely due to all that heat and throttling . It 's a balancing act boosting them to the right amount . Get it right though and you can boost the iGPU to produce frame rates that really make the difference between unplayable , playable , and infuriating . Our test rig for this project is an Intel Core i7 2600K in an Asus P8Z68 V Pro , cooled by CoolIt 's ECO ALC water cooler . We 've seen very impressive numbers posted by that CPU , as high as 5.2 GHz on enthusiast mobos like the MSI Big Bang Marshal . With some diligent tweaking we squeezed a very stable 5.0 GHz out of it . Bearing in mind we used a relatively cheap cooler and motherboard , that ai n't half bad . Every CPU and motherboard has its own overclocking threshold though , and results can vary significantly between seemingly identical chips , particularly the amount of voltage they can hack . So this guide is n't about achieving a certain GHz , it 's about getting the most from your particular system . Right , now lets get elbow-deep into all the funky BIOS options your Z68 motherboard has to offer and see what we can get out of this chip . 1 . Let The BIOS do the work The simplest overclocking method is to run an auto-overclock procedure like Asus ' OC tuner . With one click you 'll get a useful slice of extra performance auto adjusting CPU ratio , voltage and BCLK frequency . Your rig might restart a few times before it finds the best settings . The downside to this technique is that it does n't absolutely push the boundaries the way you could by tweaking manually… 2 . Know your settings …and if you 're going to get your hands dirty , the key settings to examine are CPU ratio and CPU Vcore . Ratio 's going to ramp up your core clock frequencies and Vcore is the main source of power for your CPU . Most of your time is going to be spent tweaking these two settings . It 's useful at this point to turn off SpeedStep and set Load Line Calibration to auto . This will avoid throttling at higher temps . 3 . Learn your multiplication tables CPU ratio ( aka multiplier ) will accept any number between 34 and 56 , which would hypothetically give a stonking 5.6GHz . Tiny increments are the key : ramp up the multiplier in twos . If your system boots , load up a CPU-heavy benchmark like Cinebench 11.5 and run it a few times . If it passes the stress test , head back to the BIOS and increase the ratio by another 1 to 2 . 4 . Trial and error Eventually you 'll hit a wall and crash . Here 's where Vcore comes in . You want to run with as little voltage as possible , so when you 've maxed the ratio , increase the Vcore a little to give your CPU more juice . The sweet spot is around 1.44V to 1.55V , but again , increase slowly and stress test if it boots . Ignore CPU PLL and PCH-increasing these voltages wo n't give you any more overclocking room . 5 . Push the limits If you over-volt , you 'll get a POST screen error message . Go back to your last good setting , then try increasing the ratio some more . When you max both ratio and Vcore , you can still squeeze a drop more from BCLK/PCI-e , so try adding 1 to the current value . Depending on your RAM speeds , you may need to actually clock it down to find an appropriate speed for your memory . 6 . One-stop graphics boost To boost processor graphics performance , iGPU max frequency is your man . As mentioned the benefits of clocking CPU and iGPU at the same time are questionable , but increasing the iGPU frequency by just 100MHz will give you higher frame rates . Stress test with a gaming benchmark then reboot and increase by another 50MHz or so . Voila . You 've made full use of the overclocking features of Z68 gratis .

Intel has released more details on its next-generation high-performance and enterprise server Itanium chips , codenamed Poulson . A blog post by Intel 's data center group general manager Pauline Nist sheds light on the new processors , which were revealed during the Hot Chips conference at Stanford University . The cores on the chip have been doubled to eight over its predecessor , codenamed Tukwila . A 32nm manufacturing process has been employed over Tukwila 's 65nm process . In addition , the transistor count has been upped from a meagre 2.046 billion in Tukwila to 3.1 billion in Poulson . Three key area features were announced . Intel Instruction Reply technology uses a new pipeline architecture to capture errors in execution and correct them immediately . This is far faster than the current architecture , which completely refreshes the pipeline in the event of an error . Improved hyper-threading technology enables independent front and backend pipeline execution to improve multi-thread efficiency . Finally , new integer operations , expanded software prefetch and thread control mean that the Itanium architecture can `` grow with future needs '' , according to Nist . Although it 's unlikely that the new technology will make its way into the hands of consumers , Nist notes that features `` often waterfall down to subsequent generations of Xeon CPU chips '' , which power non-consumer servers and workstations . via Intel

Intel 's Cedar Trail , the updated version of its wildly-popular netbook-powering Atom chip , has been pushed back from a September release to November . The delay in the coniferously-monickered chip is said to be down to the graphics driver and Windows 7 certification issues , both of which are fairly crucial in the world of shiny Windows 7-powered netbooks . Performance and power consumption of Cedar Trail chips are set to be exactly where the latest Atoms are now , but with the added bonus of an integrated GPU on the chip . This will enable fanless designs , Blu-Ray 2.0 support , full 1080p media playback and digital display outputs such as HDMI and DisplayPort . There will also be full DirectX 10.1 support , although we ca n't imagine that you 'll be able to play Crysis 2 on the devices . In addition , Intel 's proprietary technologies such as Wireless Music , Wireless Display , PCsync and Fast Boot will be compatible with the chip . Although netbooks are quickly being usurped by tablets , we at TechRadar still have a certain fondness for them and their proper keyboards . Cedar Trail could be the performance boosting component needed to turn netbooks into more fully-fledged computers - if people are still buying them , that is . via Engadget

Intel 's much-vaunted skinny-but-powerful Ultrabook laptop PCs have received a boost with the company 's announcement of a $ 300 million fund ( £185m ) for the development of software and hardware . The Ultrabooks - which are said to deliver `` a highly responsive and secure experience in a thin , light and elegant design '' - are natural competitors to Apple 's Macbook Air and other ultra-slim PCs . Intel 's Capital Ultrabook Fund is set to invest in companies that specialise in hardware and software that will give the laptop longer battery life , as well as improve physical designs and storage . The cash will be invested over the next three to four years , with the overall aim being to create a `` cycle of innovation and system capabilities '' . Intel 's Ultrabook strategy comprises of three stages , which begins with its second-generation Core processors later this year , then moves on to its Ivy Bridge processors in 2012 , and concludes with Haswell chips in 2013 . The Haswell chips are estimated to have half the power consumption of current chips . In addition , Intel has announced that the first Ultrabooks will be launched later this year at the under- $ 999 ( £617 ) sweetspot . Lenovo , Asustek and Acer will be the first manufacturers to produce Ultrabooks . Despite powering the ubiquitous netbook and powerful desktop PCs , Intel has been out of the mobile innovation game for some time . Hopefully the Ultrabook will put the company back on track in this market . `` The PC is the ultimate Darwinian device and Intel is striving to again reinvent mobile computing , '' said Mooly Eden , vice president and general manager of Intel 's PC Client Group . via Reuters

Intel has made a $ 30 million investment in two new cloud computing research centres at Carnegie Mellon University in the US . The chip giant has invested in a five-year program to fund the new Intel Science and Technology academic research labs , which will focus on cloud computing and embedded computing research . More specifically , the research at Intel 's new centres will look to provide open source innovations to better analyse data and provide users with useful real-time information on their surroundings . Justin Rattner , Intel Chief Technology Officer is clearly something of a dreamer and a passionate believer in the power of technology to help make our lives better , saying , `` For example , future cars equipped with embedded sensors and microprocessors to constantly collect and analyze traffic and weather data . That information could be shared and analyzed in the cloud so that drivers could be provided with suggestions for quicker and safer routes . '' Intel 's press release adds that the research will also look at areas such as `` built-in application optimisation , more efficient and effective support of big data analytics on massive amounts of online data , and making the cloud more distributed and localized by extending cloud capabilities to the network edge and even to client devices . `` In the future , these capabilities could enable a digital personal handler via a device wired into your glasses that sees what you see , to constantly pull data from the cloud and whisper information to you during the day - telling you who people are , where to buy an item you just saw , or how to adjust your plans when something new comes up . '' That sound ? That was the rumble of Philip K Dick turning in his grave . Via ComputerWorld
Intel is aiming to take on the MacBook Air in the superthin laptop category , with a new , surprisingly affordable range of Ultrabooks . Intel claimed at Computex back in May that it thinks Ultrabooks `` will make up 40 per cent of the market by the end of 2012 . '' And that 's no idle boast , if the latest news on the pricing plans for Ultrabooks are anything to go by , with strong suggestions that Intel is set to hit that all-important sub- $ 1,000 sweet spot price point . The latest news on Ultrabook manufacturing costs comes from Digitimes , which claims that Intel 's Ultrabook 's standard bills of materials will be in the range of $ 500- $ 700 , which is noticeably less than the cost of manufacture of an Apple MacBook Air . Digitimes also notes that Intel is considering using fiberglass instead of opting for a unibody magnesium-aluminum chassis , in an `` aggressive '' move to cut price even further . Intel plans to release two ranges of super-slim 18mm notebooks ( with 11-inch and13-inch screens ) and 21mm-thick notebooks ( with 14-inch and17-inch screen ) and , just like the MacBook Air , NO optical drive . Intel 's new Ivy Bridge-based notebooks should arrive in stores at some point early next year . We 'll bring you more official news as and when it comes in . Via TechCrunch and Apple Insider

Justin Rattner , Intel Chief Technical Office , today showed off a prototype CPU with such a low power rating that it can run from a solar cell the size of a postage stamp . Code-named Claremont the Pentium-class processor is capable of operating at less than 10mW and still run operating systems such as Linux or Windows . `` It 's part of our long standing obsession with power reduction , '' said Intel CEO , Paul Otellini when he showed a sneak peak of the setup on Tuesday . The huge power saving has been made possible by operating the transistors in the processor at near their threshold voltage . The threshold voltage is the voltage at which the transistor turns on . Today 's processors operate at several times the threshold voltage in order to up the performance at the expense of power usage . If you run the transistors at closer to the threshold voltage you can make huge gains in efficiency . The Claremont prototype manages a 5x increase in energy efficiency by making this change . As a genuine , old Pentium core the gains are impressive , but this is purely a tech demo at the moment and processors designed from the ground up to run this way would be far more efficient . Still , one of the benefits of operating that close to the threshold voltage is that it gives a wide , dynamic range to the operating frequency . That means while it can run lower than 10mW in an OS you can also ramp up the power to improve performance when needed . Rattner demonstrated a second setup running the prototype Claremont CPU at 10x the speed of the first demo . That machine was then capable of playing Quake . All while still being powered by that same tiny solar cell . Currently it 's only the CPU itself that 's being solar-powered , with the rest of the system still being powered by a traditional PSU . Eventually though there will be a platform to partner such low-voltage CPUs , though at the moment there are no plans to productise solar-powered PCs .
Intel CEO , Paul Otellini , remains bullish about the prospect of Microsoft supporting the ARM architecture in the upcoming release of Windows 8 . Down the coast in Anaheim Microsoft is hosting the Build Conference as Intel runs its IDF2011 conference here in San Francisco . There it was talking up its support for the ARM micro-architecture in the next version of the Windows OS . Otellini though is unconcerned with the prospect of added competition in the Windows space . `` We 've always had to have the best chip to run on Microsoft software , '' he said . `` When you have the best chip you win . '' It 's not just the architecture that 's important though as there 's a vast library of legacy applications out there supporting the x86 platform . `` In PCs the value of legacy in compatibility of the 6million applications to the billions of users is pretty substantial , '' said Otellini . `` I do n't think users will easily walk away from that . '' Intel has long had competition in the x86 space with AMD in Windows and now outside that traditional x86 market comes ARM . Nvidia could be one of the greatest beneficiaries of this change in the Microsoft OS with its ARM-based Project Denver chip looking to enter the mainstream desktop CPU space . But Otellini thinks Intel could well benefit too . `` I 'm perfectly comfortable that this is actually an opportunity for us to go back to places like tablets . I think Microsoft could help energise the tablet market . '' Stephen L. Smith , VP and Director of PC operations at Intel , thinks actually it should be the rest of the processor ecosystem that should be worried about Intel . `` You see these billboards down the road that start talking about how many GHz your phone has , '' said Smith . `` That performance race and performance expectation that people had in PCs over the last 20 years is now showing up in smartphone and tablet devices . '' `` We believe we know how to play that game . We believe that we have the design and silicon process advantage that allows us to lead there . ''
Intel reckons its next consumer SSD , code-named Cherryville , will be the fastest SSD on the market when it launches this Autumn . It briefly disclosed a few details of Cherryville at today 's round of technical sessions at this year 's Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) , hidden amongst a sea of enterprise-level announcements . The Cherryville SSD will be based on 25nm multi-level cell ( MLC ) NAND memory and , according to Troy Winslow , Marketing Manager of Intel 's NAND Solutions Group , will be `` the highest performing SSD in the marketplace . '' That 's quite a claim with the likes of OCZ 's Vertex 3 , ADATA 's S511 and Patriot 's Wildfire SSDs already pretty much maxing out the bandwidth of the SATA 6Gbps interface . `` The Cherryville product will be a no compromise solution , '' said Winslow . `` It will have better sequential and better random than any prior SSD from Intel and will lead the industry . '' All those other drives run with the latest and greatest SandForce memory controller , the SF 2281 . Intel studiously left off what controller it was using for this newest drive , despite releasing news about the proprietary Intel controller on its later Smart Response-based Hawley Creek mSATA SSD . So you 'd think it was n't going to be an Intel controller in the Cherryville product ; so whose controller could it be ? There 's a possibility that it will use a Marvell controller similar to the SATA 6Gbps Intel 510 edition SSD , though that would n't necessarily give it the performance lead Winslow is confident of . More likely Intel is avoiding Marvell or its own controller 's for its high-end consumer SSD and jumping on the SandForce bandwagon with some seriously funky firmware to give it that boost . The drive will be out in a few short months mind – we should have samples in mid-October – and we 'll know for sure then , but it could be a landmark moment for both Intel SSDs .

It 's been an interesting week for tech news . First , Microsoft took the wraps off Windows 8 ; then , Intel announced that Google would be optimising Android for its mobile processors and talked about its next generation Haswell and Broadwell CPUs . Or to put it another way ... fight ! It 's impossible to look at Microsoft and Intel 's announcements without thinking of two companies beginning with A : Apple and ARM . Apple is a huge threat to Microsoft - it effectively owns the tablet market as well as the luxury PC market , and its talk of the post-PC era is n't something Microsoft wants to hear - and ARM is a threat to Intel . ARM-based chips power all kinds of tablets , including Apple ones , and could end up powering Apple 's computers too . To take on the A-firms , it seems , Microsoft and Intel are bringing their A-game . Of course , in any battle there 's the risk of collateral damage . In this case , Microsoft and Intel 's moves could end up upsetting Microsoft and Intel . But that 's OK . They 're big enough to take it - and the results could be really interesting . As we 've seen from yesterday 's Windows 8 reveal , Microsoft is taking this tablet thing seriously . It wants you to buy a Windows 8 tablet rather than an iPad 3 , a Windows 8 PC rather than a 2012 MacBook Whatever , and if that means upsetting Intel so be it : Windows 8 kit wo n't necessarily be Intel kit , as the new operating system runs on ARM processors too . Windows Phone is on ARM already . The benefit for us ? A wider range of Windows-powered devices . Intel , meanwhile , wants you to buy an Intel-powered tablet , smartphone or PC rather than an ARM-based one , and if that means upsetting Microsoft so be it . If Microsoft 's going to get pally with ARM processors , it seems , then Intel 's going to get pally with Android . The benefit for us ? A wider range of Intel-powered options . I like it when tech firms fight . Like guilty parents bribing the kids with shiny presents after a Shiraz-fuelled shoutfest , the result tends to be more shiny toys for all of us - and as a paid-up gadget geek , I like shiny toys . Bring your popcorn , because this battle 's going to be brilliant . To reverse the Aliens vs . Predator tagline : whoever wins ... we win .
It can be mighty confusing when chip giants release new hardware , under code names , relatively shortly after the part it 's meant to replace , so here 's a quick run down of what 's new and what 's not in Intel 's newest CPU . Well , it 's still the same style of CPU and GPU combo that made Intel 's Sandy Bridge such an impressive wee beastie in the first place . `` Sandy Bridge was a pretty major platform repartitioning with a lot of things integrated on die . We retained a lot of the goodness that Sandy Bridge brought forward , '' said Varghese George , chief architect for Ivy Bridge , in today 's tech insight into the new processor . There will be a similar number of product offerings along the same line as Sandy Bridge in terms of SKUs , so we can expect the same sort of product line up in terms of i3 , i5 and i7 variants including the K-series . Ivy Bridge also retains the same Ring architecture that brings the CPU and GPU components together on die and unfortunately puts a limit on the overclocking side . So it 's still going to be a case of upping the multipliers and not the bus speed . And only then if you 've got one of the unlocked K-series chips in the first place . It has also retained the same socket configuration making it backward compatible with the previous generation . Ideally that should mean any ol ' Sandy Bridge mobo will be compatible with this new chip . That may not necessarily work in practice for all Intel 6-series motherboards , even with a firmware update , but that remains to be seen . Well , actually quite a lot . For a start the entire processor , GPU part too , will be manufactured on the 22nm production process . That means higher performance and lower power . Combined with the lower power coming from the tighter lithography , thanks mostly to those much vaunted Tri-gate transistors , there 's also a bunch of new power management goodies to go with it . The main crux of this is the scalable feature set , including configurable Thermal Design Point ( TDP ) and Low Power Mode . These two are mainly to help OEMs design more scalable systems around the same architecture . For example they will be able to set a system up using three separate TDPs ; 'TDP Up ' , Nominal and 'TDP Down ' . If the machine in question has a lower thermal envelope then using the chip in the lower power state will save on super-heated chips . Interestingly Intel has also incorporated more overclocking goodness into Ivy Bridge . You still have the locked multipler/K-series divide , but on the unlocked chips there is now increased maximum ratio support , moving the bar from x57 up to x63 . It has also introduced more dynamic overclocking , allowing the ratio to be changed on the fly without the need to reboot the machine . This lends itself perfectly then to the application-based overclocking tools over the good ol ' BIOS . On the memory side too things have changed , with much more granularity involved in adjusting your DRAM 's frequency . Where once you had to shift the speed of your memory in 266MHz increments you can now move in 200MHz jumps . That small change could mean a lot in OC terms . The big change for Ivy Bridge though is in the graphics core on board . Where the CPU component follows perfectly on the tick tock Intel development model , with the simpler die-shrink tick following the more in-depth architectural revamp tock , the GPU part is being characterised as a 'tick plus ' . The new HD graphics in Ivy Bridge represents far more than just a die-shrink down to 22nm . Because of the introduction of DirectX 11 support the whole GPU has effectively been redesigned . With the latest graphical API demands Intel has had to incorporate both Tessellation engines and Compute shaders into the mix . With this redesign comes a far more modular GPU design , allowing the HD graphics of Ivy Bridge to be far more closely tailored to the individual SKUs . With Sandy Bridge desktop part you had two options , either the HD 2000 in the standard chips or the HD 3000 in the K-series alone . That 's changed now with Intel assuring us there will be lower power Ivy Bridge processors with the high-end Ivy Bridge graphics core on board . So it will no longer purely be the domain of the top chips in the family . On Sandy Bridge there was more of a disconnect with only the top-end K-series chips have the top-end graphics . Yes , those CPUs that were more than likely going to be paired with a discrete card anyway . The Ivy Bridge GPU also comes with its own L3 cache too . This means the graphics side of the processor no longer have to keep calling on the shared cache of the CPU side . But it 's not just in the technicalities that things have changed on the graphics side , performance is apparently well up . `` Do n't be surprised if the performance is significantly higher , '' said Intel Senior Fellow and grumpy graphics guru , Tom Piazza . Piazza was n't able to talk numbers unfortunately with the chip still six months or so away , but he did say that both the QuickSync video and 3D gaming performance where very much on the rise . So things are looking impressive for Intel 's next , next chip . After all , we 've got the seriously high-performance Sandy Bridge Extreme parts coming in a month or two to whet our appetite .

Intel predicts the increased demand for what it calls the 'compute continuum ' will result in a mind blowing 1,200 quintillion transistors in the world by the year 2015 . Today there are more than 4 billion connected devices in the world and that move to mobility has created `` an unprecedented demand for the most fundamental enabler for the digital age – the transistor , '' said Paul Otellini , Intel CEO , today at the Intel Developer Forum . In terms of the number of transistors this transition to pervasive connectivity led to a huge surge in the early 2000 's , reaching around 5 quintillion transistors by 2005 . In the five years since then demand has grown exponentially , by around fifteen times , to around 80 quintillion by the end of 2010 . The continued explosion of connected devices and the subsequent data centres needed to cater for them has driven this continual rise . Intel estimates the number of transistors needed to store , manage and interpret the data we 'll all create over the next five years will take us past the one sextillion mark . That 's 1,000 quintillions . `` This makes the transistor usage over the last three decades look like a flat line by comparison , '' said Otellini .
Google and Intel today announced a continuation of its 'strategic alliance ' specifically aimed at making sure its Android operating system is `` optimised the best it possibly can be for the Intel architecture . '' A rather flustered-looking Andy Rubin , Senior VP Mobile for Google , took to the stage with Intel CEO , Paul Otellini , at this year 's Intel Developer Forum here in San Francisco to make the announcement . Rubin announced that going forward all future releases of Android will be optimised , from the kernel level upwards , for the Intel mobile platform . `` Every time we collaborate with Google good things come out of it , '' said Otellini . Intel is targeting the first half of 2012 for the release of its first Medfield-based smartphones via multiple worldwide manufacturers . Otellini also stated that all of the first Intel smartphones will be Android-based . Medfield is the 32nm next generation of Atom processors specifically designed for the smartphone , system-on-a-chip ( SoC ) ecosystem . It is the follow-up chip to last year 's Moorestown Atom CPU which was based on the 45nm production process . Intel today showed a functioning , full reference design of an Intel Android smartphone , saying that such devices had already been shipped out to manufacturers to play with . Otellini however would n't be drawn on which manufacturers had taken an active interest in releasing such products . In a separate briefing here at IDF 2011 Intel also showed off a functional Medfield-based tablet running Android Honeycomb . It was an 8.9mm thin reference device and Intel is ready now to ship them out to manufacturers to use themselves . Intel has long been talking up the prospect of Atom-based smartphones and tablets , but with the last generation , Moorestown , it failed to grab any serious mobile design wins . This time it hopes things will be different with the Medfield Atom . With Microsoft announcing the support of the ARM architecture for its next version of its flagship OS , Windows 8 , it 's interesting to see Intel cosying up quite significantly with Google in the mobile market .

Intel has spoken out about rumours that it is ditching its MeeGo OS , originally developed in partnership with Nokia , stating that it is staying committed to the platform . Rumours had surfaced earlier this week suggesting that Samsung was eyeing up MeeGo - while Doug Fisher , general manager of Intel 's software division , would n't comment on the rumour , he did say : `` We 're very open to other companies participating and helping us shape the next version of an open platform , '' while apparently alleging Intel 's allegiance to the MeeGo software by stressing that it is `` fully committed '' to the OS . This 'full commitment ' may come as a surprise to the industry insiders who claim that Intel is on the verge of ditching the beleaguered OS . Fisher was speaking at an event intended to highlight Intel 's soirees into the world of software , having bought McAfee and several smaller names earlier this year . `` Software companies are reshaping the industry today , `` he said . `` We 've recognized the critical need for software . The expectation is this will continue with further acquisitions around software . '' From PC World

It 's been an awfully , awfully long time coming . But AMD has announced that its all-new Bulldozer PC processor is finally shipping to customers . Question is , do the delays hint at a troubled architecture or can AMD 's new CPU architecture sock it to Intel and make things competitive again ? AMD 's original idea was to launch Bulldozer several years ago . But when it comes to new CPU launches , things rarely seem to go to plan for AMD . The launch of the first quad-core AMD Phenom CPU , for instance , was an outright fiasco . Strictly speaking , of course , Bulldozer is the first properly new CPU from AMD since the Athlon of 2003 . So , it 's perhaps not surprising that Bulldozer 's roll out has n't been perfectly smooth . However , the spectre of the calamitous Phenom launch is certainly worrying . Phenom , too , was delayed and was woefully off the pace for performance when it finally arrived . Now , it 's true that most of Bulldozer 's delay has been due to a strategic overhaul which saw it realigned from 45nm to 32nm . But word on the street is that AMD has been through several steppings in an effort to get the chip running up to expectations . What 's not clear is whether the problems involve the routine challenge of getting the clockspeeds up and running or if there is a more fundamental issue with the architecture . Given Bulldozer 's radical design , it 's the latter that poses both the greatest danger and offers the greatest promise , because Bulldozer 's architecture pretty much tears up the rule book for CPU design and challenges the very notion of what a CPU core is . Instead of conventional CPU cores , Bulldozer has modules . Each module contains a pair of integer engines and a shared floating engine . The overall goal is to create a unit that delivers the performance of two conventional cores using die space closer to a single core . That should mean more performance for less money . It also means the arrival of Bulldozer will bring with it a new marketing war . At launch , the first Bulldozer processor , currently codenamed Zambezi but due to branded AMD FX , will sport four Bulldozer modules . However , it 's clear from AMD 's PR material that Zambezi will be marketed as `` the world 's first eight-core desktop CPU . '' Now , we also know that Intel 's next high performance processor , codenamed Sandy Bridge E , will stick with six cores . So , that 's eight cores vs six cores and an easy PR win for AMD . Except Intel will no doubt counter with the argument that AMD 's cores are n't proper cores and claim that Zambezi is really a glorified quad-core chip with eight-core pretensions . If Intel can also point to superior performance from its supposedly inferior six-core processor , well , it will be handbags at dawn . Still , what really matters is how the Bulldozer architecture performs , not how you count the cores . Leaked benchmarks purporting to show Zambezi performance suggest it will be competitive with Intel 's best quad-core chips but slower than Intel 's six-core technology . If so , that will represent a big step forward for AMD . More importantly , it will make for a much more competitive market . With AMD finally shipping Bulldozer-based chips , the good news is that we 'll know the truth very soon .

Processor giant Intel has announced a whopping 16 new Sandy Bridge chips , as well as price cuts for its existing desktop line up . Of the 16 chips , 11 are desktop processors for the LGA 1155 socket , with the remaining five designed for mobile devices . The desktop chips range from the single-core Celeron G440 at $ 37 USD ( £23 ) up to the quad-core I5-2320 which costs $ 177 USD ( £110 ) . In the mobile sector , the Core i7-2960XM is a quad-cored chip with HyperThreading clocked at 2.70GHz , with Turbo taking it up to 3.7GHz . The Core i7-2960XM will drop at a wallet-busting $ 1,096 USD ( £680 ) , so we can expect to see it appear in expensive , high-end gaming laptops . At the bottom end of the Sandy Bridge mobile line up is the dual-core B840 Celeron , which will cost a mere $ 86 USD ( £53 ) . In addition to the new chips , price cuts have been announced for current Core i5 processors , with most being reduced be two to six per cent . The Core i7-2600S , for example , will drop by $ 12 USD from $ 306 to $ 294 . Intel 's pricing of its Core chips has been notoriously high , so it 's good to see the chip supremo move into same low-price territory as rival AMD . via Tom 's Hardware

Intel looks like it 's sealed the fate of the MeeGo operating system it developed in association with Nokia , with reports that it 's 'temporarily discontinuing development ' of the OS . According to Digitimes , a lack of enthusiasm from tablet and smartphone manufacturers means the chip company has decided to focus on Android and Windows Phone-based hardware as it looks to nab a larger piece of the colossal portable devices market . Intel has said that it wo n't comment on the information from Digitimes ' industry sources , and that it remains committed to MeeGo as a community-based OS - although without Nokia 's backing , it 's unlikely to be able to make a big success of the platform . The message from Nokia has been mixed over the future of MeeGo - on the one hand , it 's keen to keep the UI and patents it 's gained from working with the OS and refuses to say that it 's giving up on the platform - even going as far as stating that it will release software updates for years . But on the other hand it 's been scaling back the operation heavily and wo n't be making another MeeGo-based phone , even withdrawing plans to offer the MeeGo-powered N9 on sale in the UK . So it seems the non-starting MeeGo platform is going to stay that way - if you want to bag yourself a piece of mobile phone history we suggest you head over to the continent and pick up a Nokia N9 - it 's going to be a one-off by the looks of things .

Chip giant Intel has sneakily released an upgraded Sandy Bridge CPU - the Core i7 2700K - just weeks after AMD launched its supposedly Intel-challenging Bulldozer chip . The chip is n't a huge upgrade over its predecessor , the 2600K , offering only a small increase of 100MHz to 3.5GHz in operating frequency . In turn , this lets the chip reach speeds for 3.9GHz in Turbo mode . Otherwise the chip 's much the same , with four cores , up to eight threaded Hyper-Threading and an 8MB cache . As before , the Core i7 's multiplier is unlocked for easy overclocking . Intel has also announced price drops for three of its lower-end chips . The Core i2-2120 and Pentium G630 and G850 will be priced at $ 117 ( £73 ) , $ 64 ( £40 ) and $ 75 ( £47 ) respectively . The Core-i7 2700K is now in stock at Scan Computers for £287 , £87 more than AMD 's latest chip . Quite why Intel has n't made its usual song and dance about the new chip is unknown - it could be that it 's such an incremental upgrade that it 's not worth promoting , or that it 's going to big up the processor once the wind disappears from AMD 's Bulldozer sails . via Anandtech

`` I think we sucked at getting consumer visits , '' admitted Peter Biddle , general manager for Intel 's AppUp with typical frankness . Biddle was explaining to developers that only 350,000 users had signed up for the app store and they 'd only downloaded 810,000 apps between them . By this time next year , he aims to have `` six million engaged users – and if not , maybe Intel should just fire me . '' That sounds like a fairly tall order , especially with Microsoft announcing the Windows Store for Metro apps in Windows 8 . `` That gives us a year to build a viable and thriving app store economy , '' he says diplomatically , but also points out `` right now it 's still blog posts and great presentations . '' For both Intel and Microsoft , getting into services like app stores – and in Intel 's case , the services like billing and location to let other people build their own niche app stores using AppUp – are crucial because the way technology companies make money is changing . `` We 've been looking at trends . We compared the profit sources in 2010 on the PC ecosystem - from standalone devices to silicon to application software to operating system software to services - and the profit pool in 2010 on PCs for those was basically level . `` It was a few billion here or there but it was somewhere between 10 and 20 billion profit for every one of those . Fast forward to the projected profit on the same things on devices in 2015 and the middle of that graph is scorched earth . `` The profit pool on operating systems on devices in 2015 is one billion , the profit pool in apps is about a billion dollars , the profit pool in silicon is good - but it is n't anything compared to how high devices on one end and services on the other are . '' Those figures do n't just explain why Intel wants its own iTunes equivalent ( although Biddle calls going `` head to head with Apple at their own game '' suicide , he suggests that having `` ITunes 500 times bigger than it is today '' is n't the best way for users to find good apps or for developers to make a living ) . He believes they also explain some otherwise puzzling behaviour by Apple and Google . `` Why would Apple drive the profit revenue down on the apps business in their own marketplace ? A simple answer is they did n't want there to be room for another Microsoft on devices . You start off in the beginning and say 'we 're going to make the average sales price $ 1.47 ; try to build an office business there . You ca n't . '' `` When you look at Google and you say why did they make the operating system free on devices ? There 's a bunch of other perfectly good reasons for it , but Google 's average revenue per unit is about $ 12-13 per year per user on devices . `` Not only did you take away the every-three-years refresh cycle , approximately $ 45 OEM licence fee you get in the PC business on operating systems and made that zero… You took all that money and put it in your own pocket . It 's a beautiful example of look at your business , double down on your business and destroy other people 's - and if you can do it with the same magic trick , then of course you do that . `` Beyond patents , why would Google buy Motorola ? Because they are sitting on top of a massively good position on services looking across the valley of death at devices which is the only other business that looks like it 's as tall , viable , healthy and thriving with the same kind of returns as they 've got . They 're looking over there and going 'Apple has a huge chunk of that devices profit pool , how do we keep them over there ? ' . Then you go back and stand on the Apple ivory tower and look across the valley of death at the services business , and you go 'iCloud ! ' How do you try to make Google stay the hell over there ? Well you try to make them defensive on their core value . '' Where does that leave Microsoft ? According to Biddle ( who used to work on the Windows team ) , `` the only two options , based on that trend , are to become a services player , a vertically integrated devices player or both . If you look at Windows 8 , it is both ; it 's the services operating system and it 's the integrated devices operating system bundled up together . '' The question is whether Microsoft can pull off the Apple-esque level of integration required to succeed . `` Microsoft historically has been its own worst enemy in creating great buttoned up Apple-class solutions because there 's always somebody who manages to make you compromise and as soon as you compromise you 're not Jobsing it - you 're back in PC land . I have absolutely no doubt there is the talent inside Microsoft to build truly kickass top to bottom experiences . It 's just will they be allowed to ? '' AppUp was initially designed to showcase apps that were good for low-performance netbooks , and it will support Tizen ( the HMTL5-focussed replacement for MeeGo ) , but as netbook sales slump in favour of tablets Intel is focussing on PCs – which still sell a million a day , compared to the 17 million tablets predicted to sell in the whole of 2011 . Why is n't that a million new AppUp users a day ? `` One of the frustrating things about the fact that we 've been so focused this past year on tablets which if you look around have n't shipped , is that it means that we missed being on the first small wave of ultrabooks as a preinstall option . `` Our first PC-centric release is coming in Q4 . Less than 30 % of our users are on netbooks today , so everybody is running it on PC . But – the UI is n't right for PC , we did n't really source the apps with PCs in mind , there 's a whole set of features - people expect a more full-fledged PC experience with social media integration that is n't there… all those things need to get added . '' AppUp is going to be ubiquitous on ultrabooks , he predicts . `` We 're going to make it hard to even get an ultrabook without AppUp on.There 's a lot of ultrabooks shipping next year . `` And we think - just like the Mac App Store on MacBooks and MacBook Airs in particular , delivering real value on that form factor- we think AppUp has a great opportunity on that form factor , [ if we have ] great apps that take advantage of the hardware .

Intel 's upcoming Sandy Bridge-E processors will be the company 's first to ship with an all-in-one liquid cooling system . The coolers , manufactured by Asetek but branded by Intel , will ship as part of a bundle with the Core i7 3000-series processors , and will also be available separately . Like CoolIT 's Advanced Liquid Cooling , the cooler consists of an external 120mm fan - which sits at the back of your PC 's case - as well as a pump and a heatsink to keep things nice and chilly . It marks Intel 's first move away from traditional air cooling , and the all-in-one design means users do n't need a City and Guilds plumbing certificate to liquid-cool their PCs . The cooler also means Intel is keen for users to overclock its forthcoming super-chip to extreme temperatures and frequencies . The standalone cooler will be compatible with the Sandy Bridge-E 's LGA2011 platform , as well as LGA1155 , LGA1156 and LGA1366 platforms . There 's no word on whether it has user-modifiable fan speeds , though - a feature we loved in the original CoolIT system . We 've seen liquid cooling become more common in recent years , and with prices of all-in-one systems dropping considerably it 's become the bedroom enthusiast 's method of choice .

Chip giant Intel is to drop out of the smart TV market due to a lack of demand for internet-enabled flatscreens . The company will fold its TV-based Digital Home Group , and move the engineers onto tablet , smartphone and Ultrabook development . Intel 's Atom CE4100 chip currently powers D-Link 's Boxee Box and Logitech 's Revue digital media players , as well as Sony 's Google-powered televisions . But it 's set to be the last chip of its kind , with competitor ARM likely to fill the void Intel leaves . `` This is a business decision where we 're taking those resources and applying them to corporate priorities , '' Claudine Mangano , an Intel official , told Bloomberg . Those priorities look increasingly like tablets and smartphones , where the Digital Home Group 's knowledge could be harnessed to create portable devices with smart TV functionality . The CE4100 will continue to be sold and supported by Intel , and it will also remain - albeit more anonymously - in set top boxes . By all rights Google TV should have followed in the lucrative footsteps of Android , but we were less than impressed when we reviewed it . Although there 's still potential in the smart TV format , the massive popularity of tablets makes it seem like Intel is doing the right thing . via engadget

Intel 's booth at CEATEC may have been a showcase of products already in the market , but it still had some fascinating concept kit – including an augmented reality clothing booth . The booth is for those too lazy to try on multiple clothes . Instead , all you need to do is stick on a green t-shirt and Intel 's technology does all the work for you . Once the t-shirt is on , you can choose a number of different styles to 'virtually ' try on , until you find the right one for you . An Intel spokesperson told TechRadar that the demo was there to show off the capabilities of the company 's Xeon chipset . Another demo of augmented reality , Intel-style was one of the more bizarre we had seen , that of a virtual panda . While we feel sorry for the booth girl who had to wear the ridiculous cubed hat , it all made sense when she was next to a massive TV screen . Intel had rigged it so that her cubed headwear controlled a virtual giant panda on the screen . As demos go , this is one that will give us nightmares for life but it is one that shows off the potential of augmented reality – albeit through the medium of pandas . Well , it is CEATEC .

The arrival of tablets and lightweight , high-end 'Ultrabooks ' has meant that the future for the netbook is looking rather bleak . This is according to Kas Yoshida , president of Intel Japan , who told TechRadar and other journalists that the netbook form factor could well be on the way out . Fresh from his keynote speech at CEATEC 2011 in Japan , Yoshida explained : `` The netbook was a very interesting product as it enabled a lower price point which helped expand the [ PC ] user base . `` However , it did not grow as much as we expected . It turned out to be a low-end booster rather than a focus on useability . '' Speaking about the Japanese market , Yoshida said that there 's now much more of an interest in a higher performance , rather than the lower performance offered by netbooks . It is now all about the `` thin and light '' of the what Intel has dubbed the 'Ultrabook ' , and the performance and low cost offered by Core i3 and even i5 chips . `` In Japan , 70 per cent [ of chips shipped ] are the high-end processors . So the netbook was n't really reaching the performance we wanted . `` Then the i3 and i5 chips came along and the price was similar [ to netbook processors ] , this shifted away the demand . They are still selling but there is a definite shifting away . '' When asked if we have seen the end of the netbook , Yoshida noted : `` It is hard to say whether the netbook is finished – price point is still very important with users . ''
Intel chips are set to come to the smartphone market in 2012 , but the company is n't worried about being last to the party . Speaking to TechRadar at CEATEC 2011 , Kas Yoshida , president of Intel Japan , said that despite taking its time entering the smartphone market , it will offer up a better performance than its rivals . `` We want to be number one for performance , '' explained Yoshida . `` There is more and more demand for apps that need performance , so we need to be good at that but we still need to catch-up with the Android eco-system . '' As well as its alliance with Google – back in September it was announced that Google will be optimised for Intel chips – Intel also believes that the next generation of Symbian phone Tizen OS , will present an opportunity to show just what Intel is capable of in the phone market . `` Tizen is part of our phone roadmap . We always believe in an open environment and we encourage the software industry to thrive in this environment . '' Although we asked when we will see Tizen phones hit the shelves – considering the problems Intel had with MeeGo – Yoshida did n't give much away but hinted : `` Tizen products are not fixed yet be we hope to offer something soon .

HP is in discussions with Intel to buy off the company 's Palm assets – the most important of which is WebOS . In a week where HP 's financial numbers revealed that WebOS , the acquisition of Palm and the running costs to produce the HP TouchPad had hit $ 3.3 billion , it is thought that Intel is the latest to be interested in buying WebOS . The sheer amount of cash that HP has put into its OS and tablet venture , however , does mean that when it does eventually sell off its WebOS assets it will make a massive loss . While Palm is looking to sell off WebOS , one of its prerequisites for the deal seems to be that it still wants to have a WebOS licence for its printer range . We 're not sure why this would be a stumbling block for a company that is eager to rid itself of software that is losing the company money on a daily basis , but VentureBeat believes this is a major factor in the talks taking place . 2011 will be a year HP wants to forget . In August the company announced it was ending production of WebOS hardware , less than 18 months after it had bought Palm and that it was thinking of pulling out of the PC market completely . By October , the company had a new CEO in place and had confirmed it was keeping the PC business but remained set on selling WebOS . Intel is a company that is still reeling from the demise of MeeGo , so WebOS could well be of interest , so we are pegging this rumour as quite likely : From VentureBeat and SlashGear

Forty years ago today , Intel introduced something amazing : the 4004 , the first commercially available microprocessor . A 4-bit , 1/10th-MHz chip does n't sound like much today , but it was revolutionary : as Intel recalls , it `` delivered the same computing power as the first electronic computer built in 1946 , which filled an entire room . '' The 4004 got off to an unimpressive start - a manufacturing error meant that the first batch did n't work , the 4004 itself was destined for an unglamorous life inside Japanese calculators and rivals did n't see anything worth getting excited about - but Intel 's then-CEO Gordon Moore called it `` one of the most revolutionary products in the history of mankind . '' He was n't exaggerating . Without the microprocessor , the world as we know it today would n't exist . The 4004 was a direct ancestor of today 's super-speedy , multi-core marvels : it begat the 8-bit 8008 processor , which in turn led to 1974 's 8080 - the processor that laid the foundations for the X86 architecture that Intel still uses today . Intel created the first commercial microprocessor , but it was n't alone for long : then , as now , Intel soon had multiple competitors , some of whose products delivered superior performance . Intel 's success was n't just about technology , though : it was about really smart negotiating too . The 4004 was designed on behalf of the calculator firm Busicom , and when Busicom demanded deep discounts Intel agreed - but in exchange , it got the right to sell 4004s in other markets . Intel repeated the trick with the 8008 : its customer , Computer Terminal Corporation , had designed both the chip and its instruction set - it was known at CTC as the 1201 - but when the chip did n't meet CTC 's own performance goals , the firm decided to use a different processor in its terminals and signed over its designs to Intel . The 8008 would soon power the world 's first real microcomputer , the Sac State 8008 , and the first commercial personal computers , the French Micral N and the US SCELBI-8H . Its descendant , the 8088 , would become the heart of the IBM PC . Like many tech triumphs , Intel 's success was a mix of luck , clever negotiating , competitors ' mis-steps and being in the right place at the right time , but that does n't make it any less of a triumph : while lots of firms claim to have changed the world , Intel actually did it . From smartphones to sat-navs , computers to cars , Xboxes to X-ray machines , the 4004 's grandchildren make the world work .
Intel is celebrating the 40th birthday of the first commercially available microprocessor – with the fondly remembered Intel 4004 arriving on this day in 1971 . The microprocessor has fundamentally changed the world that we live in , and it has come a long way since its arrival , with the eerily accurate Moore 's Law dictating that every two years will see processing power double . Intel points out that this means today 's second gen Intel Core processors offer up 350,000 times the performance , with each transistor using 5,000 times less energy . Fortunately the price of the transistor has dropped by a factor of about 50,000 , allowing the microprocessor to proliferate in our everyday consumer electronics . So what of the future ? `` The sheer number of advances in the next 40 years will equal or surpass all of the innovative activity that has taken place over the last 10,000 years of human history , '' said Justin Rattner , Intel chief technology officer . The immediate future for Intel will see the adoption of the 22nm manufacturing process and the arrival of 3D Tri-Gate transistors . But for now , we can celebrate 40 years of the commercially available microprocessor , and laugh about how unsophisticated things used to be in the 1970s .

This morning Intel launched its all-singing , all-number crunching Sandy Bridge E processors and brand-spanking new X79 motherboard chipset . It 's not messing around ; these are the fastest desktop CPUs that have ever passed across our test benches . The flagship CPU , the Intel Core i7 3960X , is right up there at the very top-end of processors , and all six-cores of its updated Sandy Bridge E architecture can be yours for nigh-on £750 . So it 's no value proposition then . There is not a little controversy surrounding it though as despite being sold as a straight six-core CPU the literature Intel has given reviewers clearly shows two dormant or dead CPU cores unused on the die . We 've gone into more depth about this in our full Intel Core i7 3960X review . Still , it is a lightening-fast processor capable of the sort of raw computational prowess you wont see outside of the server environment . It 's also no slouch in the overclocking department either , our review chip managed 4.8GHz in Asus 's Sabertooth X79 motherboard . It 's not just the top chip that is an overclocking beast , and to demonstrate that we 've been gleefully playing with YOYOTech 's XDNA Platinum PC . That 's running the cheaper , mid-range Intel Core i7 3930K Sandy Bridge E running at 4.4GHz out of the box . The other stand out feature of the new Sandy Bridge E processors and X79 chipset is the support for the next generation of memory ; quad-channel DDR3 . Quite what improvements this gives , in real-world terms , over triple-channel DDR3 is rather intangible , and to be honest more indicative of the platform 's server roots than any importance on the desktop . If you want the full low-down on Intel 's latest offerings , then look no further . Intel Core i7 3960X : If you want the fastest processor on the planet , look no further . Most impressive is the additional overclocking headroom Intel has delivered over the old six-core chip . Platform upgrades including more PCI-E lanes and SATA 6Gbps are welcome , too . Asus Sabertooth X79 : Asus 's RoG boards are all very well if money 's no object . Back in the real world , the Sabertooth series offers a much more realistic compromise between performance , features and price . The chipset cooling and overclocking support look very solid . We certainly squeezed some great numbers out of the new Core i7-3960X . YOYOTech XDNA Platinum : With the XDNA Platinum sat on your desktop , purring away quietly as it does , with its cold-cathode tubes illuminating the clean lines of the immaculate interior , even £2,500 worth of buyer 's remorse will have a hard job up against such an impressive machine .

Intel is working on a new CPU line that is designed exclusively for tablets . It looks as though Intel 's upcoming mobile chip , codenamed Medfield , will be making its way to smartphones but steering clear of slates with this new tablet chip taking its place . Digitimes is reporting that the new tablet processors will be particularly focused on thermal design power ( TDP ) and performance . The occasionally-reliable Digitimes has heard the news from an anonymous source , so do n't take any of this as gospel . These mysterious sources also added that the company will launch 32nm Saltwell , 22nm Silvermont and 14nm Airmont chipsets over the course of the next three years . Intel is also looking to reduce power consumption of its processors , with the Medfield chips and these unnamed tablet chips set to come down to 10W in the next two years . On the one hand , it 's entirely believable – but on the other hand , the rumours have come from Digitimes , so we 'll stick with the middling 'quite likely ' on the TechRadar rumourometer for now .

Rumours on Friday suggest that Intel 's first venture into the smartphone business will take place at CES with the launch of an LG Android phone . The Korean Times has it on good authority from sources at both companies that the eagerly-awaited phones boasting the new Medfield SoC will arrive at the Las Vegas tech show . `` LG Electronics will produce Intel 's first Android smartphones that use Intel 's own mobile platform . The device will be shown at the CES , '' according to an unnamed 'top-ranking ' executive at LG . Intel 's top man in Korea Lee Hee-sung told the publication that company CEO Paul Otellini will take to the stage to reveal the device , which could go on sale as soon as March . He said : `` Intel 's chief executive Paul Otellini will release Intel 's first Android smartphone using our own platform at the CES . '' An Intel/LG partnership would represent a second attempt from the company 's to forge a partnership based around Google 's Android smartphone platform . The pair announced an Android device as CES last year which was later canned due to a perceived lack of marketability . CES gets underway on January 9th at the Las Vegas Convention Centre .

Intel has gone on a patent buying spree , snapping up 190 patents and 170 patent applications from Real Networks , including those related to music streaming . Setting the chip company back $ 120 million ( £76.5 million ) , Intel thinks the patents will work in its favour as it expands its mobile product lines . As the company puts it , the patents will allow it to `` continue to offer richer experiences and innovative solutions to end users across a wide spectrum of devices , including through Ultrabook devices , smartphones and digital media '' . Real Networks , meanwhile , will still be able to continue using some of the patents in its current and future digital music products as part of the deal . Other patents included in the deal relate to creation of video codecs that allow efficient exchange of filmed content over networks . As well as boosting Intel 's own products , the portfolio should bolster the company in case of being sucked into the legal wranglings over intellectual property rights that plagued the mobile industry in 2011 .

Tablets running Windows 8 on Intel architecture may be priced too high to succeed in the tablet market , with rumoured pricing hitting the $ 600- $ 800 ball park because neither Windows nor chip-maker Intel are willing to drop their prices . In the UK , that converts to £400 to £530 ( but likely to be higher with tax ) . While this kind of price point works if you 're hawking , say , an iPad , Microsoft will have a pretty tricky job on its hands to lure Apple slate-lovers away from iOS and over to Windows 8-lite for the same money . The reason neither company wants to go lower on prices is partly good old-fashioned greed , but also because they are loathe to `` damage '' pricing in the PC market ; cheaper tablets could force down the prices of PCs , notebooks , software - otherwise known as Microsoft 's bread and butter . Digitimes reckons that if Intel is n't careful , manufacturers are likely to opt for ARM-based architecture from Qualcomm , Nvidia and Texas Instruments to avoid the higher prices . While this might be a more wallet-friendly approach , it may leave you feeling a bit short-changed on specs and performance . Not that any Windows 8 tablets have actually launched yet , despite a glut of prototypes hitting CES 2012 ; check back in the latter half of the year . From Digitimes via BGR

Intel 's 'Medfield ' Atom chip has been a long time coming , and we first reported on its announcement back in February 2011 after Mobile World Congress . Now we know it 's called the Intel Atom Z2460 , and is at the heart of the new Lenovo K800 smartphone released today at CES 2012 . After falling behind ARM in the chase for mobile supremacy , Medfield represents Intel 's intention to challenge the market with a new kind of processor . It 's a single core chip based on the more familiar Atom processor , which is more commonly found on netbooks , and nettops , offering low power at a low cost . Medfield is an evolution of Penwell , sharing most of the architecture . The processor market has thrived on the message that 'more cores equal more power ' and with dual-core smartphones now the norm , and quad-core tablets being released throughout 2012 , many will baulk at Medfield 's single core announcement . However , there 's more to Medfield than meets the eye . Low power consumption is a huge part of Intel 's intentions with the Atom Z2460 , and the ability to deliver long battery life , without sacrificing performance , is a key factor in the success of any mobile processor . By opting for a 32nm architecture - which is the world 's first on a smartphone - Intel believes it can deliver the efficiencies its rivals ca n't . The company boasted that Medfield enjoys a 10x lower power leakage than its 45nm rivals , which include the ARM licensed Qualcomm MSM8x60 Snapdragon and Texas Instruments OMAP 4 , but still larger than the forthcoming 28nm Cortex A7 , which is slated for early 2013 . Power and battery life have been huge issues for mobile chip makers , and each has come up with different ways of managing what has become a major complaint for consumers . ARM 's Cortex A7 processor uses a Big.LITTLE concept of running two chips - one powerful , one efficient - and switching smartly between them depending on the task undertaken by the handset . Medfield uses a dynamic range of power states , throttles processor speeds as and when they 're required , with fine grained steps at 100MHz increments . 1.6GHz speeds are only achieved in short 'burst modes ' for the most demanding tasks . Intel says this range of speeds enables it to keep power consumption lower than its rivals . Being derived from a PC processor means that Medfield is the first x86 processor , which brings about a whole new set of challenges for Intel . The first challenge is app support , since the Dalvik and NDK apps found on the Android Market , for example , are n't designed to work on x86 chips . Intel has promised 90 % app support when Medfield phones hit the shelves , and have been busy turning apps into Medfield-compliant programs . The company promised that consumers would n't notice any difference , and that Medfield smartphones would n't have to be annexed to a separate x86 Marketplace . The single-core Intel Atom Z2460 chip is clocked at 1.6GHz , with 512KB of L2 cache memory , which is far faster than the 1.2 GHz Cortex A9 found on many the hero devices of 2012 , such as the Samsung Galaxy S2 . Intel deflected questions about Medfield 's single-core architecture , pointing at other innovations , which help keep performance up with its rivals . Hyperthreading capability is found on Medfield , much like Intel 's lauded full-form PC chip Sandy Bridge , which mimics a dual core chip by enabling the core to work on two processes simultaneously . This speeds up the work done by each core , meaning that processes can be completed quicker , which is really noticeable during video encoding . Any software must have threads written into the code for a processor to take advantage , and it will be interesting to see where Medfield can gain the biggest performance advantages . While Android 's core apps could be engineered to make use of Hyperthreading , it 's not clear whether third-party apps will be , and this is something to look for as the system develops . One cause for concern , however , is that the Intel Atom Z2460 can only handle a maximum screen resolution of 1024 x 768 . With an industry focusing on screen quality , this leaves very little headroom for growth . And as the Samsung Galaxy Nexus already features a screen at this resolution , do n't expect to see Intel-based smartphones exceeding this . TechRadar was treated to an exclusive preview with a reference handset running the Medfield chip at Intel 's Santa Clara headquarters , where the company ran benchmarks against leading handsets . We 'll be holding back judgement until we get the chance to review the Medfield platform ourselves , but Intel 's boasts were backed up by an impressive showing in early tests . The reference handset was 3x faster in BrowserMark than the Samsung Galaxy S2 , which is exciting news for those looking to enjoy rich web experiences on their smartphones . Intel 's benchmarks also recorded its Medfield system to use 50 % less power in 3G mode than the iPhone 4S , which has suffered from complaints over battery life . Battery life seems promising , with Intel claiming 26 hours from the reference handset - a figure that 's 10 % better than the Samsung Galaxy S2 . One of the most exciting Intel demos , however , was the playback of 1080p media from the handset onto a large external display . While high-definition video is promised on many handsets , the reality can be playback with is jumpy at best , and impossible at worst . The Medfield reference phone played 1080p video back seamlessly , even while connected by HDMI . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Liked this ?

Intel has announced the Lenovo K800 is to be the first smartphone featuring an Atom processor . It 's a 4-inch Android smartphone powered by the Intel Atom Z2460 'Medfield ' platform . The Lenovo K800 features an 8 megapixel camera , and has Intel 's Wi-Di technology built in , so you can connect the handset wirelessly to external displays . Lenovo announced the news during Intel CEO Paul Otellini 's keynote here at CES 2012 . Intel has been talking the smartphone talk for what feels like a long time with no design wins to speak of . But it seems things have changed . And it 's not just Lenovo that has stuck its neck out from the ARM crowd . Intel and Motorola also announced the two companies were entering into a `` multi-year , multi-device relationship '' including Moto smartphones featuring Atom running Android . There were no details on the exact nature of any devices from Motorola , but TechRadar understands that the line-up will include a new smartphone and a tablet , and that details will most likely be revealed at Mobile World Congress . The handsets will feature the Atom processor Z2460 platform , formerly known as Medfield . The platform was specifically designed for smartphones and tablets . `` We are delighted to be partnering with Intel to deliver smartphones and tablets based on Intel 's Atom processor to consumers and businesses , '' said Sanjay Jha , CEO of Motorola Mobility . `` Though there are 5 billion mobile subscribers in the world , less than 800 million are using a smartphone today . With Android as the leading smartphone OS globally and advancements in computing technology we see tremendous opportunity for the converged devices market . '' Intel says that `` several smartphones '' based on the new Atom processor are expected to come to market in 2012 . `` The best of Intel computing is coming to smartphones , '' said Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini . `` Our efforts with Lenovo and Motorola Mobility will help to establish Intel processors in smartphones and provide a solid foundation from which to build in 2012 and into the future . '' Otellini added that enabling the `` best mobile experience '' is a priority for Intel . While Lenovo 's partnership with Intel is understandable given the companies ' heritage of designing laptops together , the Motorola collaboration is a real surprise . The partnership with Lenovo is certainly a union of two technology giants that have yet to make an impression in the mobile sphere . If the handset is a success , it could persuade more manufacturers to build Atom based smartphones . There 's no doubt this is a big day for Intel 's ambitions in the smartphone market , but we doubt ARM is quaking in its boots . We 're meeting with ARM tomorrow , so we 'll let you know what it thinks of Intel 's announcement . Intel also demonstrated a referencedesign for smartphonesto speed up development time of Intel Atom-based handsets .

Intel has decided that it wants smartphones to be as powerful as the best in class , and has outed its reference design minimum specification for manufacturers that want to use its chips . To use the Intel Atom processor , the company wants brands to put in elements like a 4.03-inch high resolution screen , an 8MP camera with 1.3Mp front facing option and HD video playback . Intel says : `` To enable faster time to market solutions for OEMs , the Intel Smartphone Reference design offers a complete hardware and software-ready blueprint for the delivery of high performance smartphones based on the Intel Atom Processor . '' We 're not sure why the company is so oddly specific with items like the display size , but the ability to output full HD video over HDMI and NFC , gyroscopes and Wi-Fi all make perfect sense . These will help deliver 'outstanding performance , exceptional graphics and video and optimum power efficiency ' according to Intel . Battery life ? You 'd better be pushing 6 hours of 1080p playback and 45 hours of audio listening through your phones , else the boys will be round . Intel has struggled hugely in the ARM-dominated smartphone arena over the last few years , but hopes that a new wave of hypersupermegaphones ( not actual megaphones , mobile telephones ) will help bring it back to the fore , especially now Android has been optimised to work with its chips .

Intel 's Mooly Eden has insisted that the company 's Ultrabooks are going to get even slimmer - despite some already boasting a thickness of just 18mm . Speaking at the Intel press conference at CES 2012 , Eden spoke at length about Intel 's Ultrabook project and the clear impact it has made on this year 's offerings at CES . Eden insisted that the current prices would drop quickly due to economies of scale , making the ultra-thin laptops more attainable , but also insisted that the thickness was `` only the beginning '' . `` …the big challenge was that if you want to take a 32 or 40mm [ thick ] notebook and translate it to 18mm and read my lips , 18mm is only the beginning - there are many components that need to be changed and manufactured in high volume in order to drive the costs down , '' Eden said . `` The [ target price for Ultrabooks has been ] $ 999 . Our target is to pull it lower collectively . '' Of course , at some point it becomes very difficult to make a computer strong enough when it is so slim , but modern materials have made it more likely . CES has already seen the Huawei Ascend boast a thickness of just 6.68mm , and the growth of OLED has helped screens get thinner still - so it appears that CES 2012 is very much about putting devices on a diet .
The concept notebook with a huge transparent glass palm rest that doubles as a touchscreen that Intel showed off at Computex last year is now a prototype . And it 's going to be a shipping product before Windows 8 comes out . Use the Nikiski like a laptop , with a see-through glass touch pad that stretches almost the whole width of the base . Touch it with a finger and it 's a trackpad , put your palms down on it to type and the larger base of your hand does n't register as a touch so you still get a wrist rest . Close it , turn it over and the touch pad turns into a touchscreen layer to enable you to browse a slimline view of key information such as new emails . AT A GLANCE : See if you have new messages , look up your next meeting or check Facebook without opening the notebook Despite the Metro look of the notification tiles in the interface that appears through the bottom of this glass touchpad , the prototype is n't running Windows 8 , and the first version will launch this year running Windows 7 . `` We 're hoping to get the product out sooner and then we 'll move to Windows 8 , '' Intel 's Peter Adamson told TechRadar . Although he did n't give a release date , to make it worthwhile shipping before Windows 8 comes along , we 're expecting to see the first model by spring or early summer . Some rumours put Intel 's next generation Ivy Bridge chips on the market as soon as April or May , although we do n't know what processor Nikiski will have . The white prototype Nikiski device will not be an Ultrabook , according to Adamson . An Ultrabook version , more like the slim black prototype shown at Computex , will follow later in the year . This first Nikiski will be priced `` close to $ 699 . '' We spotted USB 3 ports , a memory card slot and an HDMI connector on the sides of the wedge-shaped chassis . NOT ULTRABOOK : The first Nikiski model wo n't be an Ultrabook , although it will have the instant-on and long battery life associated with Intel 's powerful laptop-tablet hybrids Adamson is responsible for the Nikiski app , and was guarded about the final features - currently it shows details from your calendar , email , Facebook news feed and more , with Metro-style notification numbers for new messages since you last looked at the app . USB 3 : Power , USB 3 ports , a headphone jack and volume controls run down one side of the Nikiski There 's a Home button to get back to the top level and a Settings button that enables you to change options such as the font size , plus icons showing details like the time and network connectivity . You can turn on the slimline view by swiping your finger over the touch pad to wake it up , or tapping the power button without opening the lid . It appears to use the same lid closing and opening sensors that most laptops use to hibernate ( and a few use to turn on automatically ) to switch between the overview and the same information in a standard desktop view . So if you select an email or a web page through the bottom of the notebook and you ca n't see enough detail ( although as Adamson notes `` you 've got a lot more real estate than on a phone '' ) , you can open the lid to see the message or web page full screen without having to find it again . Touchscreens add to the cost of a notebook and they also take more power , `` but we 've done a lot of work to keep the power usage low '' Adamson told us . To save even more power , the backlight for the two-thirds of the screen you ca n't see when the lid is shut will turn off automatically in the final version . Intel has n't done that for the prototypes , as you can see by the backlight shining through the closed case . TWO THIRDS : Intel plans to turn off the backlight for the area of the screen that 's hidden when the lid is closed - you can see the glow of the full screen in the Nikiski at the right Intel 's Mooley Eden jokingly warned competitors not to copy the palm rejection `` because we 've already patented it '' . That does n't compete with the 'unintentional touch rejection ' patent Microsoft already has , because that 's about Windows interpreting your touch to see if it 's deliberate or an accident . Nor does it compete with any of the other touch rejection patents held by various technology companies , Adamson told us . Here it 's all done by the PC firmware and Windows never sees the touch of your palms . `` We intercept the touch before Windows ever sees it . '' That takes a lot of work , he explained , because `` when you first touch it , your palm does look like a finger [ to the PC ] '' but he says the system can reliably tell the difference , so you wo n't be randomly moving the mouse while you 're typing . THE WEDGE : The angle of the chassis leaves room for an HDMI port and an SD card socket as well as giving the keyboard a reasonable typing angle

Intel 's Mooly Eden began the computing brand 's unexpectedly good CES 2012 press conference by revealing the company has sold over 150 million Sandy Bridge processors since their launch this time last year . He then moved on to talk Ultrabook , Windows 8 and touch on notebooks . Turns out Intel believes we 're not all about the tablet and we 'll be seeing convertible Ultrabooks that run Windows 8 - we saw a prototype waved around with a siding screen , while another had GPS and gyroscope for gaming . There was also a demo of the Intel Nikiski concept , which has a transparent trackpad that doubles as a mini screen so you can preview emails and tweets . If you 're thinking you 've seen this kind of thing before , you 're probably thinking about Windows Vista 's Sideshow . And what a success that was . Touch is high on Intel 's agenda with Windows 8 . `` In the last 30 years , the number of transistors has gone up one million per cent , '' said Eden . `` But if you look at the user interfaces , we did n't do a lot . We did n't have enough computer power to do what people wanted to do . `` There 'd been a lot of experiments , but you did n't have the power [ to make ] natural user interfaces . We 've seen people moving to touch , but for some reason touch skipped the notebook . But it 's not going to skip the Ultrabook any more . `` People do n't want to give away their physical keyboard , they want to enjoy both worlds . '' Apparently 75 Ultrabooks are currently in various stages of design , some of which will be touch-capable . Eden was keen to stress that Intel is also working on getting thinner and lighter Ultrabooks . `` The first impression when we get it to people is 'wow ' . That 's not a technology word . `` But the big challenge was that if you want to take a 32 or 40mm ( thick ) notebook and translate it to 18mm - and read my lips , 18mm is only the beginning - there are many components that need to be changed and manufactured in high volume in order to drive the costs down . The [ target price for Ultrabooks has been ] $ 999 . Our target is to pull it lower collectively . `` The first challenge is the display panel . We 've got it down to 5mm , but we need to get it down to 3mm . And it can be done . We need to look at the battery life . We are building the Ultrabook step-by-step . And then there 's the hard drive , at 9.5mm . We need to work with the ecosystem to make it 7mm . `` We need to look at the motherboard and solder the processor to the motherboard to save on socket size . We designed a new processor that instead of 30W consumes 17W , so the less heat , the smaller the heatsink can be . '' Eden talked up Intel 's involvement in the cost reduction of those components . `` The minute that people saw we were dead serious , the minute that OEMs joined us , the economies of scale kicked in and the price tag [ started ] going down . We are working with them to develop new materials for chassis and you 'll see the price start going down and down . You 'll see Ultrabooks going into the mainstream price points . '' Eden also talked about the power of the DirectX-11 capable Ivy Bridge hybrid CPUs set to debut during 2012 , and showed us a Havok demo running on the hardware . `` I said in the past it 's not going to be 30 per cent or 40 per cent better . `` It 's completely redesigned . Let me whet your appetite . It 's not going to be 50 per cent or 60 per cent or 70 per cent or even 80 per cent . Definitely it 's going to be a different experience . ''

Google has dumped Intel architecture in its new Google TV products in favour of the ARM-based Marvell Armada 1500 chipset . The new televisions will be showcased at CES 2012 next week , complete with the Marvell Armada 1500 HD Media System-on-a-chip which should mean lower prices and better power efficiency than the Intel-made predecessors . What 's more , the passive cooling system means no whirring fans to distract you from whatever it is you 're watching . `` The Google and Marvell teams have been working closely together to bring our combined software and chipset technologies to market to grow the Google TV ecosystem of manufacturers and devices , '' said Mario Queiroz , VP of product management at Google TV . `` Marvell-powered Google TV solutions will enable powerful products to be brought to market at attractive prices . '' Both LG and Samsung have talked up their interest in Google TV televisions and , although Samsung said it wo n't be able to show its TV set off at the show , we 're expecting to see more than one launching at CES 2012 next week . And of course TechRadar will be out in Vegas to bring you our expert thoughts on the new televisions as they launch – it 's a hard life , we know . From Marvell via SlashGear
Dan Belton is the consumer and retail director for Intel UK . His main responsibilities include engaging with the principal UK retailers and OEMs to bring consumer platforms and technologies to market . We asked him all about Ultrabooks . How excited is Intel about Ultrabooks ? The first thing I would say about Ultrabooks is that this is a really big deal for Intel . We see it as a big deal , as big as when we launched Centrino eight and a half years ago . This is a really exciting category that gives consumers the features and form factor that they love in laptops , but also delivers the features they are beginning to really enjoy with tablet PCs , such as instant-on . So the 'ultra ' part of it is n't just that it 's ultra-thin and ultra-cool looking , which it is . It 's about the ultra-capabilities that we 're going to be building into these systems - security features , battery power , instant-on and standby . It 's massively exciting for us ; we have big ambitions and we 're pleased to see how the OEMs are really getting behind the product . What is the philosophy behind the Ultrabook ? We 've always been at the forefront of creating categories and form factors . Our new Sandy Bridge products are delivering high performance for the consumer , but more importantly , they 're also delivering really fantastic visual capabilities for things such as photos , videos - even some gaming . In some cases our Sandy Bridge Core i5 and i7 products are running games as fast as a graphics card would . I think this is a response to what we see happening in the market , and we think that users are definitely still buying lots of laptops . We 're still seeing lots of growth in that , but the extension of use of computing is becoming so important , hence the need to have these more beautiful , slimmer designs . We also need that capability built into the systems that add this instant-on connection with the added security features you get with a laptop . This is definitely where people are moving in terms of the type of computing they 're doing . You 've said that the OEMS are really excited about Ultrabooks . How much interest has there been from the industry ? Yes , you may have seen launches from companies like Acer , Asus , Toshiba and Lenovo , and we expect the other big manufacturers to be coming on stream in the early part of next year as well . So there is a broad interest . You know , as much as anything else , this is good for the consumers , because they are getting very feature-rich products in a great form factor . But it 's good for the industry as well in terms of hitting that sweet price point of around £699 to £899 . This is something that the OEMs and the retailers have been looking how to do with new and exciting technologies . Ultrabooks are the thing that 's driving that for them , and you 've got a rich ecosystem behind it , around those people that are buying it , and some of the applications and services that we 'll see coming through with it as well . We know from what 's going on in the market that this is a really compelling proposition . You 've mentioned the sweet spot , price wise , of around £699 to £899 . At the moment prices for Ultrabooks are around £1,000 . There have been some concerns that this price is too high . The prices will come down . Actually , what 's happened is that some of the products are coming in with Core i5 and Core i7 at launch . So you 've seen Acer and Asus launch at around the price you 've described , but as the volume goes up , like any commercial model , going forward our expectation is that the prices will adjust themselves . The target price was always $ 1,000 , which turns out to be around £699 . How much market share is Intel hoping to get with the Ultrabook ? We have an aggressive target that 40 per cent of consumer laptops will be Ultrabooks this time next year . One of the Ultrabook 's biggest competitors is the MacBook Air . Why should people buy an Ultrabook over a MacBook Air ? This is a question that a lot of people have asked , and we ca n't deny that the MacBook Air is a very good product and Apple is a very good partner of Intel on those products . But there is the fact that there are people used to the Windows environment as well and this is what Ultrabooks are going to provide and it 's going to offer a broadening of brands that they 're used to buying within a form factor that they are looking for . So are you working closely with Microsoft then ? We always do . Our connection with Microsoft almost dates back to when we both started , and we have a very tight working relationship with the company . With Windows 8 launching , you 've mentioned that there are going to be touch capabilities in the future . Can you explain more about that ? We expect that as our technology develops around the new platforms for Ivy Bridge and so forth , we 'll absolutely see those sorts of capabilities become more involved and integrated with the product . I can tell you that 's within our roadmap , so whether that will be in the OEMs ' roadmaps as we go forward - we 'll learn that in the future . We certainly see touch as part of the proposition of the future . Has Intel issued a set of standards that products must meet to be called Ultrabooks ? We have . It 's things like what we call the ' Z ' height , which is the thickness . It also has technical capabilities within the platform as well , around SSD and various other bits . In late 2011 you 'll begin to see systems that offer thin and light designs that are less than 21mm thick , and some much thinner than that . System must also have ultra-fast startup . The PC should wake up almost instantly for quick access to your data and applications . They should also have a minimum of five hours ' battery life . So do you expect people to walk into a shop and ask for an Ultrabook instead of a laptop or a netbook ? Well , we 've just started [ laughs ] so you know ... Certainly the early signs are very encouraging . We 've only just gone on the shelves and the products , we believe , are starting to sell out , so that 's encouraging . We 'll certainly be putting a lot of effort into describing the benefits associated with Ultrabooks in the future , so that will incorporate full retail merchandising , above the line activities and social media with a view to positioning the Ultrabook as the product that people are really going to want to buy . I think that when they get it in their hands and use it , I think they will see that it the product people will want to buy in the future . Are you using one at the moment ? I 'm waiting for mine to come . I should be getting one fairly shortly , and I 'm going to be using it at home . In fact , I 'm buying my Ultrabook with my own money , I want one so badly ! What does the future hold for Intel and Ultrabooks ? The future looks fantastically bright . We 've got great products coming through , and the Ultrabook is absolutely one of those . We 've got a great understanding of the consumer journey . We 've got great channel models , and as far as we 're concerned we 're going to invest heavily in the value parts of the market and we 'll drive value for the consumer and for our partners , or retailers , for OEMs . That covers the future of consumer computers as well . The future 's very bright . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- First published in PC Plus Issue 316 Liked this ?

Intel has announced a major overhaul of its Medfield smartphone processor platform here at MWC 2012 , adding two new Atom chips to its line-up . The Atom Z series , which was unveiled at CES 2012 , previously only featured the Z2460 . That was a single-core chip based on the 32nm Penwell architecture famous for powering phones , tablets , low-cost PCs , netbooks and nettops . The silicon giant has now added two more chips to its line-up , the dual-core Atom Z2580 and a low-cost Z2000 , which is aimed at emerging markets . The Atom Z2580 features two cores that run at an improved 1.8GHz , but most importantly , has 4 hyperthreads , which act as virtual cores , enabling better performance when multitasking . While it 's not a quad-core processor , hyperthreading enables the processor to split its power effectively , designating one thread to any given task . Intel will hope that its hyperthreading capabilities can offset the gains made by Nvidia and ARM on the swathes of quad-core handsets that have been announced at this year 's Mobile World Congress , such as the HTC One X and the Huawei Ascend D1 , while delivering better battery life and power efficiencies . Those power savings chiefly come thanks to the 32nm architecture , which enables the chip to run more efficiently than rivals using larger dies . With ARM Cortex A9 , the chip at the heart of Tegra 3 , running at 40nm , Intel-based handsets has the ability to make real gains in battery life , and still deliver top notch performance for media and games . Aside from raw processing power , the Atom Z2580 has a dual-core graphics core clocked at 533MHz built into the Penwell SoC architecture , and 4G LTE . Medfield 's original single-core release raised questions about Intel 's ability to compete , and the likes of Nvidia have been keen to shout that more cores equal more power . However , benchmarks of the original Z2480 processor have shown that not to be the case . Medfield 's smart throttling of power , large dynamic range , and burst modes for intense work-loads revealed huge gains in terms of power efficiency and battery life . Intel will be hoping that their dual-core update can retain the efficiencies of the original Medfield chip , and compete with the likes of Tegra 3 in terms of processing power . The Z2580 has also been accompanied by a low-power Z2000 , which should bring the technology of the original Atom Z Series to the developing market . The Z2000 is essentially a hobbled version of the original Z2460 , featuring a single-core 1GHz Atom processor , supporting a 300MHz graphics core , 720p playback and up to 8MP rear facing camera . The sub- $ 200 market is a huge opportunity for Intel to make a serious play , in a space which is dominated by some pretty poor offerings . Most of the low-cost handsets by the likes of ZTE , Huawei and Lenovo use ARM 9 and ARM 11 chips , and the emergence of a 32nm Intel processor into this space could make a huge difference in terms of market share . Intel hopes to have its new Z2580 and Z2000 Atom chips into smartphones by mid-2012 .
Intel has confirmed that the delivery of its new Ivy Bridge processor which will power the next generation of Ultrabooks has been delayed . We had already heard rumblings that shipments of the new chip could be knocked back , but now it has been confirmed by Intel 's Sean Maloney . The Ivy Bridge chips were expected as early as April , but when asked for a new release date by the Financial Times , Maloney said , `` I think maybe it 's June now . '' Maloney suggested the delay was due to the upgraded manufacturing process used to produce the 22nm process chips ( compared to the 32nm process Sandy Bridge chips ) . The delay will have a knock-on effect on the production of the next generation of Ultrabooks which are set to rely upon Intel 's Ivy Bridge mobile processor to deliver longer battery life and faster speeds than its predecessor , Sandy Bridge .

Intel has combined a Wi-Fi transceiver with a dual-core Atom processor , opening up the possibility of slimmer mobile devices with longer battery life . The company plans to present its new chip , codenamed Rosepoint at ISSCC 2012 in San Francisco later this week . With fewer separate chips , mobile devices like phones , tablets and laptops could be slimmer , less battery-intensive and even cheaper . Radio components like Wi-Fi chips are especially difficult to miniaturise as they 're usually based upon complex analogue circuitry . Intel has managed to buck this trend by producing a digital Radio Frequency ( RF ) which can be shrunk as chip parts become smaller . Intel 's chief technology officer , Justin Rattner , says the chips will have `` state of the art power efficiency , '' and that `` with a digital approach to radio , you can bring the benefits of Moore 's law to RF and radio circuits . '' The Rosepoint design puts a digital 2.4GHz Wi-Fi chip right next to a dual-core Atom processor in a mobile system-on-a-chip design . There are difficulties in combining wireless radio and CPUs , however , as both can emit disruptive radiation . `` This radiation seeps into the RF module and corrupts the data , '' says Hossein Alavi , director of Intel 's Radio Integration Lab . `` The closer they are , the more interference is going to go to them . '' To get around this , Intel has developed noise-cancelling and radiation-shielding measures to apply to the chips . It even has chips with antennas included in the works . Currently the subject of a research project , the new chips could feature in mobile tech by 2015 . Via Wired

Our columnist Gary Marshall points out that Microsoft 's decision to prevent third-party apps on ARM-based Windows 8 desktops will only serve to confuse . He 's right . And , what 's more , it horribly hobbles ARM-based Windows 8 hardware to the extent that Intel will be rubbing its hands together with glee . Last September I suggested that ARM-based Windows 8 's lack of legacy app support was the elephant in the room for the OS . It still is . People wo n't understand they ca n't just download and install legacy apps on something that looks like a standard Windows 8 desktop . That 's not what Windows means to people . OK , so there will be Office 15 apps and other bits and pieces pre-installed , while we will have plenty of lovely third-party apps using the Metro interface . But the ARM Windows 8 desktop wo n't be a flexible experience . And that can only mean customers will turn away – indeed , I feel that this news means that manufacturers will play it safe and we 'll only see a few ARM-based Windows 8 tablets at the launch of Windows 8 , rather than the plethora of multipurpose devices I 'd hoped for . You see , people will expect Windows 8 devices to give them options . New possibilities . They wo n't want an iPad 3 alternative that has a bit of old Windows tacked on . We knew that x86-based devices would still dominate the Windows 8 landscape . But we had hoped that ARM-based Windows devices would take the OS beyond the traditional PC and give us some really exciting tablet-laptop hybrids that could be used for work or play . The single device to suit every occasion . I was looking forward to having an ARM-based Windows 8 convertible running a chip like the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 , where I could use Metro in tablet mode but also get the full laptop experience with a keyboard and the Windows desktop when needed . Now it seems that many of these more complex and interesting devices will end up being Intel-based , rather like the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga we loved so much at CES 2012 . IDEAPAD YOGA : We 'll be seeing a lot more Intel-based convertible Windows 8 devices And that 'll be because manufacturers know what will sell . To be frank , people are so used to looking for something with Intel inside . Intel made it clear at CES that touch-based Ultrabooks will be with us for Windows 8 , and many of these could be convertible devices using the Core series of processors . Intel is keen to make inroads into the tablet market and recently announced the Atom chip it hopes can compete with ARM in many phones and tablets . Despite the Atom 's relative lack of power and battery life compared to the best ARM silicon , it will be rather happy at the possibilities that Windows 8 can bring .

ARM believes that Intel 's attempts to crack the mobile phone market have served to highlight just how dominant the British company 's designs are in the post-PC world . One of the UK 's most successful companies , ARM-designed chips are in everything from digital cameras to the latest tablets , and yet the Cambridge-based technology firm is a long way from being a household name . Speaking to TechRadar , executive vice president Lance Howarth admitted that ARM needed to `` raise its game '' in terms of bringing the brand to the fore , but only if the balance is right for their huge network of partners . `` Three years ago I 'd say we suffered with anonymous ubiquity , '' said Howarth . `` We were everywhere , but nobody knew . `` Now we 're starting to see a transition because of mobile devices . The awareness of ARM and the types and diversity of the devices we are in is becoming talked about . `` The arrival of Windows 8 on ARM is accelerating that even further . `` So one of our challenges is getting this balance right , supporting our federation and partnership against the empire of Intel . It 's how we join up our efforts – so that the combined aggregate total is not just ARM against Intel , but Qualcomm TI NDS and so on ARM : `` One of the best things that 's ever happened to us is Intel trying to come into the smartphone space '' `` We 're all joined by a common set of values which is the people have united around the ARM architechture . `` My utopian goal is that when you guys talk about technology , say the latest HTC phone – that it is n't HTC on Qualcomm but HTC on Qualcomm which is ARM – I want to get ARM into almost every article . '' Intel has been a hugely dominant force in silicon chips for many years , especially in the realm of computers , with the x86 architecture the basis for almost every PC for years . With times changing , however , Intel is now looking to the mobile device market – something that Howard believes has brought unforeseen benefits . `` One of the best things that 's ever happened to us , quite frankly , is Intel trying to come into the smartphone space , '' he said . `` We 're a UK company and as a consequence we do n't normally fit into the US tech coverage , so when Intel come along and say 'we 're getting into smartphones ' all the Germans say 'hold on , we 've already got smartphones – and if you are n't in smartphones then who is ? ' `` So they say 'it 's Qualcomm and Nvidia and Ti and , oh they are using this technology from ARM ' , so suddenly your message is getting out there . ''

With the launch of Intel 's Ivy bridge processors just weeks away , I 'm expecting to fall under the deafening silence of Intel 's NDA hammer any day now . So , it 's time to sum up what you can expect from Intel 's latest PC processors before my hands are tied , lips sealed and the lawyers set to DEFCON 1 . Drawing together various leaks and official expositions form Intel , there are a few things that seem absolutely certain about the new Intel Ivy Bridge processors . Firstly , they 're a product of Intel 's shiny new 22nm process . And that means radical new 3-D tri-gate transistors live therein . The technicalities are pretty complex . But the overall upshot is said to be a major reduction in current leakage . In turn , that supposedly means the 22nm shrink is almost like a double-node step in terms of performance-per-watt . However , we also know that Intel is n't using this technological advance to provide higher clockspeeds . Intel is widely reported to be pegging the fastest Ivy Bridge launch chip , the Core i7 3770K , at the same 3.5GHz seen with the existing Core i7 3700K . OK , you might argue , Intel is keeping the clocks static . But if it adds more cores , we 're still winning . And you 'd be right , if Intel was adding any cores . But it is n't . The 3770K is still quad-core , just like the 2700K . What 's more , since Ivy Bridge is a Tick rather than a Tock in Intel 's Tick-Tock cadence thingy , those cores are largely an architectural carry over . Intel has said that some changes have been made to improve per-core performance . But the general consensus is that the improvement is not dramatic . All of which means the processor part of the Ivy Bridge equation almost definitely wo n't deliver the kind of performance improvement that you can actually feel . Making matters worse , it 's not looking like it will be any cheaper than existing and equivalent chips from the outgoing generation . What , then , is the point of Ivy Bridge and does it have anything to offer ? For Intel , it looks like a winner . Those smaller 22nm transistors are much smaller than the current 32nm sort , so Ivy Bridge chips will be cheaper to make . With prices staying the same , say hello to fatter margins and bigger profits . To be fair , you can also expect a big uptick in the performance of the integrated Intel HD Graphics and associated QuickSync video transcode processing - perhaps as much as a doubling of performance . It 's still unlikely to deliver the sort of 3D performance that any self-respecting gamer would tolerate , however . I 'm also hoping for a decent extra slug of overclocking headroom . I 'd have thought 5GHz on air for the unlocked K Seires Ivy Bridgers ought to be easily achievable . Some 32nm Sandy Bridge chips can manage that already . But overall , it very much looks like Ivy Bridge adds to an increasingly convincing case against Intel for foot dragging and sand bagging . Firstly , I 'm convinced Intel could easily be flogging 4.5GHz versions of Ivy Bridge . I also think it could maintain existing margins and profitability with a six-core version . The reason it is n't doing either of those things is that it is now operating without any competition nor any future prospect of competition . AMD 's new FX processors are no threat and AMD itself has publicly indicated that it no longer sees competing with Intel as a priority . The game is up and with it the prospect of rapid increases in PC processor performance . Oh well . It was fun while it lasted .

Intel is considering dipping its toe into the web TV market , with the chip manufacturer readying an IPTV set-top box which will offer premium television content through the internet . This is according to the Wall Street Journal , which has it on good authority that Intel is looking to provide the world with a rival to Apple TV – and has begun speaking to cable companies and media outlets in the US about offering content through Intel 's system . Although the negotiations taking place are said to be in their early stages , Intel certainly has the chip power to create a set top box of this magnitude , but it is the IPTV service which is the most interesting part of this rumour . Until recently the company was seen as the go-to chip maker for Smart TVs but with Samsung and others now choosing their own chips , it has lost its footing in this area and announced that it would no longer be pushing to get its x86 processor into sets . By branching out on its own and offering an IPTV service , it is looking to offer a service similar to Google TV – in which it played a key part – and Apple TV . The difference here being that it would allow media companies to host their full channels on the service , instead of going down the VoD route . The internet is set to be where the next big push for content will take place . Although cable in the US and satellite in the UK is dominant , the web is being readied for TV programming . You only have to look at Sky and its attempts to bring its content to customers without a dish to see where the industry is going . And it 's not as if Intel does n't have the calibre of people to create such a service – Erik Huggers left the BBC , where he was instrumental in getting the iPlayer off the ground , and joined Intel over a year ago . If anyone is able to create an Apple TV rival , then it would be him . Although Intel will be hoping that its service will become more than a hobby . Via Business Week

So Intel has finally entered the smartphone market . But will anyone buy Intel-based phones ? And should you even care ? What with all the fabulous new handsets and tablets that appeared at Mobile World Congress 2012 recently , it 's hard to get excited by what is ostensibly a pretty unremarkable second handset following up the Lenovo K800 we saw at CES 2012 . With just one CPU core and no single specification to really sex it up , the Intel Atom-powered Orange Santa Clara certainly looked like a tough sell next to the lush new handsets from Nokia , Sony , HTC and Samsung . More to the point , if you 're in the market for a new smartphone , why on earth would roll the dice on some weirdo handset powered by an unproven x86 processor ? As it happens , early benchmarks of the Intel Atom Medfield processor found inside the Orange Santa Clara show that that it 's not only a pretty quick customer , but also in the right ballpark when it comes to performance per watt . However , the reality is that Medfield is merely a proof of concept for Intel . Intel has yet to pull out the big guns . To understand why , you need to forget about cores , clockspeeds and the whole ARM vs x86 thing . If Intel gets anywhere in the smartphone business it will be thanks to process technology . That 's because smaller transistors and better manufacturing nodes make for faster , more efficient chips . Architectures will only get you so far . In fact , you could say that 's what Intel is really all about . In other words , the chip architectures are all very nice , but Intel 's real advantage is in chip manufacturing . Intel spends billions of dollars on the fabs that build its chips . Year after year , it develops and rolls out perhaps the most advanced chip manufacturing technology on the planet . It 's simply the best at this stuff . That 's in stark contrast to makers of the ARM chips who either pay someone else to knock out chips for them or treat chip manufacture as more of a bulk process than a fine art . Right now , Intel is tackling the transition from 32nm to 22nm . The first 22nm PC processors are due later this year . Currently , Intel is taking a pretty conservative approach to pushing its Atom chips onto new processes . Medfield is a 32nm processor . We wo n't see 22nm Atoms until next year . But thereafter , Intel says it will schedule Atom for the earliest possible transition to new architectures . So we 'll see both PC processors and phone chips on the 14nm process in 2014 . And it 's then that we 'll really know just how much damage Intel can do to the big boys in phone chips . If it stays on schedule and if its 14nm process delivers Intel traditional technology advantages , those 14nm phone chips could be killers . They should be the smallest , most efficient chips available . Not because they 're x86 . But because they 'll be manufactured on a superior silicon process . Whether this actually happens or not , however , is another matter . Medfield probably already has a small process advantage at 32nm over most smartphone chips . Most current ARM chips for phones are either 40nm or 45nm , with a few 32nm efforts just appearing . However , Intel recently announced a delay rolling out its first 22nm PC processors , so all is n't completely kosher with its 22nm node . Whether that will have any impact on 22nm Atoms next year and 14nm Atoms in 2014 is a pretty tough call . As for whether you should care about any of this , well , if Intel does pull it off , that means more competition . And more competition will translate into faster , cheaper and longer lasting phones . I think we can all agree , that 's a good thing .

Intel reckons that a new server needs to be deployed for every 120 tablets or 600 smartphones that hit the market . The chip giant has launched a new server chip , the Xeon E5-2600 with up to eight cores , but it was more interested in talking about it in terms of the sheer number of connected devices we 're connecting to the cloud every day . `` The role of data is changing dramatically , how it will evolve is becoming increasingly unpredictable , '' said Intel UK chief Graham Palmer . `` What is happening ? There 's an explosion of data , there 's an explosion of devices connecting to the internet . Our view is that in 2015 there will be 15 billion devices connecting to the internet in some way , with 3.1 billion individuals connected . '' `` Our own assessment is that as these devices grow , for 600 smartphones or every 120 tablets , that requires another server to be deployed . There 's a direct correlation between the number of devices and the deployment of servers to support them . '' `` Those 15 billion devices are setting a key challenge for those tasked with architecting these [ systems ] . `` Before , IT [ departments ] were the unsung hero , running our businesses . Today it 's very different because the innovation…is the entire foundation of the new services those businesses can offer . This is creating a much more forward-thinking role for IT staff . `` We 're seeing a 20 times increase in demand for compute performance and 10 times for storage [ capacity ] . '' Intel claims the new chip has a potential performance improvement of 80 per cent over the previous generation . The corporation also reckons it has twice the design wins ready to go for the new chip compared to the Nehalem-based Xeon 5500 from 2009 . There 's also an enhanced version of Turbo Boost that can redirect power from an idle core to an active one , meaning it can better handle workload spikes – power needs are reassessed every 10ms .

Is it time to give up on traditional CPU performance and embrace alternative methods ? That 's what I 've been pondering of late thanks to Intel QuickSync video feature , reprised in its latest Ivy Bridge processors , the Intel Core i5-3750K and the Intel Core i7-3770K . QuickSync , of course , is far from new . It 's in Intel 's previous Sandy Bridge generation of CPUs and therefore it 's been around for over a year . But in raw performance terms , it was still the most impressive single feature in the new Ivy Bridge processors . In part that 's because Ivy Bridge brings very little extra in terms of plain old CPU performance , something that I see becoming more and more of a trend as Intel switches its focus to mobile and ultramobile computing . But there 's more to it than that . For my testing , I transcoded an hour-long full-HD episode of a certain swords and just-a-little sorcery that 's proving popular at the moment . Using the four CPU cores in the 3770K , which is the fastest of the new Ivy Bridge chips , the task takes around 10 to 15 minutes depending on setting . Not bad and probably four or five times faster than you might expect from a typical PC with a dual core chip with a couple of years under its belt . However , flick the switch on QuickSync and accelerate the work in hardware and the time tumbles to just a few minutes . In other words , it 's become quick enough to do as a last moment thing before you pop out the door . Fancy catching up on your favourite show in the train that day ? No real planning required . If you remember that you wanted to do it at all , you 've probably got time thanks to QuickSync . Of course , there are a few provisos . Intel does make more powerful PC processors than the 3770K . The Intel Core i7-3960X , for instance , has six cores and will give you around 30 per cent better performance in CPU-encoding mode . But that 's still miles off the performance of the 3770K using QuickSync . And the 3960X is based on a server-derived architecture and completely lacks the QuickSync feature . It 's also intriguing to note that QuickSync performance holds up pretty well in lower spec Intel processors . I 've a pretty weedy Ultrabook knocking about that will transcode video at about half the pace of the 3770K in QuickSync mode . That means it 's faster than that 3960X as it brute forces the job in its six cores . The marketing suits at AMD and Nvidia would of course argue that they 've been offering similar capabilities via their discrete graphics chips for yonks . Which is true . But not everyone has discrete graphics . Integrated graphics is where the market is at for the most part . Moreover , it wo n't be too long before the vast majority of client and consumer PCs have QuickSync capability in some form or vintage . No the real problem with QuickSync is software support . It 's gotten better since the disappointing pair of applications available at launch a year or so ago ( here 's a list of the most popular QuickSync applications . But QuickSync will only be really effective fro most people when compatibility is virtually 100 per cent , when the whole thing is almost invisible to end users . It just works , no need to click boxes or check settings . In the meantime , it 's an absolutely killer feature for those in the know .

The NDA has lifted and the lawyers are back in their cages . It 's time to talk Ivy Bridge . I speak , of course , of Intel 's latest PC processor family , hot from the fabs in all its 22nm glory . You can read full reviews of the first Intel Intel Core i5 3570K and Intel Intel Core i7 3770K iterations of Ivy Bridge here on TechRadar . But what to make of the new processor family as a whole ? Prior to launch , my hopes were n't high . All the indications were that Intel was n't adding cores or clockspeeds . It was also known that Ivy Bridge was a Tick rather than a Tock in Intel 's Tick-Tock parlance - and that means a die shrink rather than an all-new architecture . Weirdly , however , Intel 's also pitching Ivy Bridge as the Third Generation Core architecture . The previous two generations were the families known as Nehalem and Sandy Bridge , which were radically new designs that delivered huge performance boosts . Not exactly two terribly complimentary sets of expectations . That said , I was hopeful regarding at least one aspect . Intel 's new 22nm production process was n't just any old die shrink . Intel is also introducing its 3D Tri-gate transistors which promise to do everything from reducing power consumption to increasing clocks . The graphics part of the Ivy Bridge package also looked promising thanks to more execuation units and an upgrade to DirectX 11 support . As it turns out , Ivy Bridge is the most disappointing new chip from Intel in recent memory . Well , so long as you discount the Atom line of ultra mobile processors which operate in a very different market . As predicted , Ivy Bridge is a case on no more cores . Four is your lot . Given that a lot of software still does n't scale that well across multiple CPU cores , that 's not actually that big a deal . It 's been clear for a while now that the future of PC processing probably does n't involve an inexorable rise in the core count . Instead , more per-core performance is also needed . Unfortunately , Ivy Bridge does n't deliver . For the most part , clockspeeds compared to the outgoing Sandy Bridge generations of Core i5 and Core i7 processors have remained static . And with relatively few changes to the design of the cores – and no extra cache memory – instructions per clock are only very marginally up . All that I pretty much expected . What I was n't ready for was a similar status quo in terms of overclocking . You can argue that overclocking is an irrelevant niche activity . And you 'd have a point . On the other hand , PC processors have long been powerful enough for the needs of the average punter . So , if you 're reading this and have interest in PC performance , overclocking should be on your radar . Unfortunately , however , Ivy Bridge wo n't provide much of a blip on your screen . In my testing , I actually beat it with the old Sandy Bridge sample I acquired a year ago to the tune of 5.1GHz beats 4.9GHz . Not a big margin and 4.9GHz is still a nice result . But it does n't exactly back up Intel 's hype for its new 22nm process . Likewise , a drop in peak power consumption from 120W to 115W is n't exactly exotic . Oh and as for that new integrated graphics core , it 's a goodly chunk faster than the old . But it 's still pretty crap for games . To be absolutely clear , Ivy Bridge is not a bad processor family . In fact , it 's the best mainstream PC processor you can buy . But it 's not nearly as good as it could have been . Instead , it 's carefully positioned to be merely as good as it needs to be . The reason Intel can get away with this , of course , is the failure of its only rival in this market , AMD , to even turn up to the fight for the last three or four years . But that 's a story for another time .

Intel 's new Ivy Bridge processors are out . You can read full reviews of the Intel Core i5-3750K and Intel Core i7-3770K , the first two models in this brave new 22nm generation , on TechRadar . Problem is , those are just two among a 15-strong launch line up that includes both desktop and mobile processors . Then there 's Intel 's baffling branding scheme , which makes about as much sense as an edition of Chaucer machine-translated into Swahili . But have no fear , TechRadar is here to unpick the intricacies of Intel 's latest CPU family . First the good news . On the desktop side , the new Ivy Bridge processors slot straight into the existing Intel LGA1155 CPU socket and therefore any motherboard thus equipped . Most motherboards will require a BIOS upgrade for compatibility . But that 's fairly straight forward these days . Simply check your board manufacturer 's website for an update and instructions . As for laptops , socket spec is pretty inconsequential since home-brew upgrades are really on the menu . Also making things a little simpler on the desktop side is the fact that the new Ivy Bridge models also fit into pretty much the same categories as the outgoing Sandy Bridge generation of Core i5 and Core i7 processors . From the top , we have the aforementioned Intel Core i7-3770K . It 's a quad-core CPU with HyperThreading running at a base speed of 3.5GHz and a top Turbo speed of 3.9GHz . It also has 8MB of cache memory and a fully unlocked CPU multiplier for easy overclocking . If that sounds familiar it 's because it 's absolutely identical to the chip it replaces , the Intel Core i7-2700K . Then again , prices of the new Ivy Bridge processors are pretty much in line with the older Sandy Bridge processors , so any progress could be classed as a freebie . And there are some dramatic differences . For starters , Ivy Bridge chips are built using Intel 's new 22nm production process . Smaller transistors usually make for lower power consumption and better performance . Intel says this is especially true of this latest 22nm node thanks to what is known as 3D Tri-gate transistors . The details are pretty techy , but the upshot is said to be better current flow and control . The other big news is a majorly revised integrated graphics core . As we 'll see , it comes in two versions and the most powerful , the Intel HD Graphics 4000 , gets an extra four execution units for a grand total of 16 . The entry level HD 2500 sticks with six units . However , both get a heavily revised architecture with support for Microsoft 's DirectX 11 API . That should ensure wider compatibility with games . However , even the more powerful HD 4000 model is n't really up to the job of proper gaming on the desktop . Even a cheap £50 graphics card will be much more effective . Things are a little different in laptops , but we 'll come back to that in a moment . Of more immediate relevance is the revised QuickSync video transcode engine that comes with both models of the HD Graphics adapters . The idea here is hardware acceleration of jobs like transcoding your favourite videos for use on a smartphone for instance . With QuickSync , preparing a full hour-long TV episode takes just a few minutes . Using a conventional CPU takes at least four or five times as long . If that 's the broader back ground to Ivy Bridge , this is how the range lines up . The aforementioned Core i7-3770K gets the HD graphics 4000 and goes for about £265 . Closely related is the Intel Core i7-3770 which is identical save for 100MHz base clockspeed at 3.4GHz ( Turbo remains 3.9GHz ) and a locked multiplier , yours for roughly £240 . Then there 's the Intel Core i5-3750K . It 's still a quad-core model , but does n't get HyperThreading so can crunch just one software thread per core instead of two . It also has the HD Graphics 4000 and that unlocked multiplier but is down on cache with 6MB . £170 should be enough for proud ownership of the 3750K . It 's our choice if you 're a gamer – the extra threads of the Core i7s do n't help in games . Next up is the Intel Core i5-3550 . Here we 're talking four cores , no HyperThreading , 6MB cache , HD Graphics 2500 , 3.3GHz / 3.7GHz clocks and pricing around £150 . The Intel Core i5-3450 reduces things to 3.1GHz / 3.5GHz and will save you roughly £15 to £20 . That 's pretty much it for the mainstream desktop variety . There 's a quartet of specialist low-power models with lower clockspeeds , but they 're not terribly interesting on the desktop . As our reviews have revealed , the first desktop Ivy Bridge chips have n't exactly blown us away with their raw performance – it 's little changed from the Sandy Bridge generation . However , things look a lot more promising for notebooks . We 've yet to sample an Ivy Bridge-powered portable , but the specs look great . All the launch models are quad core , support HyperThreading and pack the HD Graphics 4000 . The top chip is the Core i7-3920QM , which sports 8MB of cache and clocks in at 2.9GHz base and an astonishing 3.8GHz Turbo , making in nearly as quick as the best desktop variant . For the record , the old Intel Core i7-2960XM from the Sandy Bridge generation was a 2.7GHz / 3.7GHz chip . Feeding on down the range , we have the Intel Core i7-3820QM with 2.7GHz / 3.7GHz clocks and the Intel Core i7-3720QM at 2.6GHz / 3.6GHz and 6MB cache . Then there 's the 2.3GHz / 3.3GHz Intel Core i7-3615QM , the 3610QM which is identical save for a slightly slower graphics clockspeed and the 3612QM which is a low power model running 2.1GHz / 3.1GHz clocks . As for which one to go for , we reckon they 'll all be pretty similar in use with the exception of the 3612QM , which is the best bet for maximising battery life . And that 's something we 're expecting to see improve dramatically with Ivy Bridge thanks to those 22nm transistors . What you may have noticed is that none of these first Ivy Bridge mobile processors are designed for ultra-mobile and therefore Ultrabooks , with the lowest power model weighing in at 35W for power consumption . Intel tells us we 'll have to wait until June for an announcement involving Ivy Bridge chips for Ultrabooks . That said , you can expect Apple to update their MacBook portables with the new chips pretty soon . Spotting them could be tricky thanks to Apple 's unique processor branding , but the best guide will be clockspeeds . Keep in touch with TechRadar as we update with the latest Ivy Bridge-based portables !
Today sees the launch of Intel 's latest line of quad-core desktop processors , code-named Ivy Bridge . They will collectively be known as the 3rd Generation of Intel Core Microarchitecture . Though we 've got to say calling the new Core i7 3770K and Core i5 3570K 3rd Gen seems a little disingenuous if you ask us . Going by the traditional Intel Tick-Tock iteration process this is purely a production process shrink of its last architecture . That was the 32nm Sandy Bridge , it of the i5 2500K fame , and this then is purely a shrink down to use Intel 's new 22nm Tri-Gate transistor tech . Though Intel is claiming the serious upgrade it has done to the processor graphics in Ivy Bridge makes it more of a Tick plus , and therefore deserves the 3rd Gen moniker . Despite the production process shrinkage , we are getting no extra clockspeed and no more cores over and above the quad-core chips we had in the last generation of Intel CPUs . None of which is to say these are bad chips , oh no , these are the best CPUs on the market right now . Well , the best real-world CPUs anyway . There is , of course , the hexcore behemoth of the Core i7 3960X and the crazy eight-core Xeon E5-2687W which you can just about class as desktop chips , but they 're far beyond the wallets of us mere mortals . We 've had the whole new setup - new chips , new chipsets and whole new machines – in our labs for a while now and we 've gone to town on them . Intel Ivy Bridge Intel 3rd Generation Core Microarchitecture Intel Core i7 3770K review Intel Core i5 3570K review Gigabyte Z77X-UD5H review Palicomp Alpha Detonator review While we are definitely impressed with what they can do , they do n't really represent much of an improvement over the last generation . In that Intel has been spoiling us with its last few breakthrough generations of chips . What we can say though is that even if really do n't need to upgrade from an existing Sandy Bridge chip , the Z77 chipset will get the most from your current hardware . We stuck an ageing Core i5 2600K in Asus ' Sabertooth Z77 and it happily clocked up , stably , to over 5.1GHz . The Core i7 3770K could only manage a still impressive 4.8GHz . The other sad thing is the chips wont be on sale for another few days , with April 28 looking a likely time for them to be released into the channel .
Intel does n't make desktop processors and has n't done for years . It makes mobile CPUs . And it makes server chips . But that 's it . This , people of TechRadar , is the gospel truth . Of course , Intel certainly markets a full range of processors for desktop PCs , but every last one of them started out as something else . Mainstream favourites like the Core i5 2500K are high end laptop chips tweaked for the desktop . High end beasts , including the new Core i7 3960X , are thinly disguised server CPUs . That 's important because it makes Intel 's latest family of CPUs , like the Intel Core i7 3770K and Core i5 3570K , much easier to understand . It explains why the new Ivy Bridge generation in desktop trim is getting little to nothing by way of added cores or clocks . It even just about justifies Intel 's claim that Ivy Bridge constitutes the third generation of its Core processor line , despite the fact that it 's a die shrink and not an all new architecture . But let 's not get ahead of ourselves . First , let 's tour the highlights of Intel 's latest CPU family . In Intel 's Tick-Tock parlance , Ivy Bridge is a Tick and that means a new process . In simple terms , it 's the 22nm follow up to Intel 's searingly successful 32nm Sandy Bridge processors , which launched a little over a year ago . According to Intel , it 's a little more complicated than that . For starters , Intel reckons the shift from 32nm to 22nm is something a bit special . Typical die shrinks involve making things smaller . When that happens , you usually get processors with more transistors , better power efficiency and higher clocks , but the most of the basic principles remain largely the same . Not so for the new 22nm process , says Intel . The big change is the introduction of what it calls 3D Tri-gate transistors . The details are mind bogglingly complex , but the simple version goes something like this : in conventional transistors , the gate oxide and inversion layers which essentially channel and control electrical current are flat and planar with relatively low surface area . In 3D Tri-gate transistors , it 's as if the gate oxide and inversion layer has been flipped up on its side and joined by two chums . That means much great surface area and in turn brings a load of benefits . Firstly , you get more control over current and thus much lower leakage . Less leakage means less power consumption and less heat which is just bonza for laptop CPUs . Alternatively , it also allows for greater current flow , which makes higher clockspeeds possible . Think desktop chips . In short , 3D Trigate-gate transistors are better at everything that matters . In the desktop context , what we 've got is a new process that ought to allow for more features , be they cores or something else , and higher clocks . The other half of the equation is the architecture . As above , Ivy Bridge is not all new . On the CPU side , not a lot has changed . The execution engines are carried over with only very small tweaks to the FP/integer divider , which has twice the throughput compared with Sandy Bridge , and a couple of other upgrades that involve data structure sharing and better handling of MOV operations . If that does n't mean much to you , do n't worry , the proof is in the performance , the details are relatively academic . Elsewhere on the CPU side , Intel has upped Ivy Bridge 's security ante with a hardware random number generator , which is handy for encryption , and a hardware-enabled supervisory mode that helps prevent malicious code from being executed . But this is the kind of stuff businesses will hook into rather than anything home users will automatically benefit from . Finally , Intel has revised Ivy Bridge 's overclocking set up . The basics are the same , so overclocking is effectively something that can only be done via the multiplier and that means only fully unlock K series models are pukka overclocking candidates . But the absolute multiplier limit for K series chips has been increased from 57 to 63 , something that 's really only of interest to extreme enthusiasts . More relevant is the addition of real-time multiplier tweaking from inside Windows . If nothing else , it will help cut out all that tedious rebooting . What Intel has n't done , however , is add any more cores . We 'll come to the detail momentarily , but the top Ivy Bridge model , like the Intel Core i7 3770K , sticks with four cores , just like existing 2nd Gen mainstream Core i7 chips for the LGA1155 socket . Still , at least the good news is that we 're still talking about LGA1155 chips . BIOS updates permitting , they theoretically drop into any 6 Series motherboard , including those based on the H67 , P67 and Z68 chipsets . It works the other way , too . Ye olde Sandy Bridge processors jive just fine with the new 7 Series boards , including the awesome new Z77 covered recently like the MSI Z77A-GD65 , and the excellent Asus Sabertooth Z77 and RoG Maximus V Gene motherboards . If that 's the traditional CPU side covered , it 's the graphics part of the equation where things get really interesting . Well , relatively speaking . As before , a full function graphics core is integrated on-die . As before , it comes in two version . And again as before , the entry-level model , now known as HD graphics 2500 , has six execution . But the top HD 4000 model now has 16 instead of 12 . That 's not all . Intel says each of those units are more powerful than before and now supports DirectX 11 , including tessellation . That 's enough , Intel says , to see the six-unit HD 2500 out perform the old six-unit HD 2000 by 10 to 20 per cent . Along with quicker 3D rendering , Intel has given the broader graphics package a polish . The QuickSync video transcode gets a once over for better performance , for instance . Native support for up to three displays is another first . That , pretty much , is your lot . Which begs the question of whether Ivy Bridge deserves its status as the `` 3rd Generation '' of Intel 's Core processors . Intel says it 's justified by the major graphics overhaul , but we think it 's a pretty odd thing to claim . It certainly adds to expectations . As you 'll see when you peruse the benchmarks , that may not have been wise . If that 's the broader architectural low down , what about the processor models themselves ? Here again , there 's a lot of similarity with the existing Sandy Bridge generation . Once again we have Core i5 and i7 chips and as before it 's the i5s and i7s you 'll be interested in . Similarly , the i5s get four threads from four cores and the i7s four eight threads from four cores thanks to Hyperthreading . At launch , there are nine new models to choose from . Putting the specialist low-power chips to one side , there are five you need to know about . The fun starts with the Core i5-3450 , with four cores , 6MB of cache , HD 2500 graphics , a base frequency of 3.1GHz and a top Turbo of 3.5GHz . Next up is the Core i5-3550 , which ups the clocks to 3.3GHz and 3.7GHz but is otherwise identical . The Core i5 3570K takes things to 3.4Ghz and 3.8GHz but also adds HD Graphics 4000 and of course that fully unlocked and overclock-friendly multiplier . Then there 's a pair of i7 models . The i7 3770 hits 3.4GHz and 3.9GHz with 8MB and Hyperthreading . The Intel Core i7 3770K ups the base clock to 3.5GHz and adds the unlocked multiplier . Cross reference the new chips with the old Sandy Bridge processors and you 'll see the clockspeeds have n't budged . That 's a big disappointment given the hype surrounding Intel 's 22nm process and the fact that once again we 're not getting extra cores . Any increase in performance will need to be architectural . And that 's a big ask for what is , on the CPU side at least , largely a die shrink . Ivy Bridge may be a bit late ( it was due out at the beginning of the year ) , but it 's still miles better than anything AMD can currently offer . Is there hope for tougher competition from AMD any time soon ? In a word , no . For starters , AMD recently said it no longer sees the fight with Intel for PC dominance as relevant . Instead , it sees mobile computing as the future . That , frankly , is a little disingenuous . Sure , mobile is where the growth is for the computing industry at large , but AMD would dearly love for its Bulldozer FX processors to be taking the fight to Intel . As it is , Bulldozer turned out to be another dud . AMD needs something dramatically different . And it 's not coming any time soon . Next up is Piledriver , due later this year if AMD hits its targets , which it usually does n't . Architecturally , Piledriver is no big shakes . But there is one feature that might just make things interesting . Known as resonant clock mesh , the idea is to use capacitance to capture clock power and recycle it , reducing power consumption by as much as 10 per cent . According to Cyclos Semiconductor , the oufit responsible for the new tech , it can also be used to push clockspeeds beyond 4GHz . Of course , the top Bulldozer chip already exceeds 4GHz in Turbo mode . So it 'll have to be well , well in excess of 4GHz . In truth , Piledriver needs to hit 5GHz to really put a bat up Intel 's nighty . Can you see that happening ? We ca n't .

Intel 's x86 processor architecture is coming soon to a smartphone near you . Or at least that 's what Intel wants to happen . But should you care ? x86 , of course , is shorthand for Intel 's proprietary CPU instruction set . It 's been around since the late 70s and it 's come to completely dominate desktop PCs and laptops . Even Apple realised resistance to x86 was futile and switched its desktop Macs and portable MacBooks from IBM 's PowerPC architecture to x86 in 2006 . At that stage , x86 looked set to take over all aspects of computing . But beavering away in the background was a relatively puny British outfit known as ARM . Its CPU architectures were optimised for low power and confined spaces – just perfect for smartphones , in other words . Intel 's x86 chips , by contrast , were more powerful than anything from ARM . But more powerful means more power hungry . Until relatively recently , Intel had nothing that even came close to the tiny power envelope demanded by smartphones . In 2008 , it wheeled out the first Atom chips , a new kind of x86 designed to be massively more power efficient than any previous x86 processor . The real battle for smartphone supremacy started there . Fast forward to 2012 and Intel has finally taken the wraps off the first x86 smartphones , powered by the Medfield revision of Atom . In the UK , your first chance to put x86 into your pocket is likely to be the Orange Santa Clara . Lenovo ( with the Lenovo K800 ) and Motorola have also announced x86-powered models . The first indication that it 's not going to be easy for Intel is that it 's taken a couple of years longer than originally indicated to get Atom chips into smartphones . What 's more , Intel is keeping claims regarding performance pretty modest . The gist is that it 's competitive on performance and battery life compared with existing ARM processors . Early benchmarks of Intel 's reference smartphone platform suggest Medfield is indeed quicker than the likes the iPhone 4S and Samsung Galaxy S II despite the fact that it 's currently a single-core processor . The problem for Intel is that those handsets sport relatively old dual-core ARM CPUs . By the time x86 smartphones are actually on the market later this year , much more powerful ARM chips , like Qualcomm 's Snapdragon S4 Krait , the next chip in the popular Snapdragon series , will be available and will no doubt stand tall over dual-core Atom . Krait looks to be at least about as quick in dual-core format and will also appear in quad-core format . Meanwhile several other quad-core ARM chips have popped up , including Nvidia 's Tegra 3 - check out our HTC One X review . Intel has promised a dual-core follow up to Medfield , but given its tardiness in delivering the first single-core variant , we 're not holding our breath . Of course , that 's just the hardware part of the equation . The software side is really important , too . . The good news is that the popular Android operating system has already been ported to x86 . The bad news is that existing Android apps may not be compatible with an Intel phone . Intel reckons 75 per cent of existing Android apps will run just fine . The problem is the remaining 25 per cent . The more demanding the app , the more likely it wo n't work . Anything with intensive graphics , including most games , are probably non-starters . It 's not that big a job to recompile such apps . But in the meantime , the plan is to software translation to allow as many apps as possible to run . Intel says the aim is roughly 90 per cent compatibility . How many and how well apps run could make or break x86 as a smartphone processor . The other problem for Intel is that graphics performance is increasingly key in the ultramobile segment . When Apple recently upgraded the new iPad , it left the CPU cores alone . Instead , it doubled graphics performance . A similar trend can be seen in smartphones , with graphics performance becoming ever more critical as screen resolutions increase , graphics become more complex and games more sophisticated . But if there 's anything Intel is n't good at , it 's graphics . In fact , Intel buys in the graphics design for the Medfield Atom processor . Unless Intel can come up with something special in-house ( and there 's no indication it 's even trying ) , it wo n't be able to offer better graphics designs than other smartphone processors . If that does n't sound terribly optimistic , there is one reason to think Intel might just be able to put a supercharged smartphone in your pocket . The thing that Intel does better than anyone else is manufacture computer chips . It has the most advanced production processes and creates the smallest transistors . Right now , it is n't making Atom processors on its most advanced 22nm process . But when the next die shrink to 14nm kicks in sometime in early 2014 , Intel says Atoms will be among the first to benefit . If that happens , Intel might be able to squeeze in more CPU and graphics cores , crank up the clockspeeds , extend battery life beyond the competition or allow for slimmer smartphones than ever before . It 's a big if , admittedly . But give it a couple of years and the fastest smartphones with the longest battery life and slimmest form factors might just be Intel inside .

Intel has revealed details on its upcoming Windows 8 tablets , which will target several areas of the market . Unveiled at a conference in Beijing , Intel say its Windows 8 tablets will pack a dual-core Atom Z2760 `` Clover Trail '' chip , which features a `` burst-mode '' , providing an extra boost of power when required . The Clover Trail processor also boasts hyperthreading technology , allowing it to act like a quad-core chip as certain times . Intel is planning on releasing a 10-inch Windows 8 tablet , which we expect to rival the new iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 , but it will also launch an 11-inch hybrid sporting a physical keyboard to challenge the likes of the Asus Transformer Prime . The famous chip maker is claiming its Windows 8 tablets will deliver over nine hours of battery , 4G connectivity , NFC technology , weigh less than 680g ( 1.5 pounds ) and sport a slender , sub-9mm body . We could well see these tablets arrive before the end of the year , if Microsoft makes Windows 8 commercially available in the second half of 2012 - and if these specs are anything to go by , we 're looking forward to getting our hands on them . Do you reckon Intel will be able to deliver a decent range of Windows 8 tablets , or will it fail to hit the mark ? Let us know in the comment box below . From CNET

Intel will see its processor house in 1 in 10 mobile devices by 2015 , as it slowly claws into ARM 's market . Intel is the new kid on the block when it comes to mobile processors , with British firm ARM Holdings all but dominating the market at the current time . However Intel is determined to produce mobile processors which are so good that Apple wo n't be able to resist using them in its iPhone and iPad ranges . According to ARM CEO Warren East , Intel will break into the market and predicts a healthy growth for its rival . Speaking to Dow Jones , East reckoned Intel would claim 5 % to 10 % of the smartphone market by 2015 – which would be an impressive gain in just two and half years . The Santa Clara-based firm is expected to launch itself into the mobile devices market later this year , with a range of smartphone and tablet offerings , including the Android-based Lenovo K800 handset . Intel certainly has a big job on its hands convincing manufactures to switch to its chips , but its pedigree in the PC and laptop sectors could well help drive it forward .

A published report claims that the first range of Windows 8 tablets will hit store shelves in November . The tablets will come in at least a dozen varieties , claims the source , with more than half of those being hybrids or convertibles that combine elements of laptops and tablets , often including physical keyboards . But all the Windows 8 tablets will have two things in common : they 'll run on a version of Microsoft 's Windows 8 operating system , and they 'll be powered by Intel 's upcoming Clover Trail dual-core processor . If this Windows 8 tablet rumor proves accurate then Windows 8 will be released either before or alongside the new devices in November . That time frame is in line with current rumors regarding Windows 8 's release , which state that Microsoft 's new OS will be released commercially in the second half of this year . `` The schedule is tight , '' said CNET 's source . We got a peek at Windows 8 released in March , and TechRadar deemed it an improvement over the previous Developer Preview but there 's still work to be done on the OS . Previous reports point to the many features Intel 's new line of Windows 8 tablets will pack , including 4G , NFC technology , lightweight designs and great battery life . Other rumors claim that Microsoft will release as many as 30 Windows 8 tablets by the end of the year in an attempt to whittle down the iPad 's lion 's share of the tablet market . The Windows 8 tablets will be powered by Intel 's upcoming Clover Trail Atom chip , their first dual-core Atom processor based on 32-nanometer technology . Additionally , Intel 's follow-up to the Clover Trail will be called `` Bay Trail '' and will be built on superior 22-nanometer tech , according to the published report . Intel confirmed to TechRadar in an email that Bay Trail is indeed the successor to Clover Trail and is slated to arrive in 2013 . TechRadar approached Microsoft about rolling out new Windows 8 Tablets , but a spokesperson declined to comment on the rumors . Via CNET
Intel CEO Paul Otellini says the company is hell-bent on creating new mobile processors , so good that Apple will not be able to resist putting them in the iPhone and iPad . The chip maker will make its first forays into the smartphone and tablet world this year with devices like the Lenovo K800 and others from Motorola that will run a mobile version of the Atom chip . Next stop , says Otellini , is convincing the big guns to jump on board , which means making better , more efficient processors than ARM , Samsung , Qualcomm and the rest . `` Our job is to ensure our silicon is so compelling , in terms off running the Mac better or being a better iPad device , that as they make those decisions they ca n't ignore us , '' he told Forbes . Although Intel has been planning a mobile assault for years , the charge is driven partly through rival manufacturer ARM 's decision to move in the other direction . Intel will , for the first time in years , face competition in the PC sector , where the i-Series processors boast almost complete dominance . However , the first Windows tablets to arrive toting ARM processors , will arrive this year and Microsoft has developed a specific version of Windows 8 - Windows RT for that eventuality . Although their are fears that ARM may seek to encroach further on to Intel 's turf , Otellini is confident his company can also put a dent in the mobile world . `` A year ago there was no one who was not an Intel employee who thought Intel stood a chance in this business , '' he added : `` And now you 're asking what our market share goals are . '' Unquestionably there would be no bigger goal to achieve than taking up residence in the iPhone or iPad . Via : Forbes

Intel announced that is introducing an entry-level Ivy Bridge Core i3 chip starting June 24 . Back in April Intel launched its third generation of processors known as Ivy Bridge . Ivy Bridge chips shrunk Intel 's existing i5 and i7 high-performance chips from a 32nm production process to a new 22nm chip using Tri-Gate transistor tech . The result is a more efficient processor , providing great performance while consuming less power , and at a lower price . However , at the time Intel did n't upgrade its entry-level notebook processor , the i3 chip , to Ivy Bridge . That is exactly what Intel plans to fix , announcing that Ivy Bridge Core i3 chips will be available in late June . Intel was previously thought to have the Ivy Bridge Core i3 chips ready in time for the holidays , so a late June release is quite ahead of schedule . There 's a very good reason for the timing bump , or at least we can speculate one : This should put the first line of entry-level Ivy Bridge i3 notebooks on store shelves in time for back to school sales . An affordable baseline notebook with new chips sounds like just the thing for students as they trudge back to classes in the fall , so expect some new hardware to start popping up making quick use of Ivy Bridge Core i3 .
In a move that can only be good for consumers , Intel is apparently putting pressure on Ultrabook component suppliers to minimise the costs of super-slim laptop production . With Apple lowering the cost of its new Sandy Bridge-powered MacBook Air line-up by $ 100 at WWDC , Intel is keen to maintain the cost advantage of Windows-based machines , says Digitimes . The company already has a plan in place to lower the base prices of Ultrabooks to $ 699 ( £450 ) in the second half of this year . However , Intel will reportedly meet with suppliers in Taiwan to discuss ways to make this happen sooner rather than later . The Digitimes report claims : `` Intel will focus on solutions to reduce component costs , including adoption of fiberglass-reinforced plastic cases in place of expensive aluminum-alloy , 16650 cylinder-shaped batteries or prismatic lithium-ion batteries in place of Li-polymer batteries and hybrid-HDDs in place of SSDs , the sources said . '' While this may see the price of Ultrabooks fall to a more affordable mark , we 've gotten used to the high-end feel of some devices like the ASUS UX31 . Surely replacing those cases with fiberglass-reinforced plastic would allow Apple to maintain its firm grip on the premium end of the market ? As well as the price cut , the chip manufacturer is looking to reach sales targets of 20-30m units this year , driven by manufacturers like Acer , Asus , Samsung , Toshiba and LG . Via : Digitimes

Intel looks like it agrees with Nokia and Microsoft when it comes to dual-core mobile phones , claiming that single cores do the job for now . Nokia 's CEO Stephen Elop has already made his view clear , stating back in April : `` The so-called dual-core , quad-core mobile phones can only waste batteries , but not be useful for consumers all the time . '' Now Intel has chimed in on the debate . Speaking to members of the press at an event in London , with TechRadar in attendance , Mike Bell , Vice President Intel Architecture Group said : `` As we move to multiple cores over time , we 're actually putting a lot of investment into the software to fix the scheduler and the threading , so if we do multiple core products [ in the future ] it actually takes advantage of it . `` In the meantime , we get enough performance out of our single core that we actually do n't need to turn on a second core . '' As well as being happy with the performance of its first mobile chip , found in the Orange San Diego , Intel has also done its own tests which apparently show dual-cores can be bad for handsets . Bell said : `` We ran our own numbers and in some of the use cases we 've seen , having a second core is actually a detriment . '' So according to Intel phones do n't need the fancy dual-core and quad-core processors which adorn so many handsets these days , but the likes of Samsung and HTC would probably have something to say about that .

Intel is said to be developing a new breed of set-top box that would use facial recognition to broadcast targeted advertising . The set-top box would n't go as far as identifying specific people , instead gathering information on age and gender . This information is very valuable to advertisers who want to make sure they are putting their products in front of their target audience . The technology would n't just be attractive to advertisers , but TV providers too . In the US , viewing figures come from Nielsen ratings information which is based on a polling system that samples just 50,000 homes . Intel 's living room cameras would be able to pin down the public 's viewing habits more accurately and with more detail . As if having a camera watching you while you watch TV was n't enough of a turn-off for consumers , Intel 's box could also facilitate more secure DRM on streaming content . The deal would no doubt have to be sweetened for consumers to take up the new product – how many free channels would it take to buy your privacy ? Reuters ' sources believe that Intel is aiming to launch the service later this year , though it 's a hard sell for the company : `` They 've told us the technology is going to be so much more interactive with ads that you can make more money . But it 's just a little unproven . '' After its unsuccessful pairing with Google on Google TV , could this be the product that brings Intel chips into the living room ?

Intel is concentrating its mobile efforts on Android at the moment , but that wo n't necessarily be the case in the future . The launch of the Orange San Diego sees the first handset with Intel inside to reach Europe and it comes running Google 's Android mobile platform . Speaking to members of the press , Mike Bell , Vice President Intel Architecture Group said : `` For phones right now , the majority of our efforts are on Android , because that is what people are asking for . `` We 're not opposed to looking at other things , but a customer would have to come to us and ask for it and all the customer is asking for at the moment is Android . '' Intel does have a get out of jail card if the current mobile OS market was to take a turn for the worst , and it comes in the form of Tizen , as Bell reveals Intel has a dedicated team working on it . Bell went on to say : `` Intel has an effort around Tizen , and it 's interesting to me in that you hear a lot about the possible consolidation in the OS space , and we do have something in our back pocket should that happen , but I do n't see it happening . `` I think there are some interesting things you could do with Tizen and I would never rule it out it , but at the moment our customers are asking for Android . '' So Intel has got something stowed away for a rainy day , but until the heavens open it 's quite happy to bang the Android drum for now , until its customers dictate otherwise .
In a round table discussion an Intel representative has hinted that 4-inch mobile displays are just right , with larger screens branded as ridiculous . Intel has recently entered the mobile market , with a second device running its own Medfield processor , the Orange San Diego , now available across Europe . Speaking about the Orange San Diego at the event , Intel 's Vice President of the Architecture Group , Mike Bell said : `` We actually think we built the right sized screen for the majority of people who do n't have hands the size of King Kong . `` I personally think 5-inch screens on phones are ridiculous , I know not everybody agrees with me , but I have a big hand and I still find them difficult to use . '' The Orange San Diego sports a 4.03-inch display , which is larger than the 3.5-inch offering on the iPhone 4S , but is dwarfed by the likes of the HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S3 , both of which have displays nearing 5-inches . Although crazy to compare the San Diego to the Android power-houses , Intel firmly believes it 's produced a top-end handset . Bell said : `` We think the Orange San Diego compares with the highest end of devices . `` We tried to build a phone which had pretty much every feature you could possibly think of , including mobile payments , NFC , HDMI out and so on . `` We did all the engineering effort to produce what would be a high end phone for anyone and Orange decided what price to sell it at . `` We like that Orange is selling it for less . We 're kind of proud of it , because the fact Orange is doing it means they like it enough to think it will be a big hit . '' Time will tell if Intel 's prediction is correct , in the meantime check out our hands on Orange San Diego review for more information on the handset . Do you think Intel should stick to 4-inch mobile phones , or is there a need for plus-size screens ? Let us know your thoughts in the comment box below .

Intel may be facing bleaker-than-expected finances but it 's far from down and out , promising 20 Atom-based Windows 8 tablets and 140 Ultrabooks are in the works . It seems that Intel 's MacBook Air-competing Ultrabook project has been quite a hit with manufacturers , at least , with 140 Ivy Bridge loaded designs currently in development . Talking about Ultrabooks , CEO Paul Otellini said , `` We are very pleased with the level of innovation and invention being brought into this category , and are now tracking over 140 Ivy Bridge-based designs in the pipeline . `` Of those , more than 40 will be touch-enabled , and a dozen will be convertibles . '' He went on to add that Intel is `` confident '' that Ultrabooks will hit the elusive $ 699 ( about £500 ) price point in time for this Christmas . Of Windows 8 tablets , he said , `` We are also tracking more than 20 Windows 8 tablet designs based on our low-power and low-cost Clover Trail Atom SOC , in addition to a number of Core-based tablets . '' From The Verge
Intel has confessed that it is unlikely to hit its targets this year , exacerbating talk that consumers are increasingly looking to tablets rather than PCs or waiting for Windows 8 to launch . Intel had previously suggested 'high single digit growth ' for its revenue in 2012 , but has slahed that to between three and five per cent . The company has insisted that other factors are to blame , but the talk is inevitably about tablets and Windows . `` Emerging markets , especially China and Brazil , are still growing nicely but are moderating due to GDP adjustments and currency fluctuations , '' Intel chief executive Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call . The rise of the tablet has been well documented , with Intel playing catch-up to a host of competitors in the mobile chip market , many of them using ARM designs . Another factor is the impending launch of Windows 8 , which could be preventing businesses and consumers from making a PC purchase until it launches later this year . Even this could be less of a win for Intel than it has proved in the past , with the next generation of Windows also making an appearance on ARM devices , breaking away from the Intel x86 platform for the first time . Regardless of what is causing the problem , Intel is aware that the landscape in computing is changing hugely , and the company 's big challenge now is to make sure that its dominance of the chip industry does not wane . Via Reuters
Visual computing . Remember that ? It was the buzzphrase from Intel 's IDF shindig in San Francisco in 2008 . No , I ca n't remember that far back either . I had to leaf through the dusty TechRadar annals to dig up the date . Of course , the next big thing for Intel back then as well as being one of the supposed main drivers of visual computing was the ill-fated Larrabee graphics chip . It looked extremely exciting at the time , what with its programmable architecture and x86 origins . But it was an idea ahead of its time . PC graphics , it turns out , is pretty competitive . And Larrabee was n't up to snuff . So it got nixed . Or rather it morphed into a co-processor for highly parallelised industry computing . As far as I 'm aware , nobody has really been buying Larrabee based products as yet . It 's still in the evaluation phase with a commercial product , codenamed Knights Corner and to be sold under the Xeon Phi brand , due out later this year or maybe 2013 . But that does n't matter . What does is that the brave new world of vector-accelerated visual computing promised by Larrabee is still on Intel 's roadmap for desktop PCs and it may yet have a huge impact on your computing experience , but perhaps not as you 'd imagined . There are three closely linked issues in play here . One is the question of when , if ever , integrated graphics will ever be good enough for high quality gaming . The other is whether today 's model of discrete CPU and graphics chip will be entirely usurped by system-on-a-chip ( SoC ) designs before that can happen . The last is whether Intel will still support discrete graphics for consumer PCs when it does . What we can say for certain is that none of this will happen with Intel 's next big architectural shift , known as Haswell . You can read all about Haswell shortly in a TechRadar deep dive written by yours truly , so keep your scanners peeled for that . But in this context , Haswell does n't do anything all that exciting in terms of either graphics or integration for desktop PCs . It has much more powerful 3D hardware . But it 's largely the same old GenX architecture as seen in the current Intel HD Graphics , just with a load more cores . The follow up to Haswell is Broadwell , which is essentially a 14nm die shrink of 22nm Haswell as decreed by Intel 's Tick-Tock new-architecture-then-die-shrink development cadence , as the marketing patois goes . That means it carries over the Haswell graphics architecture . It 's no child of Larrabee , in other words . However , it is taking a step closer to SoC status by moving the PCH chip ( otherwise known as the southbridge ) onto the CPU package for all consumer models ( some Haswell chips for ultrabook PCs will also have the PCH inside the CPU package ) . Where things get really interesting , however , is the next chip along the line , known as Skylake , due out 2015 . Now , it 's a little too far out for any of this to be set in stone . But my understanding is that Skylake will be both a true single-chip SoC and finally deliver on the Larrabee promise of a fully flexible graphics pipeline and one that blurs the line between CPU and GPU . The question is , with Skylake 's greater level of integration , will Intel leave the door open for attaching ultra high bandwidth peripherals , ie graphics cards ? Or will it take the unilateral decision that its integrated graphics is good .

ZTE 's new flagship handset is its first with Intel inside , with the ZTE Grand X IN rocking an Atom processor and Ice Cream Sandwich . If the name and look seem familiar , it 's because the ZTE Grand X is barely out of short trousers ; but crucially does n't feature the Intel hardware ( hence the IN suffix ) . The Intel Atom Z2460 chip with 1GB of RAM comes with a 4.3-inch QHD screen and 4GB of memory expandable to 32GB by way of microSD . It 's going to allow for HSPA+ speeds of up to 21Mbps . The Grand X IN also has an 8MP camera with flash and 0.3MP front-facing snapper for video calling and unflattering , jowly self-portraits . Capable of recording and playing 1080p footage , the Grand X IN is also DLNA compatible and has an NFC chip for wireless data transfer and contactless payments . ZTE 's new flagship handset will be coming to Europe this September , although there 's no word on pricing or whether it 'll get an upgrade to Jelly Bean yet either . The handset was launched over at IFA 2012 , where we currently have our phone hounds sniffing out a sample , so stay tuned for the TechRadar 's hands on ZTE Grand X IN review , coming soon .

Lenovo 's first Windows 8 tablet is likely to arrive with an ARM system as well as an Intel-based option , say reports this weekend . The Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga tablet / laptop hybrid , which was unveiled at CES in January , is likely to arrive around the same time as the Windows 8 launch in the last week of October . We knew there would be an Intel-powered version , but ABC has 'confirmed ' that an ARM device running the specially tailored Windows RT operating system will go on sale alongside it . The tablet-friendly Windows RT version will be lower-powered , but boast double the battery life , according to ABC 's sources The Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga was one of the must-see products at this year 's CES expo . The super-thin laptop has a 13.1-inch rotating touchscreen which flips around to become a tablet , a 256GB SSD and 8GB RAM . It weighs in at just 1.47kg and is 16.9mm thick . When flipped the IdeaPad will convert from the traditional Windows desktop mode to the new touch-friendly Metro UI . Via : ABC

Intel is getting ready for Windows 8 with the Atom Processor Z2760 , the company announced Thursday . Formerly codenamed Clover Trail , this new mobile processor runs up to 1.8GHz . `` The Intel Atom Processer Z2760 allows for the thinnest , lightest tablets built on Intel architecture - as thin as 8.5 millimeters and as light as 1.5 pounds - making carrying and storing a powerful tablet less cumbersome and more convenient , '' the company said in a press release . It 's a dual-core , four-thread SoC that makes for long battery life - more than three weeks of connected standby and more than 10 hours of local HD video playback . The Z2760 also uses 32nm process technology with second-generation high-k metal gate transistors , to boot . According to Intel , the Z2760 symbolizes the company 's foray into the world of tablets . `` This is just the beginning of Intel 's effort in the tablet market , and our goal is to deliver products that fit the spectrum of evolving needs of both consumers and business users without compromising on compatibility , experience or battery life , '' said Erik Reid , general manager , Application Processor Platforms for Intel 's Mobile and Communications Group . `` When people or corporations buy a device with Intel Inside , they 're getting the best of Windows 8 features with a computing experience that just works . '' Designed for low-power consumption , the chip will power Windows 8 tablets and tablet convertibles from manufacturers such as Acer , ASUS , Dell , Fujitsu , LG , Samsung , ZTE , and more . TechRadar previously covered Clover Trail Atom chips powering tablets and tablet convertibles like the Acer Iconia W510 and the Asus Vivo Tab . In fact , Intel previously confirmed that at least 20 Windows 8 tablets were on the way , sporting its new chip . The battery-sipping Atom Z2760 is designed for efficent power use in compact , highly portable devices , aimed at matching the demand for built-in security and manageability found in Windows 8 , Intel said . The processor offers Secure Boot and firmware-based Intel Platform Trust Technology . Other specs for the Z2760 include integrated graphics with up to 533MHz graphics core frequency and hardware acceleration support for 1080p video encode and decode . It offers support for one internal MIPI-DSI or LVDS display in addition to one external HDMI 1.3 display . Loaded with Intel Burst and Hyper-Threading Technology , the Z2760 comes with an integrated 32-bit dual channel memory controller and LPDDR2 support and 800 MT/s data rates up to 2GB . An integrated ISP with support for an HD camera ( up to 8MP ) and secondary camera ( up to 2.1MP ) , the processor also comes with an embedded multimedia card at 4.41 . TechRadar will be in attendance at an Intel event at 12 p.m. PDT Thursday , so stay tuned to see what more Intel has inside .
Intel has reiterated its love for Windows 8 , just one day after CEO Paul Otellini was reported as saying the OS is not yet ready for launch . A Bloomberg article on Tuesday featured word from a company employee in Taipei , who claimed Otellini told Taiwanese workers that Microsoft was pushing the software out before it was ready in order cash in on the Christmas rush . Otellini is also said to have made clear his concerns about the need for improvement and also the amount of bugs that still exist within the operating system . The comments were deemed explosive as they come just one month from the official launch date of October 26 , with Microsoft having sent the final build to its manufacturing partners . Intel has now issued a statement claiming that the reports are `` unsubstantiated '' and reiterated Otellini 's earlier assurances that `` Windows 8 is one of the best things that ever happened to Intel . '' Intel 's speedy response to the Bloomberg report comes as the chip maker and software giant prepare to launch a joint Ultrabook assault , powered by Windows 8 . Any suggestion , from perhaps Microsoft 's most important launch partner , that Windows 8 is n't quite up to scratch would surely cause a few red faces at both organisations , especially with AMD ready to step in . Intel interestingly said that Otellini 's alleged remarks were `` unsubstantiated '' rather than simply claiming the report was `` untrue , '' so what did he really say ? Intel 's full statement on the matter is as follows : `` Intel has a long and successful heritage working with Microsoft on the release of Windows platforms , delivering devices that provide exciting experiences , stunning performance , and superior compatibility . Intel fully expects this to continue with Windows 8 . `` Intel , Microsoft , and our partners have been working closely together on testing and validation to ensure delivery of a high-quality experience across the nearly 200 Intel-based designs that will start launching in October . `` Intel CEO Paul Otellini is on record as saying `` Windows 8 is one of the best things that ever happened to Intel , '' citing the importance of the touch interface coming to mainstream computing and the huge wave of exciting new ultrabook , tablet , and convertible device innovations coming to the market .

Developers , users , and Microsoft , perhaps most of all , are eagerly awaiting the Oct. 26 release of the Windows 8 operating system , what could be the biggest thing for Washington-based company since Windows 95 . However , what we see that Friday might not be a fully baked version , at least according to Intel 's CEO . Speaking before employees in Taipei Tuesday , Otellini reportedly said the OS is launching before it 's ready , with improvements still needed . According to Otellini , Microsoft is anxious to get its operating system out in the world , especially as other companies ' devices , like the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 - as well as Microsoft 's own Surface tablet - need it in order to function . Although the Windows 8 OS wo n't be quite ready by Halloween , Otellini reportedly told the gathered group that Microsoft 's strategy revolves around getting the system into computers and tablets before the holidays . It 's actually the right move , Otellini said , allowing Microsoft to grab some market share and release improvements after the fact . Intel is Microsoft 's closest partner , according to Bloomberg . However , critics like Michael Cherry of Directions on Microsoft - a business that provides independent analysis of Microsoft technology , licensing , and strategy - have expressed concerns about an incomplete OS . Cherry reportedly said that although the system is fundamentally sound , it lacks `` robust applications '' that prevent PC makers from fixing problems in `` drivers , '' or the devices that connect hardware to software , such as printers . Another critic wrote a research note on Sept. 13 addressing similar disquiet . `` We are concerned at the level of bugs and fine tuning that appears necessary to get the beta systems we demoed ready for prime time , '' Alex Gauna , an analyst with JMP Securities , wrote in response to versions of Window 8 shown at a recent Intel developers ' forum . Although , by all appearances , Microsoft is confident in moving forward with its scheduled release , history has shown that launching an unfinished OS can backfire , as was the case with Vista in 2007 . That company launched a late version of Windows that flopped as it initially did n't work with many applications and drivers . Meanwhile , a Microsoft spokesman told Bloomberg that , thanks to more than 16 million active preview participants , Windows 8 has undergone rigorous testing and review and is `` [ the most ] ready operating system in Microsoft 's history . '' With a host of devices set to launch along with the OS , no matter what state of readiness it finds itself in , Microsoft stands to at least cash in on the excitement of an operating system that is n't iOS or Android hitting the market . TechRadar has reached out to Microsoft for further comment and will update this story if and when we receive information from the company . Via Bloomberg

Intel has confirmed that its current Medfield processor found in the likes of the Orange San Diego and Motorola Razr i ( Droid Razr M in the US ) does not offer support for LTE . However Intel is working on a solution , and Sumeet Syal , Intel 's director of product marketing told Tech Crunch that it was planning on `` shipping some LTE products later this year and ramping into 2013 '' . As 4G becomes more and more popular around the world , Intel needs to get a move on with its LTE-enabled handsets , otherwise it risks being left behind by the already well-established Nvidia , ARM and Texas Instruments . Alongside 4G-enabled processors , Intel is also reportedly working on a dual-core version of the Medfield chip – which could rival the quad-core chips found in the likes of the international versions of the HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S3 . Syal said : `` Our next gen product will be a dual-core but again that product will also have hyper threading so essentially… you will also have dual-core with four threads . `` So again just like we demoed that a single core hyper-threaded can outperform dual-core/quad-core I think we 'll do it again when we introduce the dual-core product with four threads . '' Currently there 's no information regarding the 4G or dual-core handsets Intel has up its sleeve , but we 'll keep our eyes and ears open for any more information . From Tech Crunch

Intel is set to reveal its Windows 8 tablet plans and talk new chips at a manufacturer-endorsed event ahead of the big Windows 8 launch . A number of big-name manufacturers head up the RSVP list , with Acer , Asus , Dell , HP , Lenovo , Samsung and ZTE all set to make an appearance . While most of those companies have already made public their intentions to sell Windows 8 tablets , ZTE has n't . Its attendance at this conference seems a tentative confirmation that the Chinese firm will be releasing some form of Windows 8 tablet in the near future . As well as the tablet talk , Intel is set to reveal more information about Atom , the chips that it hopes will drag the company into the mobile limelight . The Intel Windows 8 tablet event is set for September 27 , ahead of the official Windows 8 launch which is expected to take place on October 25 . From Engadget

Intel has successfully managed to get Android 4.1 Jelly Bean running on its Medfield processor . The completed port means that phones like the Intel-toting Orange San Diego and ZTE Grand X IN should continue to receive software updates beyond Android 4.0 . Do n't go cracking out the bubbly just yet though , as there 's no word on if or when the Jelly Bean update will officially hit consumer 's Intel phones . Intel 's VP and general manager of mobile Mike Bell said that 'multiple ' Intel employees are using Medfield phones with Jelly Bean , including himself . He explained that the company ca n't guarantee when the software will make it to phones : `` We ca n't put it on the phones . We have to give it to the carriers to put on the phones and they go through acceptance testing , '' Intel will be pleased though ; the completed port sends a clear message to other manufacturers that Intel is committed to Android and will perhaps entice a few more phone makers away from ARM .

Intel has been talking up next year 's new processor graphics architecture in the 4th Generation Core , code-named Haswell . That 's been the most interesting thing to come out of the first day of this year 's IDF , especially after the otherwise underwhelming inaugural keynote . As the successor to the Ivy Bridge platform you kinda know what to expect ; faster , more power efficient , the usual . While we do n't really expect any real ground-breaking improvements in CPU performance , and we 're assured there 'll be no extra cores to play with , what is impressing us so far is the graphics performance . In the first Keynote Dadi Perlmutter , Intel big-wig , showed us a demo of an Ivy Bridge Ultrabook up against an open Haswell system of the same relative standing . The graphics performance in Unigine 's Heaven benchmark was impressive against the current gen graphics , shifting around at twice the speed . That means it 's running the benchmark at an incredibly smooth frame rate , while it 's also running within the same power envelope as the Ivy Bridge machine . So you 're not going to need any extra juice in your laptop to make with the graphical gaming goodness . Perlmutter showed a second video , demonstrating how the Haswell architecture performs when the power levels are dropped to around 10W . At those levels you 're getting the same sort of graphical performance , maybe even slightly better , as an Ivy Bridge machine running at nearly twice that Wattage . While low power stuff is great , we love the fact that gaming performance is already looking so good ¨C and this is all before the Intel developer relations guys start helping the gaming crowd optimise their engines for Haswell . At these levels the low-end discrete graphics cards have got to be looking over their shoulder . I spoke with Tom Piazza , Intel Senior Fellow and graphics guru , and asked whether this shows Intel chasing down the mid-range discrete graphics cards . `` If we wanted to do six times the graphics performance we could do that now , '' he said . But he explained that 's not the real point behind the efforts Intel has been making in power efficiency . Being able to double the performance of its previous CPU graphics is still pretty impressive and being able to do that at the same power levels doubly so . So we 're not looking at Intel chasing down the discrete graphics crowd , the high-end and mid-range will remain the domain of the discrete desktop card . `` People still build Maseratis and Ferraris , because some people demand that sort of power . '' But in the gaming laptop market we could see Intel making some serious in-roads into that area , still scaring those discrete graphics guys . The GT3E , the top-end Haswell graphics SKU , could result in all-Intel gaming laptops sticking it to the new generation of consoles as well as the other , discrete card-touting laptops next year .
The biggest thing to come out of this morning 's opening keynote at IDF 2012 was the evolution in the way we interact with our computers , interacting with them in a more human-like way . Boiling that down , it means using the same varied ways we interact with each other and applying that to computing . We touch , we talk and we gesture to each other `` this is the evolution in computer interaction that Intel wants to help drive with next year 's 4th Generation of Core architecture , code-named Haswell . '' While that CPU itself is a while away , what we did see though was this notion of evolved interaction . The first real-world offering came from a company called Nuance , who is already on its 12th version of the Dragon voice recognition software . Perlmutter and his demo-lacky , Craig , showed the results of a collaboration between Intel and Nuance on a new version of its Dragon software , paired with a current-gen Dell 13 XPS . Permutter was keen to point out it was n't a cloud-based system and `` requires the high-performance of the CPU and computing capabilities inside . '' Intel has worked with Nuance on this next version , available in beta in the fourth quarter of the year and says `` the work with Nuance is predominantly tailoring the application , tuning the application . Voice recognition is not a small , easy task . And we 're working with them on future capabilities that we 're not announcing today . '' It was very much a Siri-like setup , with the operator first waking up the Dragon with a cheery `` hello Dragon '' and from there interacting with it to search through Google , tweet about what they were looking for and then finally playing some music . It was all very seamless , unlike some of the other Lenovo tablet demos we were `` treated '' to . Dragon responded quickly and accurately , even down to understanding complex song requests and playing musical genres rather than individual songs . What was n't made clear though was how this was going to be paired up with the next generation of Ultrabooks that will be coming next year . The current top-of-the-line Dragon Premium software runs into the hundreds of pounds , but for this to be picked up by the mainstream market it 's going to have to come pre-installed `` without a huge premium attached '' when you buy your Ultrabook . But seeing how desperate Intel is to get the Ultrabook brand out there we would n't be surprised to see it footing much of the bill itself . Perlmutter also demoed gesture recognition through a Kinect-like 3D camera from Creative and the SoftKinetic recognition software . It sat atop a laptop 's panel , but he says that in a year or two 3D cameras will be integrated into the laptop itself , just like a traditional webcam is now .
Intel unveiled its vision of the future Tuesday , an adaptive desktop computer with a tablet display that can be carried around the house . Krik Skaugen , head of Intel 's PC Client business , revealed the `` all-in-one '' computer with a portable 20-inch ( or larger ) screen that can be attached to multiple bases and keyboards . Skaugen said the screen will likely have its own on-board intelligence and battery , so it can operate without a base . It 'll also run on Windows 8 , Microsoft 's touch-friendly operating system . Speaking about the concept at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco , Skaugen said the `` desktap '' ( as dubbed by Sony ) will be available for consumers this fall . One of the first versions of this type of all-in-one computer is the Sony Vaio Tap 20 . Skaugen reportedly showed off the product by unplugging it and carrying it around the room . He then laid the tablet down and used his fingers as a paintbrush on the touchpad . All-in-one computers have been popular in the past because they take up less space and have fewer wires and components than traditional desktop computers . However , up until now these types of computers have been more stationary . With more portable devices like the iPad already blurring the lines of desktop and mobile computing , a powerful desktop that can be carried around the home is just the next logical step , Skaugen said . The all-in-one adaptive computer could replace a host of devices consumers already own . `` The lines between the categories are disappearing , '' Skaugen said at the conference . He predicts these types of adaptive all-in-one computers will be one of the next big markets for computer makers in the near future . Via VentureBeat
Voice recognition specialist Nuance has announced a version of its Dragon software for Intel-based Ultrabook laptops . The Dragon Assistant Beta will be available for download later this year for owners of the super-slim MacBook Air botherers and will soon come as standard on all Ultrabook computers . During a demonstation at the Intel Developer 's Forum on Tuesday , the software was used to send tweets , search for products on shopping sites , find content on YouTube , play music and more . The first Ultrabook to come with Dragon Assistant built-in will be the Dell XPS13 laptop , later this year . The press release from Nuance offers further explanation on the how the software will work . It says : `` Dragon Assistant uses Nuance 's core Dragon voice technology and innovative natural language understanding capabilities to provide people with an easy and intuitive way to engage and interact with their devices . Simply say `` Hello Dragon '' to awaken Dragon Assistant , and from there , just speak to search the web for content , information and shopping ; access , discover and play music ; check and reply to email ; and , listen to and update social media statuses . Dragon Assistant also provides direct access to the most popular content providers for content on the web . For instance , people can say `` Search YouTube for Justin Bieber . '' `` When finished using Dragon Assistant , simply say `` Go to sleep '' for the application to stop listening . '' A full version of the software , which is the first fruit to be yielded from a strategic partnership between Intel and Nuance , is expected in early 2013 . Via : Zdnet

Sources are reporting that information about Intel 's upcoming Ivy Bridge successor , the energy-efficient ( codename ) Haswell microarchitecture , leaked ahead of Tuesday 's Intel Developer 's Forum ( IDF ) . Haswell chips will reportedly clock in at only 10 watts , cutting the power usage of the most efficient Ivy Bridge processors nearly in half . TechRadar reached out to Intel for more information , and a representative from the Santa Clara , Calif. company confirmed that `` the new line will be about 10 watts . '' Intel has promised more information on the Haswell chips at this week 's IDF conference . `` Last year when we set out to reinvigorate the industry around Ultrabooks , we said we 'd cut the mainstream mobile processor design power in half to enable this new category of laptops , '' Intel 's rep told TechRadar . `` We 've been really pleased with these initial systems , which are getting great reviews . '' But Haswell will be the first chip `` built from the ground up with the Ultrabook in mind , '' Intel said , `` and tomorrow , we 're saying that it 's going better than expected . '' The Intel spokesperson said the new chips will be `` targeted to operate at about 10 watts initially , while continuing to preserve many of the other benefits of Intel Core processor including leading performance , low idle power , single-chip packaging , and new graphics & security capabilities . '' It 's long been reported that Intel 's Haswell architecture will focus on cutting power usage . In August 2011 , TechRadar reported that Intel would be investing heavily in Ultrabooks , saying that the eventual Haswell processor could consume half the power of current chips . Now sources are speculating that the energy-efficient Haswell processors , made all the more impressive by integrated GPUs that could put many discrete graphics processors to shame , could indicate Intel 's growing desire to enter the mobile and tablet arenas . New markets in which to compete could prove a major boon for Intel , whose lowered Q3 2012 estimates and gradually falling stocks have recently had analysts worried . Now all eyes and ears turn to IDF on Tuesday to learn what Intel 's going to be up to for the next few years . Via Hot Hardware

Intel is one of the top chipmakers in the world , but according to analysts ' predictions and the Santa Clara , Calif. company 's own financial outlook , things are not looking up in the PC business . Reuters reports that at least eight analysts have shared bad tidings for Intel , with poor economies in major markets ( Europe , the U.S. and China ) and increasing demand for mobile devices ( versus desktops/laptops ) to blame . A report from Gartner in July claimed that PC sales had fallen flat for the seventh quarter in a row during the second half of 2012 . And another analyst , Citigroup 's Glen Yeung , told CNBC on Friday that `` the worst third quarter in the history of PCs '' is right around the corner . `` I would point out that this is the first time ever that Microsoft has changed operating systems , and it 's not just PCs , '' Yeung said . `` This time , there 's a tablet involved , there 's a smartphone involved . '' Intel 's lowered its own third-quarter revenue estimate , citing `` weaker than expected demand in a challenging macroeconomic environment . '' Intel rolled back its estimates by a full eight percent , a figure Reuters claims is `` much more severe than expected . '' And Intel 's shares have fallen 11 percent since the end of April . Blame poor economies all you want , but the fact is that Intel has fallen behind in the processor arms race , losing ground to chipmakers like Qualcomm in the mobile arena . With forecasts so low , what can Intel do to bolster its fortunes ? Intel is looking forward to Microsoft 's impending Windows 8 launch with hope in its heart and dollar signs where its eyes should be . Intel 's Ivy Bridge chip successor `` Haswell '' is expected to be introduced for the 2013 holiday season , and as TechRadar pointed out in the past , Haswell chips are estimated to consume half the power of current processors . That makes them a huge draw for energy-conscious customers and those craving better battery life . Meanwhile , Intel 's current Ivy Bridge architecture will power Windows 8 PCs in the fall . Any number of those factors could combine to sell some PCs in the next year or so . In fact , Intel 's counting on it . Via Reuters , Reuters , CNET

Intel believes that Windows RT falls short of the full Windows 8 experience , with a senior executive telling TechRadar that compatibility with old software and peripherals will remain a key issue for the ARM-based version of Microsoft 's new operating system . For the first time , Microsoft has made its Windows OS available on a platform not based on Intel 's longstanding x86 . And to rub salt in the wounds , Microsoft has opted to make its own tablet that uses ARM architecture and Windows RT , with the Surface a key new player in the market . However , speaking to TechRadar , Karen Regis – Intel 's director for Ultrabook marketing strategy – explained why the chip giant was comfortable that more people would opt for Windows 8 than Windows RT . `` With Windows 8 you 're going to be able to take your whole library of software that you have invested in over the years and port it over to your new system , '' said Regis . `` You 're going to have full functionality and compatibility with your peripherals . `` Microsoft made a claim about 420 million devices worked with RT but I think a lot of those are going to have class drivers only , so your printer might work but will you be able to select the number of copies or two sided printing or print quality ? `` With [ Windows 8 on x86 machines ] you know you are going to be able to . '' TechRadar asked Regis how she felt about ARM 's growing influence , and whether the competition was welcome . `` I do n't know if I would say it 's welcome competition , '' she responded , `` but we feel pretty good about the fact that you are going to get full PC compatibility and functionality out of our devices . `` There are going to be a lot of Atom devices as well which will offer the same kind of compatibility with applications and you will not have to give up on your library of iTunes content that can come with you . `` There 's a lot of goodness that you are going to get on the i8 based systems that we think make it a much better experience for Windows 8 than the competition .

Intel 's chief technology officer believes the company 's research arm has a key role to ditch expensive failures before they can reach the market . `` Let me suggest that there 's another role for an industrial research institution . And that 's to prevent poor technologies from ever reaching the market . Product failures – at least in our industry – are extremely expensive , '' says Justin Rattner . As well as being chief technology officer for the multinational chip giant , Rattner is also Director of Intel Labs . TechRadar joined Rattner at an Intel Labs get together in Barcelona , where the lab has just celebrated its 10th anniversary in the Catalan city . `` A typical mainstream processor will cost well above $ 500 million in development and will be built in a fab costing ten times that , so you 're talking about an investment in the order of around $ 5 billion dollars . `` If a product flops because of a bad technology decision made somewhere earlier in the technology development , that 's really a big problem . And yet , some failures can and do happen . Sometimes they 're not public , and sometimes are very public . '' Rattner chuckles at this point , perhaps remembering the complete flop of Intel 's last-generation Pentium 4 processor . The Prescott chip was power hungry , hot and convinced Intel that it had to change direction and focus on mobile with the Banias Pentium M and subsequent move to the Core microarchitecture . `` I think a 21st century research lab can see a main of its role is to weed out the bad [ tech ] . We refer to this as 'failing fast ' and it 's something that we consider as important to the long term success of Intel as all the things we do on the innovations side . '' Moreover , Rattner says that researchers should celebrate weeding out these failures and says that other labs are n't doing things right if they 're too focused on the future picture rather than sense-checking products . `` It should be the responsibility of every research lab to celebrate these kinds of internal failures as well as internal successes There are still a number of companies chasing their vision . We believe these labs are increasingly out of step [ with everybody else ] . '' `` The sooner you grasp the cost of failure [ you appreciate how important this work is ] . It climbs exponentially the closer you get to product delivery . So we 'd rather have a million dollar or ten million dollar failure in the lab than a billion dollar or multi-billion dollar failure in the factory . `` Every once in a while everybody 's talking about some chip that someone put out where something has gone awry – trust me that costs Intel hundreds of millions of dollars . Some of those failures are almost legendary . Rattner also says that a research lab can help with situations where a product might fail in the market rather than being a technical failure . `` The market for technology has really changed in the last decade , even the last 4 or 5 years , he says . `` Customers are beyond the point where technical novelty sells the product . `` People are looking for solutions that make their lives better or more fun or making things [ better ] in the corporate space . So at Intel there 's another transformation under way to come at future products from that perspective as opposed to 'well , we 've got a billion transistors , can we just throw everything including the kitchen sink into it and people will just buy it because it 's cool and the spec sheet goes on for pages ' . Those days , if not completely over , are numbered . `` In the labs , we take on the question market success by creating capability that really goes directly to consumers and customers to find out if a product will be a success .

Intel 's latest financial report has revealed a significant though not quite dramatic drop in company revenues to $ 13.5 billion ( UK£8.4 billion , AU $ 13.1 ) . The figures , culled from Q3 financial data , were down 5.1 per cent from the $ 14.23 billion ( UK£8.82 billion , AU $ 13.86 ) the company pulled in during the same 3-month period one year ago . The chip-maker rang up profits of $ 3 billion ( UK£1.86 , AU $ 2.9 ) during the last three months , with earnings of $ 0.58 ( UK£0.36 , AU $ 0.57 ) per share , beating the estimates of Wall Street 's finest . Intel CEO Paul Otellini said in a statement that he was pleased with how the company is holding up during a time when PC sales are slowing , and spoke positively about Intel 's Ultrabook and mobile ventures . `` Our third-quarter results reflected a continuing tough economic environment , '' he said . `` The world of computing is in the midst of a period of breakthrough innovation and creativity . `` As we look to the fourth quarter , we 're pleased with the continued progress in Ultrabooks and phones and excited about the range of Intel-based tablets coming to market . '' Intel 's Atom-based smartphones finally hit the market in 2012 with further developments expected in 2013 , while the company recently revealed it will power around 20 Windows 8 tablets along with 140 Core-based Ultrabooks moving forward . Although Intel is attempting to adapt to an increasingly mobile world , Otellini reportedly gave little mention of the company 's projects in that vein , saying only that Intel is `` continuing to make progress in handhelds . '' The CEO also apparently mused over whether a decline in PC use is due to the rise in tablets or whether consumers are simply waiting for Windows 8 . While `` very excited '' for the new OS , Otellini cautioned that it could take a year before the market knows whether PC use will ever return to prior levels . Despite beating the estimates and posting better than expected results , Intel shares dropped 2.4 per cent in after-hours trading Tuesday . Via Forbes , The Verge

Personal cloud storage is experiencing explosive growth , and chipmaker Intel is ready to carve out a piece of the market for itself with new Atom-powered solutions . Aimed at small business users as well as consumers , Intel is providing network-attached storage solutions starting at $ 299 ( UK£185 , AU $ 293 ) , powered by the company 's Atom D2550 or D2500 processors . With OEM partners Asustor , QNAP , and Thecus already shipping NAS systems powered by Intel 's architecture , the chip provider 's plans are to keep up with the rapidly expanding cloud storage needs of regular users . `` Ballooning data is a fact of life , '' Intel Storage Group General Manager David Tuhy remarked while introducing the company 's new cloud storage platform at a media briefing Thursday . Intel , citing figures from the Aberdeen Group , a research firm , said small business cloud storage needs are increasing by 30 percent each year . Consumer cloud use is expected to grow from 329 exabytes to a whopping 4.1 zettabytes , a figure that blows gigabytes out of the water . Tuhy cited protection and privacy as the biggest concern of the consumer and SMB customers they 're targeting with the new products . Intel 's solution uses an login-secured , exposed HTML IP address which can be accessed from a web browser or appear as a mounted volume on a desktop computer . In addition to sharing devices on a local area network , Intel 's NAS products include RAID data protection , integrated support for digital displays , hardware acceleration , multiple OS support with up to 4GB of memory and USB 3.0 connectivity .

Apple is still reeling from its transition from Google Maps to iOS 6 Maps on the iPhone , but the Cupertino company looks as if it is n't finished making big changes with long-time partners . Intel may be the next partner on the chopping block . Apple is reportedly considering moving away from using Intel 's CPUs , according to two unnamed sources talking with Bloomberg Businessweek . This would be a tremendous shift , as Intel 's line of microprocessors are at the heart of all of Apple 's current computers . The MacBook Pro , MacBook Pro Retina , and MacBook Air use Intel 's latest Ivy Bridge chip , while the iMac , Mac Pro , and Mac mini have previous Intel processors and are due for an Intel chip update . The move away from Intel would be difficult , but not unprecedented for Apple . After all , it designed its own mobile system-on-a-chip with the original iPad and on the iPhone 4 in 2010 . The iPhone 5 contains the latest Apple-designed chip example , the A6 . This processor is also expected to run the next iPad , speculated to be the long-rumored iPad Mini . The second reason that the move would n't be unprecedented is that it would n't be the first major chip transition by Apple . From 1994 to 2006 , all of Apple 's computers used the IBM-designed PowerPC chips before moving to Intel 's line of CPUs . Adding to the theory that Apple may one day send Intel to the woodchipper is the revelation the company 's looking to hire its own lead system-on-a-chip designer . The `` SoC Modeling Architect - Manager / Lead '' job ad , picked up by TechCrunch , may simply have its sights set on a designer for a future A7 processor . However , nothing in the description said that Apple is strictly looking for someone with a mobile background . Whether or not Apple is looking for a computer-related system-on-a-chip designer now , there 's growing speculation that it may be in the Mac-based chip design business in the near future .

Apple 's MacBook Air , MacBook Pro , iMac and Mac Mini include a connectivity technology called Thunderbolt . But what is it ? The answer , is that it 's actually a rebrand of Intel 's long-talked of Light Peak technology – Light Peak , it appears , was a codename . Thunderbolt is a new cable interface enabling you to connect up compatible devices – and , crucially , existing devices too . Thunderbolt also supports electrical cables as well as optical and it 's this version of Thunderbolt that 's in Apple 's laptops . Read : New MacBook Pro review - with retina display As Apple says , `` Thunderbolt delivers PCI Express directly to external high performance peripherals such as RAID arrays , and can support FireWire and USB consumer devices and Gigabit Ethernet networks via adaptors . '' The tech also supports DisplayPort for HD displays and can , through more adaptors , connect up HDMI , DVI and VGA displays . So it 's a connector that can replace literally all other connectors on your PC . Wow . If you 're a peripherals manufacturer , you should be making Thunderbolt adaptors for everything , right now . So how fast is it ? There 's massive bandwidth available with Thunderbolt – up to 10 Gbps , which could grow by up to 10 times that by 2020 . Thunderbolt means you can now transfer an entire Blu-ray disc in 30 seconds or a year 's worth of back-to-back MP3s in 10 minutes . And it 's dual-channel , which means information can flow both ways , as you can see here : Thunderbolt can also power bus-powered devices over the connections while Intel promises that files can have highly accurate time synchronisation too . Intel demonstrated the technology inside a laptop nearly a year ago when it sent two HD video streams across a single Light Peak connection . You can also daisy chain devices , seemingly without performance loss – there 's a video of that in action here . Of course , Light Peak is intended as a replacement for current connectivity standards including USB and eSATA – in fact , it could be a replacement for all storage and display standards . Suddenly the MacBook Air , with its single USB port , does n't look so limited . Surely MacBook Air 2011 means you 'll be able to connect up everything via a single port . It clearly shows Apple also believes in Intel 's new technology . Of course , that does n't automatically mean it will be a success . Apple also put the ExpressCard into the MacBook Pro a while back and , due to the rise in wireless connectivity and USB mobile broadband , that has died a death . However , because this looks to be such a groundbreaking technology , it surely will seep into competing laptops and netbooks before long – depending on the duration of Apple 's inevitable exclusivity deal of course . Despite the huge potential for connecting to legacy display and storage standards , Thunderbolt will also need mass adoption inside PCs for external display and storage devices to use it natively . One thing 's for sure , if Intel and Apple can force the connection to permeate through the industry , it could be have interesting consequences for USB 3 and eSATA , which are still struggling to get a foothold in the market .
Another Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) has been and gone and still we 're wondering why Intel ca n't do mobile . Right now , ultramobile - tablets and phones - is where it 's at . It 's where all the exciting innovation is happening . It 's where all the growth and money is . So , it 's borderline bizarre that Intel is n't merely failing to dominate . It 's barely in the game . So far there 's been jjust one mass market phone available powered by an Intel processor - the Orange San Diego . One thing 's for sure . If it had some handset design wins to shout about , the likes of Intel 's mobile maestro Dadi Perlmutter would have been prancing around the IDF stage in rapturous triumphalism . In terms of overall numbers to date we 're talking about the fingers on one hand , including the newly-announced Motorola Razr-i . That 's all Intel has to show for nearly five years of retail Atom processor sales . From what I heard , there are even rumours doing the rounds regards Intel pulling the plug on Atom . That could actually make a lot of sense . And it would n't meaning giving up on the ultramobile dream . The most exciting thing that I can see on Intel 's horizon are Windows 8 tablets powered by proper Intel Core chips , not weedy Atom processors . My reasoning here is that if you want a tablet with a relatively feeble processor , there are already plenty to choose from in the form of Apple iPads and various Android tabs . Tablets with ARM-based chips , in other words . Where Windows 8 can make a difference is by fusing the tablet experience with the power of a proper PC . For me , it 's going to take no less a proposition than that to turn punters ' heads . Put another way , the same but a bit different is all Windows 8 on Atom has to offer . And it 's not even close to being good enough . That 's why PC manufacturers are turning to Core . In the long run , maybe the same thinking applies to smartphones . If the Windows-8-plus-Intel-Core proves a success for tablets , there may yet be hope for Intel in smartphones if it can drive its flagship computing architecture into that most ultra of mobile form factors . If that sounds implausible , Intel confirmed at IDF that Moore 's Law is good for another 10 years . In practice , that means 5nm chips by the end of 2020 . In theory , that would make it possible to produce a quad-core Intel Core processor with proportions measuring just over six per cent of today 's 22nm effort . OK , to that you 'll need to add a whole bunch of additional bits to create an SoC fit for a phone But you get the idea . An Intel Core phone chip inside a decade is not science fiction . In truth , nobody outside of Intel knows exactly how it currently intends to crack the ultramobile nut . But I can say this for sure . If it does n't manage it fairly soon , there will literally be no need for Atom because Intel Core processors will have been crushed down to smartphone-esque proportions .

After nearly 40 years of continuous service with the chipmaker , Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini will retire in May as the company steps up efforts to stay relevant in an era of mobile devices . Intel announced Monday that Otellini has entered an `` orderly leadership transition '' timed six months ahead of the company 's annual stockholders ' meeting in May , at which point the executive will retire . `` I 've been privileged to lead one of the world 's greatest companies , '' Otellini said . `` After almost four decades with the company and eight years as CEO , it 's time to move on and transfer Intel 's helm to a new generation of leadership . '' The board of directors will spend the next six months choosing a successor from a wide variety of candidates both internally and externally , with Otellini only the fifth CEO in the company 's 45-year history . Following Otellini 's appointment as CEO in early 2005 , the chipmaker raked in $ 105 billion ( UK£66 billion , AUD $ 100 billion ) from its operations , establishing record revenue from $ 38.8 billion ( UK£24.3 billion , AUD $ 37.2 billion ) to $ 54 billion ( UK£33.9 billion , AUD $ 51.8 billion ) by the end of 2011 . Otellini is also credited with reinventing the PC thanks to Intel 's current push toward Ultrabook devices , although that initiative - and other mobile ambitions - have yet to pay off for the company . Intel Chairman of the Board Andy Bryant said Otellini `` managed the company through challenging times and market transitions . `` The board is grateful for his innumerable contributions to the company and his distinguished tenure as CEO over the last eight years . '' Intel 's board of directors also announced promotions for three senior leaders who will now act as executive vice presidents , including Renee James from the company 's software division , Brian Krzanich from manufacturing and Director of Corporate Strategy Stacy Smith .
Intel 's next generation of tablet chips have been outlined in a leaked roadmap image . The futuristic quad-core Bay Trail-T processor is scheduled for 2014 , with talk of more information being revealed at CES 2013 , including what manufacturers are working on Bay Trail-T tablets . It looks as though the chip will launch in a SoC , codenamed Valleyview-T and should put up a good fight against Nvidia 's Tegra 3 and Qualcomm 's S4 ( albeit a couple of years late to the party ) . Unlike the existing Clover Trail chip , Bay Trail-T uses a 22nm core process , which Intel promises will mean half the power requirements resulting in a 50-60 per cent improvement in performance . In fact , Intel 's slides suggests you 'll be able to play over 11 hours of video on one charge – something we 'll believe when we see , quite frankly . Other benefits should include higher memory capacity , better audio quality and superior graphics performance when coupled with the Gen7 Intel GPU . There 's even the option to include cameras that can record 3D video , although why you 'd ever want to do that on a tablet is quite beyond us . Intel is expected to reveal more about the Bay Trail-T chips at CES 2013 where tablets are again expected to steal the show . From Mobile Geeks via Slashgear

Two chip making rivals are reportedly considering a joint investment worth $ 378 million ( UK£238 , AUD $ 363 ) into struggling consumer electronics company Sharp , according to a new report . Citing two sources familiar with the situation , Reuters revealed the potential revival deal between Intel and Qualcomm Wednesday . Sharp displays are found in iPads and iPhones and the company appears anxious to tap into the small screen and high-end laptop market as a way to resurrect its fortunes . Intel is apparently interested in Sharp 's energy-efficient IGZO displays as it looks to profit in the growing Ultrabook scene . A deal between Sharp and Qualcomm may come as soon as the end of November , one of Reuters ' sources said . Details of an Intel deal are less firm as the company has its own murky financials to contend with . Sharp 's situation is no secret - various reports have it cutting its workforce by almost 11,000 in two years , selling off assets and contending with $ 13.8 billion ( UK£8.71 , AUD $ 13.2 ) in debt . Over the course of 2012 , Sharp has seen three-quarters of its value whither away . Its total lose for the year could reach $ 5.7 billion ( UK£3.59 , AUD $ 5.4 ) , including a $ 1.1 billion ( UK£6.94m , AUD $ 1.05 ) restructuring charge . The firm also reportedly struggled to meet screen supply demands for the popular iPhone 5 , though it later denied those claims . An investment by Intel or Qualcomm , or both , could lay out an entirely new future for Sharp , one that steers it completely away from TV land and wholly towards mobile technology . Via Reuters

The seven-year relationship between Apple and Intel may soon come to an end , at least according to sources speaking with Bloomberg . According to the report , Apple engineers are confident that the chips found in the company 's smartphones and tablets will one day be powerful enough to run laptops and desktops . The news of an Apple/Intel break up is nothing new - TechRadar reported last month that Apple was considering moving away from Intel CPUs and even posted a job opening for an in-house system-on-a-chip architect . Apple has packed Intel chips into its personal computers since 2005 , but now that mobile devices and PCs are becoming more similar , the switch to in-house designs may be inevitable . According to Bloomberg 's sources , Apple engineers foresee a common chip design compatible with both mobile devices and larger computers . Perhaps the most pointed sign of Apple 's intentions is a recent management shift that saw Bob Mansfield become the head of a new group dubbed `` Technologies . '' That department oversees semiconductors and has `` ambitious plans for the future , '' according to Apple 's statement about the management overhaul . Apple 's new iPad 4 packs an A6X processor , a chip that 's two times faster than the one found in older iPads . While this does n't necessarily mean its powerful enough to run a PC , it does indicate Apple has the capability and desire to design ever-better chips . Via Bloomberg

After nine months of speculation about Intel 's alleged cable TV service , a source `` directly familiar with Intel 's plans '' says the company 's plans are moving forward locally . According to TechCrunch , the source claims that after other providers had washed their hands of the failed attempt at Google TV a few years ago , Intel saw real opportunity . The real challenge to overcome in starting a new cable TV service is getting the content providers on-board , which other manufacturers had n't been able to do nationwide . Reportedly , Intel grew tired of `` everyone doing a half-assed Google TV so it 's going to do it themselves and do it right . '' The city-by-city approach that the source says marks Intel 's new strategy seems to offer a lower risk , higher flexibility option for licensing . Whereas content providers may have been leery to enter into large national contracts , Intel appears to be banking on the draw of smaller markets to open up previously untapped licensing potential . Outside of gathering the movies and shows , Intel will also reportedly be making the set top box delivering the content . According to the source , the real strength of Intel 's set top box is access to the last month of content on-demand - essentially a DVR that does n't need to be told to record . Whatever the capability , the source claims that the service will be rolling out to select cities `` soon '' .

Power users planning to get their hands on an Intel Atom-powered Windows 8 tablet may have to wait until late January due to quality control testing from Microsoft . SlashGear reported Wednesday that testing inside Microsoft 's quality assurance lab is holding up the arrival of Intel Atom Z2760-based tablets , including the Dell Latitude 10 . Originally scheduled to ship in mid-December , early Latitude 10 buyers are being told their 10-inch Windows 8 tablet wo n't ship until the new year , with Dell 's website now estimating a ship date of January 22 , 2013 . Worse yet , Dell customer service are notifying would-be buyers that the tablet has not even officially launched yet , despite the company accepting pre-orders since November . The delay is also affecting HP , which is now showing a Jan. 9 ship date in the U.S. for its ENVY x2 11t-g000 convertible tablet with a twisting touchscreen , also previously expected in November . ( UPDATE : This is available in the U.K. currently ) . Sources claim Microsoft 's Windows Hardware Quality Labs are responsible for the holdup , with Intel unable to get approval for the Clover Trail processors used on the Atom Z2760 . The issue is reportedly related to device drivers used with the Clover Trail processors , which have caused stability headaches for Intel . Without approval , the Windows 8 tablets in question can not be legally sold as part of Microsoft 's licensing terms for its OEM partners . Via SlashGear

Shock . Horror . Intel is killing the desktop . So shrieked the internet last week . But is it actually true ? It all starts with Intel 's Broadwell CPU architecture . Due out in 2014 , Broadwell is a 14nm shrink of next year 's Haswell family of CPUs . Haswell , of course , is 22nm just like today 's Intel Ivy Bridge chips , but brings a majorly revised architecture . So , that 's Ivy Bridge in today 's Intel Core i3 , i5 and i7 chips , Haswell to follow next year , and Broadwell to shrink everything down to 14nm in 2014 . Phew . Now the thing about Broadwell is that it 's rumoured to be available only in BGA or ball-grid array format only . Unlike the LGA ( land-grid array ) sockets Intel currently uses for desktop chips , that means it must be soldered onto motherboards . In other words , there will be no mixing and matching of motherboards and CPUs for desktop PCs using Broadwell . They 'll come as a pre-manufactured package . Yikes . The implications of this do n't seem terribly reassuring . What would happen , for instance , if you want a cheap motherboard with an expensive CPU . Will anyone offer that combination ? As far as I know , it 's true that Broadwell will indeed be BGA only . What not clear is whether Broadwell is actually intended for desktop use . Most of Intel 's attention these days when it comes to consumer and client computing platforms is mobile and ultra-mobile . As a die shrink of Haswell , Broadwell is very much a low-power architecture . So , it 's much a mobile-orientated architecture . With that in mind , it 's very plausible to imagine that Broadwell does n't replace Haswell on the desktop at all and that the desktop skips a generation to Skylake ( that 's yet another family of Intel CPUs , sorry ) . And Skylake chips will be available in LGA format . Yay . Well , probably . Intel has form in this area . Back in the days when Lynnfield chips dominated the desktop , Intel released the Westmere generation of CPUs that mostly did duty in mobile platforms . On the desktop , little changed until Sandy Bridge arrived . At this stage , the codenames are getting a little out of control . But all you really have to do is appreciate that the BGA scare has been blown a little out of proportion . For now at least . A few more years down the road and the whole BGA thing may fit into a broader picture of the modern PC that 's not altogether edifying . But that 's a whole different story . In fact , it 's one you can read about shortly ...

Intel is suddenly becoming very interesting . First , word got around that the chip maker might have two tablet processors to show off at CES 2013 - the Bay Trail-T and a SoC called the Valleyview-T . The chips are said to bring quad-core power , long battery lives and a whole lot of improvements that could give Qualcomm 's S4 a taste of its dust . Now we 're seeing a filing from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) containing a tiny label with a load of info . The 20 millimeter by 35 millimeter tag is plastered ( figuratively ) on a device based on Intel 's Red Ridge tablet platform . Red Ridge , you might remember , is based on the company 's Medfield processor . Relatively little has been spoken about Medfield in recent months , and what 's been said is n't entirely positive . Intel successfully ported Android 4.1 : Jelly Bean to Medfield in September , meaning devices like the Orange San Diego and ZTE Grand X IN could get a sugar bump up from Android 4.0 : Ice Cream Sandwich , though that was an internal development with no commercial roll out . What also came to light back then was that the chip could n't support LTE in phones , kind of a `` wa-wa '' in today 's mobile world . However , Intel also said that it was planning to ship LTE products in late 2012 , with deployment ramping up next year . Medfield might even push out a dual-core version to rival quad-core competitors . Could Medfield start the year off with a triumphant debut ... possibly at a major event like , say , CES ? The labeled device the FCC tested ran ICS and housed both Bluetooth and NFC capability . It also picked up 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi . The filing also reveals something tantalizing : the device tested was apparently a production model , meaning a commercial unit could be ready in the next four weeks . That puts the timing squarely in CES territory . While we 're not the gambling type , it sounds like a pretty sure bet Intel could have a Red Ridge-ready , Medfield-packing tablet to show off in Vegas next month . Via Engadget

Updated : In a separate statement to TechRadar , an Intel spokesperson noted that Intel will maintain its server motherboard and server systems ( integrated board , chassis , and accessories ) business through its Enterprise Platforms and Services Division . Original story continues below ... It 's no secret that desktop computers are on the decline , which makes chipmaker Intel 's plans to remove desktop motherboards from its product mix not entirely surprising . AnandTech reported Wednesday that Intel is planning to wind down its desktop motherboard division following the launch of its Haswell-based architecture in 2013 . `` We disclosed internally that Intel 's Desktop Motherboard Business will begin slowly ramping down over the course of the next three years , '' Intel confirmed in a statement to TechRadar . `` As Intel gradually ramps down its motherboard business we are ramping up critical areas of the desktop space including integration of innovative solutions for the PC ecosystem . '' Intel will continue offering desktop chipsets and Form Factor Reference Designs ( FFRDs ) for third-party motherboard suppliers such as ASUS , Gigabyte , MIS and others . `` The desktop segment continues to be a major focus for Intel with hundreds of products across many subsegments and applications , '' Intel 's statement continued . With upwards of 20 years experience in the business , most existing desktop motherboard FFRD talent are expected to remain in place . The complete wind down will take three years to complete , but customers will continue to be supported with a full warranty during that time , which includes upcoming Haswell-based motherboards . Intel plans to shift its focus to FFRDs for Ultrabooks and tablets , with an unknown number of desktop employees being `` redistributed '' to work on the new form factors . The report also cited less current need for Intel 's own motherboards , given the higher quality of third-party product from Taiwan that did not exist in the past . Intel declined to comment on how the shift might impact revenue or sales numbers . Desktop motherboards are considered a low margin product compared to the company 's profit making chipsets , so the change is expected to be good news for investors , though not so good news for those who liked using the mobos to build their own PCs .

Intel has gone the extra nanometre in its celebration of Professor Stephen Hawking 's 70th birthday , presenting the iconic scientist with a custom silicon wafer . The chip giant felt that good old cardboard and glitter was n't nearly good enough for Hawking - and decided that it would inscribe the message 'Happy Birthday Stephen Hawking ' hundreds of time on a one-off 300mm wafer using its 32nm manufacturing process . That meant using nano-scale copper lines for letters ten times narrower than a human hair . Hawking is , of course , recognised as one of the scientific luminaries of our time , winning the Einstein Award , penning A Brief History of Time and theorising that black holes emit radiation . Intel , describing Hawking as 'extraordinary ' , was obviously also keen to highlight that Hawking 's Centre for Theoretical Cosmology uses a Cosmos Mk IX with Intel inside . The chip giant is also working with Hawking on improving his communications - allowing the genius to communicate his ideas faster despite the motor neurone disease that has left him disabled .

Processing giant Intel is working on a solution to allow renowned physicist Steven Hawking to communicate faster . Hawking , 70 , has suffered from a degenerative motor neuron desease for half a century and is only able to speak using a computer that picks up voluntary twitches in his cheek muscle . Each twitch chooses a character from a screen in front of him , but as his condition has worsened , his speech has slowed and is currently down to one word per minute . Amid fears that he may lose the ability to communicate completely , Intel believes it has made a breakthrough which could could help the scientist reach five or even ten words per minute . Intel 's chief technology officer Justin Rattner wants to make use of other areas of Hawking 's face where he has limited motion , using the company 's processing technology . Rattner said : `` Up to now , these technologies did n't work well enough to satisfy someone like Stephen , who wants to produce a lot of information . `` We 've built a new , character-driven interface in modern terms that includes a better word predictor . '' The company , which has been helping Hawking since the 90s , is also exploring using facial recognition tech to create a new UI altogether . Let 's hope its efforts prove fruitful .

It may only be shipping to China for now ( actually three months from now ) but Lenovo 's new K900 smartphone is worth taking a look at . Announced during CES 2013 , the company 's new flagship phone sports a 5.5-inch IPS display and a 6.9mm side view . 6.9mm ? Seems there was another phone announced today with just that profile . What sets the Android-running K900 apart from its preceding smartphone is its processor : it will be packed Intel 's new Z2580 dual-core chip aimed at forthcoming handsets . The screen stands a solid 1080p and 440-plus pixels , allowing Lenovo to stake the claim that has the first IPS display of its size with the Full HD res . The phone 's a mesh of stainless steel alloy and polycarbonate material , creating a Unibody bod that 's as strong and sharp as appears . For the pocket conscious , Lenovo said the rear 13MP camera and sensor stay within the shell of the phone - no protruding bump here . The camera also comes with a F1.8 focal length lens , meaning users can take clear , flash-less photos . On the front side of things , Lenovo 's stretched out that camera to an 88-degree angle , the `` widest available '' for a phone 's front camera . And to look after Intel 's new chip ( of which full specs are n't yet public ) , it 's coated the screen in Gorilla Glass 2 for protection . Lenovo did n't announce pricing , but we hope we see some iteration of this phone make it out of China before long . It sounds like it could really hold its own .

Intel led its CES 2013 press conference with the debut of Bay Trail , the next-generation 22nm quad-core Atom tablet platform . It has more than double the computing performance of the existing Medfield Atom Processor Z2760 platform , but it wo n't appear in devices until late in the year and will usher in designs as thin as 8mm . Among the other announcements was a new smartphone platform for emerging markets plus details of thinner and lighter Ultrabooks . The announcements were outlined by Mike Bell , vice president and general manager of the Mobile and Communications Group , and Kirk Skaugen , vice president and general manager of the PC Client Group at Intel . Crucially , Skaugen announced that not only would wireless display and touch be a staple of the next-generation Ultrabook platform ( alongside the next-generation Intel Core chips ) but he also said there would be a new set of low-voltage current-generation Intel Core processors set at a mind-blowingly low 7W , having previously said it would have parts at around 10W . Intel is clearly set on destroying any chance of ARM processors getting into the serious Windows market because of their low power advantage . After having previously had ARM-based Windows RT on its Yoga 11 , Lenovo has now turned to these new Intel chips for its Yoga 11S . It 's a clear demonstration that the strategy over Windows RT has n't worked , either for Microsoft or its partners . Intel also wants to attack ARM in phones as well , of course , and it debuted its previously-leaked Lexington Atom platform which is designed to target the cheaper smartphone segment – Intel quoted analyst stats which suggest sales of 500 million units by 2015 . Acer was one of the manufacturers outed by Intel as a launch partner . It 's still to Intel 's detriment that it has n't managed to get too many big name phone partners involved , though Motorola has previously pledged support for Intel chips , of course . `` The addition of the low-power Atom platform further rounds out our expanding portfolio of smartphone offerings , '' said Bell . Emerging markets are where phones featuring this chip will mostly be sold . But the feature spec of the Z2420 platform is anything but low end with speeds of 1.2 GHz , hyper-threading , 1080p hardware-accelerated encode/decode , and support for up to two cameras with burst mode . The platform also includes the Intel XMM 6265 HSPA+ modem with dual-SIM capability . There will also be another Z2580 platform targeted at performance phones – it 's dual-core , but will offer twice the performance of the existing Z2460 . Intel also talked up its so-called 4th generation Intel Core processor family , promising to deliver up to 9 hours of continuous battery life . To demonstrate the impact of the 4th generation Intel Core processor family , Skaugen showed a new form factor Ultrabook detachable reference design ( codenamed `` North Cape '' ) that converts into a 10mm tablet and can run on battery for up to 13 hours while docked .

This year 's installment of the Consumer Electronics Show is right around the corner , but one thing we 're not likely to see come next week is a web TV platform from Intel . That 's according to a report from the Wall Street Journal claiming that the company has hit a snag in forging licensing agreements with media companies to provide content for its own internet-based TV service . According to the Journal 's sources , such a service ( and associated set-top box ) probably wo n't come until mid-year at the earliest and could even be delayed until the fourth quarter of 2013 . Intel had hoped to launch its own virtual cable business by the end of 2012 , but pesky content agreement hold ups seem to have delayed its plans to some amorphous future date . Intel is clearly arming itself for a serious web TV push despite the timing hiccups and reported obstacles from media providers . The company formed Intel Media in 2011 to focus on its TV exploits . Media is headed by Erik Huggers , formerly of the BBC , who helped kick off iPlayer . When asked about its web TV designs , Intel played coy regarding its plans . `` Intel Media is a new consumer-facing entertainment division of Intel focused on exploring new ways to access , interact with and share the latest in digital entertainment , '' Dan Snyder , PR manager at Intel , told TechRadar in an email . `` But we 're not prepared to share any future product plans at this time . '' According to a report from Forbes , Intel is prepping a small beta test of a set-top box for March . A report from over the weekend also has Intel scheming a localized U.S. cable service introduction to overcome the inflexibility it 's running into with a national roll-out . Despite the sweat its pouring into developing a solid groundwork for future media streaming , Intel faces an uphill battle when it comes to content providers . Media distributors are notoriously skittish when it comes to striking deals with web TV providers , afraid the unconventional set-top option would unsettle relationships with traditional cable companies . What 's more , Intel reportedly wants to give customers the choice to subscribe to individual channels that are n't part of the channel bundles currently served by content providers . A television executive told the Journal last month that such a move would require significantly higher fees than TV companies currently collect , a charge that would likely get passed onto customers . However , Intel has apparently already forged at least one content deal , though it 's staying mum on what company it 's partnered with . Despite its TV delays , Intel should have plenty to show at CES , most notably rumored all-new PC and mobile device chip sets . We can wait on its web TV ambitions , especially if more time means getting the service right .

Discussed briefly at CES 2013 , Intel 's Clover Trail+ dual-core processor ( Z2580 ) was revealed as the next step in the company 's Atom smartphone chips . A direct successor to the 32nm Medfield line of processors , the Clover Trail+ adds a second CPU core to the chip , improving graphics and performance along the way . The Clover Trail+ will be released as three new SKUs - the 2.0GHz Z2580 , the 1.6GHz Z2560 , and the 1.2GHz Z2520 . Each of the chips will also include two PowerVR SGX 544MP2 GPUs , and combined with the above benchmarks , should equate to more competitive performance , though the battery life still wo n't be as impressive as some smaller processors . The upgrades the Clover Trail+ presents are n't just limited to performance , as it also allows for more hardware improvements . The latest Atom chips will include support for two cameras , with the primary lens able to capture up to 16MP images , and the second camera supported up to 2MP . Shooting in HDR will also be slightly better with the new Clover Trail+ , as blur and ghosting will be reduced thanks to almost entirely re-written firmware . That same new firmware also adds the ability to select headshots from multiple takes of the same photo so you can create single images where everyone is more photogenic . The GPU will provide support for screen resolution up to 1920 x 1200 , which should bolster support for Intel 's chip in new tablets , as well as smartphones . Even though Intel has also updated the silicon in the chips to XMM 6360 , which provides HSPA+ antenna capabilities , the company still has n't made the jump to LTE-friendly silicon . The XMM 6360 includes a pentaband transceiver , and features 42Mbps DC-HSPA+ support , as well as 11.5 Mbps HSUPA support . Intel did promise actual LTE support by the end of 2013 via its Bay Trail processors , but those are n't expected until the holiday season . While the Lenovo IdeaPhone K900 and Motorola Razr i are already on board to support the new Intel processors , Intel is still lacking that major name to help it overtake rivals like Qualcom and ARM . The Clover Trail+ appears to be a strong effort from the manufacturer , but only time , and supporting smartphone and tablet companies , will tell if Intel can match up with more established chips from competitors .

Updated : Intel 's TV service wo n't be confined to just television screens , according to a report from CNET . The publication spoke to Huggers following Tuesday 's event and he said that the service will make its way to mobile devices , though it will take time to bring phones and tablets into the fold . Original story continues below ... An Intel-produced web TV service is in the works , Corporate Vice President at Intel Media Erik Huggers has confirmed , putting to bed rumors that such a product was indeed under development . The product wo n't have Intel branding , though it is as yet unnamed . `` We have been working for about a year now to set [ up a ] group called Intel Media , '' said Huggers during a D : Dive Into Media discussion Tuesday . The event , featuring discussions with leaders from around the industry , is hosted by AllThingsD . `` It 's a new division with new people - people from Apple , Netflix , and Google . And it 's devoted to developing an internet television platform . '' The service wo n't be without an Intel-powered set-top box , available directly from the firm and featuring a `` fantastic industrial design . '' Huggers said he expects consumers will be able to get their mitts on Intel 's television workings in 2013 . According to the VP , Intel 's service will offer live TV as well as on-demand , `` catch-up TV '' and apps . Users will have to pay for both the set-top and ability to watch TV online . Programming will come in bundles , much like what 's offered through major cable companies . Though Intel aims to make a better product , it wo n't necessarily be cheaper than what 's already available . In what will likely make some consumers squirm , a camera will call the set-top box home , watching users ' movements and noting viewing habits with the objective of providing a personalized viewing experience . Advertisers will naturally benefit from this arrangement , as well . When asked by a member of the media why even bother with the project , Huggers replied that it was part of creating a `` best '' TV experience for consumers . `` If we want to deliver the experience that we have in mind for the living room , there is no platform out there today that could deliver , '' he said . `` [ You ] need to control everything - the chip , the operating system , app layers , the sensors . That 's sort of the reason why we 're there . If there were platforms that could deliver exactly what we had in mind , we would work with that . '' Via AllThingsD

Saying the Nexus 7 has been a hot seller would be a disservice to the incredibly popular and often sold out Android tablet . Developed by Asus for Google , the Nexus 7 offered an impressive balance between power , size , and affordability other competitive tablets like the Kindle Fire HD and iPad Mini have n't been able to match . Rumors of another Nexus 7 from the dynamic duo have been making the rounds for some time , but all the while Asus has been busy working on similar competitive slates . Right after CES 2013 , Asus revealed the MeMo Pad , a 7-inch tablet with specs close to but not quite as impressive as those of the Nexus 7 . It was , however , built with affordability in mind . However , it looks as though the US $ 149 MeMo Pad was n't the only budget tablet Asus has been tinkering with , as a new and even more affordable-looking 7-incher has seemingly just been unearthed . Asus ' latest leaked tablet , the ME371MG , shares more in common with the MeMo Pad than it does the Nexus 7 , which is why some of the model number may sound similar ( the MeMo Pad was once known as the ME172V ) . Rather than the powerful Tegra3 processor found in the Nexus 7 , the ME371MG is said to use a single-core Intel Atom Z2420 processor which , according Tablets BG , clocks in between 1GHz and 2GHz . That factor alone is enough to bring the possible price of the new tablet down quite substantially from the 16GB Nexus 7 's US $ 199.99 price tag . Late last year , reports of a US $ 99 Nexus 7 tablet were making the rounds , and it 's entirely possible those rumors were actually foreshadowing the arrival of the ME371MG rather than a cheaper Google-backed tablet . This newly uncovered tab is also said to feature 1GB RAM , should include Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and come in 8GB , 16GB , and 32GB storage options - microSD expansion is also available . An IPS LCD display with 1280 x 800 pixels covers the front , while a 1.2MP camera is positioned there and a 3MP is placed on the back . Since Asus developed the Nexus 7 , it may seem counterintuitive to create a less powerful tablet that could still erode market share if priced right . However , even though the Nexus 7 has had no trouble moving off the shelves , a cheaper model may be more attractive to consumers without the expendable income to spend on the device . Asus is also prepping a MeMo Pad 10 to provide a counterpoint to the Nexus 10 ( developed by Samsung ) , which too shares a similar model number ( ME301T ) to this Intel-powered machine . Just where the ME371MG fits into the grand scheme remains to be seen , but for now it appears as if Asus is looking to capitalize on the budget market wholeheartedly . TechRadar asked Asus for more on this new tablet , and will update this story if the company feels like sharing . Via SlashGear

Mercedes has previewed the interior of its new S-Class luxury car . And it 's dominated by a pair of foot-wide LCD panels . The new limo also gets Google-enhanced sat nav , a digital perfume system and much , much more . In-car LCD screens have been gradually growing larger and larger in recent years . Tesla sticks a huge 17-inch panel in the Model S 's dash , for instance . But the big brands tend to be a bit more conservative about this kind of thing . So the new S-Class 's pair of ultra-wide 8:3 aspect , 12.3-inch LCD displays is something a bit special . One does the duties of the driver 's instruments while the other serves up the infotainment features , including navigation , entertainment , vehicle information , apps and more . Mercedes describes the screens as high definition but has n't divulged the precise resolution . As with all previous Mercedes cars with the COMAND system , the screens are controlled with a rotary dial . There 's no touch functionality . What there is , however , is an optional pair of COMAND monitors for the rear seats . While we 're on the subject of COMAND , it gets a major overhaul for the new S in the shape of 30 million new lines of code . Which is just as well , COMAND was beginning to feel a bit clunky . What 's more , increased processing power comes in the form of Intel 's Atom processor , which should help drive those big screens smoothly . The navigation , meanwhile , is enhanced by Google Maps technology and Merc 's excellent Drive Kit Plus app interface for iPhones makes another appearance . All very impressive . But wait , there 's more . The climate control system can be optionally augmented with Air Balance . It 's an air ionizer and filtering system that includes an active perfume system that subtly scents the cabin in carefully controlled cycles . S-Class buyers can choose between four scents , freeside , sports , downtown and nightlife . No , we are not making this up . Rounding out the headline interior tech is the obilgatory Bang and Olufsen sound rig cranking out a borderline offensive 1,500 watts of sonic fury . And remember , this is just the interior tech . Mercedes will soon be revealing details of the new model 's active safety systems and driver aids . Technological tour de force then ? It 's an overused phrase . But if anything qualifies , it 's got to be this extraordinary new Merc . The new S-Class is due to go on sale in May . Speeds and feeds are yet to be confirmed .

Apple has talked to Intel in an effort to have the semiconductor company manufacture its chips for future mobile devices , according to a report today . Currently , Apple has a contract with archrival and legal adversary Samsung to produce its mobile processors , including the Apple A6 CPU found in the iPhone 5 and the A6X that runs the iPad 4 . Just as much as Apple needs to ditch Samsung , this shift in system-on-a-chip manufacturers would also benefit Intel . Although Intel is the world 's largest and highest valued semiconductor company , it 's only now making a name for itself in the growing mobile processor market with smartphone manufacturers like ZTE . Apple and Intel have discussed system-on-a-chip manufacturing in the past year , according to a source who talked to Reuters , but no agreement has been reached . That means Samsung might still be in charge of making a potential Apple A7 processor that could be announced alongside the rumored redesigned iPad 5 . For its part , an Intel spokesperson told TechRadar that `` We do n't comment on rumors or speculation . '' If Intel were to make iPhone and iPad chips , it could lead to an additional $ 4.2 billion in revenue in 2015 , according to a figure Macquarie analyst Shawn Webster gave Reuters . That 's perfectly timed news for Intel . In addition to underestimating mobile in the past , the company has seen a decline in desktop and laptop processor demand , leading to a 19 percent decline in its stock over the last year . Also , Intel may be out as the designer of Mac processors soon . Apple , never sticking with one partner for too long it seems , is preparing to ditch Intel processors in its computers in favor of using an in-house system-on-a-chip designer . With many believing that Intel-less Macs are a case of not if , but when , this would be helpful to Intel and its goal of having its chips in one in 10 mobile devices by 2015 .

At the heart of ZTE 's next-generation smartphones will be Intel 's dual-core Atom Processor Z2580 processor , the Chinese company announced this week . This strategic partnership incorporates the fastest of the three Clover Traill+ CPUs announced at Mobile World Conference 2013 , with a clock speed of 2.0 GHz . That 's significantly speedier than the last-generation 1.6 GHz Intel Atom Z2460 processor that ZTE put into its first Intel smartphone , the Android-based ZTE Grand X IN . At the same time , ZTE said that next-generation Z2580-based phones will be able to `` deliver the same competitive battery life '' . `` The platform 's dual-core processor with Intel Hyper-Threading Technology provides double the compute performance and up to 3x graphics capabilities over the Intel Atom Z2460 processor , '' said ZTE in a press release . ZTE said that it will build on the success of the Grand X IN , but did n't reveal whether or not its next-generation Intel smartphones will be Android-powered and has yet to announce any other specifications . `` The Grand X IN was ZTE 's first flagship smartphone in Europe to feature Intel Inside , '' said ZTE Europe Mobile Devices General Manager Ao Wen . `` We 've launched it successfully across Europe in strong cooperation with Intel , and as a result have significantly increased our brand awareness in these important markets . '' Governments have been less than thrilled with the the Chinese manufacturer , but Intel seems smitten with its continued relationship with the company . `` ZTE is a fast growing global handset maker that strives to create products with features and capabilities that people care most about , '' said an Intel spokesperson to TechRadar . `` We share a similar goal in that our focus is on providing customers with compelling Intel technology options that ultimately translate into great products and user experiences . '' With the exception of the Grand X IN , ZTE has been using other semiconductor chipset makers for phones like the ZTE Grand S , ZTE Grand Memo and FireFox OS-running ZTE Open . However , Intel is taking steps to rival Qualcomm Snapdragon and ARM Cortex processors and make itself a bigger player in the mobile space . When TechRadar asked about the timing of its move , an Intel spokesperson said : `` There is a tremendous amount of innovation happening in the market segment and the landscape is continually evolving . `` Computing is also becoming more and more prevalent in smartphones and we see this as a natural extension of Intel technology . We see tremendous opportunity ahead . ''

Intel 's new breed of Haswell processors will headline a new range of MacBook Pro laptops at next month 's Apple 's WWDC 2013 conference next month , according to one noted analyst . Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities , whose track record is better than most , thinks the new models will take the stage at the Moscone Center , where Apple is also expected to showcase the next version of Mac OS X . According to Kuo , there 'll be no major design overhauls aside from the inclusion of Intel 's new processors , while the optical drive is also set to remain within the standard non-Retina Display MacBook Pro line . Last year the company launched 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display models , but ditched the optical drive to save space . In a note to investors , Kuo also poured cold water on speculation suggesting Apple is ready to bring the Retina Display tech to its super-slim MacBook Air line . Intel is officially launching the super-efficient Haswell family of chips on June 3 . Haswell will replace the current Ivy Bridge generation , with Apple 's WWDC event taking place exactly a week later . Also on the agenda for the annual developers conference is the first look at iOS 7 , which has the potential to be the most interesting software release in a while , given predictions that major changes are afoot . Just this week the company sold all 5,000 tickets for the event in just two minutes . Not bad considering they were $ 1,599 a pop . Via AppleInsider Check out our WWDC 2013 wishlist :

Mark your calendars for 3,337,200,000,000,000 nanoseconds from now . That 's when we 'll see Intel 's next line of Core processors . The clock has ticked down some since Intel first posted the counter on its social media networks today , but that does n't change the date of June 3 for the introduction of Core 's 4th generation , also known as Haswell . The date falls during the dates of Computex 2013 ( June 4 - June 8 in Taipai , Taiwan ) , and while we 've heard of this chip before , Intel should announce the chip 's availability . According to sources speaking with VR-Zone , several product launches - desktops , mobile , etc . - will be scattered throughout the days of Computex . Haswell is all about power efficiency and Intel intends to have the chip make it into everything from traditional desktop PCs to tablets . It 's a 22nm model and will come with four cores , and from what we 've seen the GPU performance is dramatically improved over earlier Core models . CPU is more mediocre , but we 'll have to wait and see how it shakes out in actual products . Intel has marked Haswell as the `` notebook re-invented '' processor , and with Computex knocking on the door , we should have an idea of where Intel wants the chip to take us .

Reports on Friday claimed Intel processors will power a new breed of affordable touchscreen laptops and tablet devices running both Microsoft and Google operating systems . CNET 's sources said the company is targeting the lower end of the market with both Windows 8 and Google Android touch-enabled devices . `` There are design wins for Android tablets at that $ 200 price point . Intel will be participating in that market this year , '' the source told CNET . The report backs up comments from Intel CEO Paul Otellini who , following the company 's quarterly earnings call this week , said the price of Intel Atom-based notebooks are to drop quite dramatically . `` If you look at touch-enabled Intel-based notebooks that are ultrathin using [ Atom ] processors . Those prices are going to be down to as low as $ 200 , '' he said . Earlier on Friday , Digitimes had claimed Intel was also promoting convertible Android-powered laptops running Intel Atom processors . It claimed Lenovo , Acer , Toshiba , Asus and HP were all planning to launch such devices later this year with a $ 500 `` sweetspot '' price point .

The latest version of Intel 's Thunderbolt input/output technology can transfer data at speeds of 20Gbps , in both directions , making it twice as fast as current versions of the tech . The technology was introduced in 2011 as a data transfer rival to USB 3.0 , allowing users to quickly transfer files between peripherals and computers , such as Apple 's MacBook line on which it features prominently . Presenting at the National Association of Broadcasters conference in Las Vegas , the company said the new tech will also support 4K video transfer and display when it starts to appear in products next year . The advanced speeds mean that 4K video could be played back on a connected display , while simultaneously sending the file to storage devices at 20Gbps . This could eventually encourage the likes of Apple , a big Thunderbolt supporter , to consider building iMacs , MacBooks or external displays compatible with the Ultra HD resolution . It also opens the door for more recent proponents of the tech , like HP , Asus and Lenovo to do the same . The new version of the technology will be also be compatible with current-generation Thunderbolt cables and connectors . Intel said it plans to ramp up full production in 2014 . During its presentation Intel said it was n't planning to stop at 20Gbps . By 2015 , it says Thunderbolt will be running at 50Gbps , five times faster than current 10Gbps Thunderbolt connectivity .

Razer rolled out two new laptops this week , the 14-inch Blade and a 17-inch refresh called the Blade Pro . The selling point of the company 's press event was the smaller Blade 's `` thinner than a dime '' profile , but CEO Min-Liang Tan was the real scene-stealer . Tan is approachable , a little quirky ( much like his spiky hair ) and genuinely seems to care about gaming . Razer 's tagline is `` for gamers , by gamers , '' and the Singapore-native earned props when he posted on Facebook last month that the company would honor bogus coupon codes despite the obvious revenue hit . Read more : Razer Blade Pro 17 We picked Tan 's brain following the laptops ' unveiling , wanting to know right off the bat his take on Intel 's 4th generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor , commonly called Haswell , the CPU humming in both machines . `` We have a great relationship with Intel , and they 've done a phenomenal job with integrated graphics , for example , '' Tan effused . `` I think the Haswell chip is a quantum leap over Ivy Bridge . I 'm super excited about it . I 'm looking forward to seeing what else we can work with them on . '' On the GPU end , Nvidia powers the Blades with GeForce GTX 765Ms . Intel and Nvidia are Razer 's `` traditional partners , '' Tan explained , and he appreciates the understanding both companies have for gaming . `` They understand gaming is important , '' he said . `` And they appreciate great design . '' The new Blade stacks no more than 0.66-inches high and weighs a sparse 4.135 pounds , yet still packs a snappy set of specs . `` It 's not enough to be the thinnest laptop - it has to run hardcore PC games , '' Tan said as he announced to notebook . Tan later said portable yet capable gaming laptops are a niche Razer wants to pioneer . `` We think it does n't exist today , '' he told us . `` It 's either really thick and heavy with a lot of performance , or it 's really thin and light without . We think this is a whole new category of what people want . To have the full performance of a gaming laptop [ and ] a MacBook Air kind of form factor . It does n't exist ... until today . And it 's only the beginning . `` This is definitely something we 're going to be investing in for a long time to come , '' Tan said of thinner and lighter devices . `` We 'll absolutely be continuing this , and pushing the limits for performance . '' With the 0.66-inch Blade , Razer can lay claim to the title of world 's thinnest gaming laptop . We were n't able to track down any slimmer 'tops in that league , though the MacBook Air clamps closed at 0.68-inches . Tan spoke repeatedly about Razer 's envelope-pushing ways , an attitude that helped bear the Blade 's hairline profile . `` We dare to take challenges , '' he laid out . `` Look at PCs today . When was the last time anyone was passionate about a PC ? It 's all been cheaper , more boring , thicker , stuff like that . `` We 've got some of the best engineers , and we challenge ourselves all the time . Today , we do n't really look at competitive products because we are our only benchmark . We 're pushing it day after day , and it 's fun . Life is short . ''

Apple MacBooks and Windows laptops with Intel 's new Haswell chips will benefit from a 50 per cent boost in battery life , the company has claimed . The new generation of processors , which will focus on lowering power consumption without compromising on performance , are set to be officially unveiled at next month 's Computex show in Taipei . According to Rani Borkar , corporate VP and GM of the Intel Architecture Group , the Haswell processors will offer a huge improvement over the current-gen Ivy Bridge chips when it comes to battery longevity . In a media briefing , reported by ComputerWorld , Borkar said that in standby or idle mode , the chips will be up to 20 times more efficient . Impressive stuff . The improvements are hugely important to Intel 's manufacturing partners and consumers who 're searching for that holy grail of all-day battery life from a laptop . Apple 's MacBook range may be among the first products to benefit from Intel 's new chips . Reports earlier this month suggested that new MacBook Pro laptops , featuring Haswell processors would be launched at WWDC on June 10 .

The power behind the Samsung GALAXY Note II is phenomenal when compared to handsets of today , but if you do a little bit of backwards-gazing it 's stunning to see how far computing has come in a mere 20 years . Why 20 years ? Well , it was in 1993 that the Pentium processor was born – the first chip that , arguably , made non-geeks interested in computing technology . Going back even further , though , Intel actually first created chip history over 40 years ago , with the arrival of the first ever single processor . Yes , we all love to shout ( quite rightly ) about the quad-core processor which powers the GALAXY Note II , but let 's not forget that it was the humble Intel 4004 that kick-started this evolution – placing all the bits that made a computer , well , compute on to a single piece of silicone . Hip to be a chip Skip 20 years and Intel offered up the idea that having Intel Inside your devices was a good thing . Before it created the Pentium brand , no one except die-hard enthusiasts knew about the chips that powered their computers , but Intel managed to make processors , dare we say it , cool . The first Pentium chip , the P5 – it was given the name Pentium as it was the fifth generation of processor , with `` pente '' being the Greek word for five – was available in a whopping 60MHz or 66MHz and had 3.1 million transistors powering the thing . Compare this to the Note II 's chipset , which runs at 1.4GHz , and you can start to see how far we have come . Cheaper chips Given that Moore 's Law predicts that computer processors double every two years , by 1998 Pentium were now clocking a ( at the time ) whopping 450MHz . Intel began offering a cheaper version of the chip , the Celeron , and a higher-end version , the Xeon . The advent of low-powered chips meant that smaller devices such as phones could begin to have features that were computer-like , such as powering the many apps – essentially mini computer programmes – that can be found on the GALAXY Note II . ARMs race Alongside Intel 's push for computing power , British company ARM was creating its own architecture for mobile chips . Now in 95 per cent of all mobile phones , Arm architecture can be found in many a device – it 's in the Note II for starters – with the technology used by the major semi-conductor makers Samsung , Qualcomm and nVidia . Why ARM ? Well , it 's low-powered , uses fewer transistors and generally turns the latest portable devices into a computational whiz kid . All systems go Taking Intel 's original idea of putting all of the computers thinking processes on to one chip , this eventually advanced to what we know today as a System on Chip ( SoC ) processor . And it is a quad-core variant of this chip that makes the GALAXY Note II tick . All System on Chip ( SoC ) means is that the chip has all the components it needs on a single chip to control and power a device . To put it into context : one of these chips has the same computing power as an entire desktop computer from a decade ago . And that is what is powering the Note II – it 's a mini computer in your pocket , complete with all of that S Pen loveliness . Take Note And this leads us to the Note II . Just how much power is packed into the device ? Well , if you compare the processor to what was around 20 years ago , the results will astound . If you just compare Hz ( how many cycles a second a processor responds ) , then the P5 's 60Mhz is some 25 times less powerful than the GALAXY Note II 's 1.6GHz processor of today . But this does n't take into account that the processor is quad-core so theoretically the Note II has a processor around 100 times more powerful than what was around just 20 years ago .
The architecture behind the Intel Silvermont system-on-a-chip could help the semiconductor company take on the mobile CPU space currently dominated by ARM processors . That 's because this 22-nanometer successor to the Saltwell microprocessor is being rebuilt with mobile technology in mind , specifically power-critical smartphones and tablets . Intel estimates that Silvermont will be able to provide about three times the peak performance as Atom processors like the Z2580 . Alternatively , the new SoC will be able to achieve roughly the same performance as current-generation Atom processors at 5 times the lower power . Silvermont , the first Intel chip to employ the next-generation low-power microarchitecture , wo n't be the last , according to Dadi Perlmutter , Intel executive vice president and chief product officer . `` Early sampling of our 22nm SoCs , including 'Bay Trail ' and 'Avoton ' is already garnering positive feedback from our customers , '' said Perlmutter in a press release . `` Going forward , we will accelerate future generations of this low-power microarchitecture on a yearly cadence . '' Intel 's commitment to yearly refreshes of its mobile-focused technology is already in the planning stages . This includes a 14nm processor codenamed Airmont with a release date expected in 2014 . With Intel Silvermont promising architecture that delivers industry-leading performance-per-watt efficiency , the semiconductor company may finally be able to make headway with its Atom processors .

Intel is set to introduce its next-generation Atom processor , which will be the first redesign of the chip since it launched five years ago . May 6 is the day Intel is expected to announce the refresh , which will be targeting a range of products from low powered tablets to smartphones and PCs . The 22-nanometer Atom will follow Intel 's mainstream Core processors with a speedy graphics chip and superior design . It 's big news for Windows 8 tablets which currently struggle a little under the current Atom when it comes to multitasking . And the good news is that it will allegedly wo n't be any less generous when it comes to battery . The Silvermont micro-architecture of the new Atom will produce Merrifield processors for smartphones and Bay Trail processors for tablets . We also know that Intel is looking at Android for powering low-cost notebooks in the future , with upcoming laptops from the likes of Asus expected to run Android on Intel chips . Via Cnet

Heavy texters who are joined at the hip with their smartphones could see that figure of speech become more literal in the future , as Intel has suggested it is working on wearable devices . `` We 're looking at novel display devices , '' said Intel chief technology officer Justin Rattner at Bloomberg 's The Next Big Thing Summit this week . Rattner said that Intel is starting to build such devices internally and confirmed that it has experimental devices in the labs that could stream short messages like texts . `` Particularly if you think of how much texting goes on today , would n't it be nice if you could just glance at your wrist and see the message traffic ? '' `` [ This is ] as opposed to 'you have to pull out your phone and you have to be very public about it . ' '' Intel may be poised to take on the emerging wearable computing market , Rattner pointed out . `` [ It ] requires a complete rethink of how you design systems and how you program systems . '' `` One of the challenges we see , and something that we 're giving a lot of attention to - not surprisingly - is how does the silicon change if you 're going to wear technology . '' As the executive for the world 's No . 1 semiconductor company , he estimates that devices worn all day long will have to be 10 times more efficient than cell phones . `` That 's where we 're doing a lot of work . '' Intel already has up-and-running rivals in the wearable technology field . Google Glass , for example , has already released to developers in the form of Explorer Edition glasses . Even more closely linked to what Rattner is talking about , the Pebble Watch streams messages from phones , and Apple could dominate the space with a similar iWatch without even trying . But the first sign of Intel 's progress in this area comes from its next-generation chip technology , Merrifield , which incorporates sensors that understand environments to save battery life . This energy-efficient 22nm Silvermont chip could be the key to Intel gaining marketshare over its rivals who already have a foot/wristhold .

Despite the spotlight still very much remaining on Intel 's battery boosting `` Haswell '' CPU , a fresh leak suggests that the chipmaker may be putting raw power back on the menu before long . Intel could be set to launch its first 8-core CPU for desktops in the second half of next year , beginning with its 2014 Haswell-E enthusiast-grade chip , according to a report on VR-Zone . Haswell-E processors will apparently be built on the 22nm 2nd generation Hi-k process and will pack up to 20MB of L3 cache . The chip also looks set to feature Intel Turbo Boost 2 , in addition to support for DDR4 and 16 threads thanks to hyper-threading technology , all supported by Intel 's forthcoming Wellsburg motherboard chipset . The company is apparently looking to do away with the 4-core base model in favour of 6-core and 8-core versions of the CPU . In terms of raw power , it 's the biggest leap since Intel announced its first 6-core processor for desktops back in 2010 . The superfast chip could primarily deliver the goods for three types of users : powerhungry gamers , overclockers , and content creators in the video , photo and music fields .

Intel is aiming to give businesses hosting cloud applications a boost by launching a new series of solid state drives for data centres . Designed for read-intensive applications such as web hosting , cloud computing and data centre virtualisation , Intel is touting its new DC S3500 Series as a replacement for slower , traditional disk drives . Its latest SSDs combine 20nm Intel NAND Flash Memory technology with SATA 6Gb/s interface support to reach sequential read speeds of up to 500 MB/s and sequential write speeds of up to 450 MB/s . With faster access to data , web pages load quicker and applications benefit from nippier response times . Superior performance means SSDs have traditionally lied at the more expensive end of the scale . However , prices of flash memory have fallen in recent years , and Intel is selling the new DC S3500 series at a cost that removes barriers of entry to the technology for smaller businesses with lower storage requirements . It is offering two SSDs in capacities ranging from 80GB to 800GB , at a suggested retail price of $ 115 ( £73 ) and $ 979 ( £625 ) respectively . Moreover , Intel claims that its DC S3500 SSDs offer improved total cost of ownership over traditional hard disk as a result of reduced power consumption , more consistent performance , and smaller space requirements as less rack space is needed . Speed and consistent performance are important factors for companies looking to move into cloud computing , which stores data or software in a remote location so it can be easily accessed at any time over the internet . Data loss is also of high importance , and Intel has built data protection features into its new SSDs , including capacitors that provide a short period of backup power to the drive allowing it to finish operations in the event of a power loss , and 256-bit AES encryption for data protection .

Knock knock ! `` Who 's there ? '' The interrupting cow ! `` The interr- '' MOO ! That 's one of our favourite jokes , but if you do n't time it perfectly it is n't funny at all . Timing does n't just matter in comedy , though . It matters in technology too - and this week , AMD and Intel were given a right good moo-ing by Microsoft , Sony and the entire consumer electronics industry . The timing was n't brilliant - the chip firms were overshadowed by last week 's PS4 and Xbox One announcements and the usual rumours and leaks that turn up in the run-up to Apple 's WWDC and the E3 consumer electronics conference - but the tech was . Intel has its new , hotly anticipated Haswell chips , and AMD has unveiled the desktop processors formerly codenamed Richland . Intel 's Haswell processors are `` a new family of 22nm processors from Intel , still known as i3 , i5 and i7 inside PCs and on the shelf , '' Jeremy Laird explains . That 's great news if mobility matters , but it 's not so good if you 're a power-crazed desktop speed-fiend : `` what was a niggling doubt with previous processors has become screamingly obvious . Intel has done almost nothing to improve the desktop experience with Haswell . '' That 's the bad news . The good ? `` For mobile PCs , Haswell is all kinds of awesome , '' Laird says . `` You could even argue it 's the beginning of a new era of computing . '' That 's right : while the internet is still arguing over exactly how ugly the Xbox One is and whether the PS4 should block used games , Intel only went and unveiled A WHOLE NEW ERA OF COMPUTING . Hype ? Apparently not . Imagine `` laptops that can survive a week on a single charge . Touch devices that combine a true tablet form factor with the power of a desktop PC . A shark with frickin ' laser beams . '' Jeremy did n't write that last item , but he did write an incredibly detailed and useful explanation of why Haswell is so important , and what kind of devices it could lead to . He also wrote this : `` What we desperately need [ is ] for AMD to give Intel a kick up the behind in the shape of some faster CPUs . Of course , the good news is that Intel 's current tactic of mostly standing still is giving AMD a better chance of catching up . '' AMD is certainly trying to do just that . As Dan Grabham reports , AMD 's A4 , A6 , A8 and A10 processors are available `` up to 4.4GHz with 4MB of cache and up to 779 GFLOPS of compute power '' . We think we can all agree that that 's a lot of FLOPS . The processors promise 21 per cent improved performance over last year 's Trinity processors , and AMD 's figures for PC Mark 7 suggest an eight per cent performance increase compared to Trinity . The desktop processors are n't the only new processors in AMD 's portfolio . Last month we saw the launch of new mobile Richland processors plus Kabini chips for mainstream laptops and Temash for tablets and hybrids . As Jeremy Laird points out in his AMD A4-5000 APU review , the Kabini 's Jaguar cores are `` found in both Microsoft 's new Xbox One console and the PlayStation 4 from Sony . Yup , AMD 's Jaguar architecture is a very big deal . '' We 've spent many years drooling over megahertz , gigahertz and core counts , but processors have long since reached the point where pretty much everything is ridiculously quick . Rather than expend their energies on slightly faster speeds , Intel and AMD are now focusing their energies on improvements you 'll actually notice - and that means improving graphics performance and power consumption rather than sheer horsepower . `` Graphics performance is in many ways the final frontier of computing , '' Laird says . `` It 's also the last major differentiator between desktop PCs and mobile devices . '' `` The work Intel has done with both power consumption and integrated graphics is excellent for laptops and tablets , '' Laird says . `` It 's also very promising for a new generation of ultra-compact PCs , including Intel 's own NUC as well as set-top boxes , tiny gaming machines , PCs hanging off the back of monitors , you name it , Haswell is going to make it either possible or much better than before . '' There are already 50 Haswell powered 2-in-1 ultrabooks ready to launch , and we reckon there 'll be at least one interesting Haswell-related announcement on Monday too . If Tim Cook does n't show off Haswell-powered Macs during Monday 's WWDC keynote , we 'll be amazed .

HP will announce a new fanless tablet , that will run Intel 's Haswell processor , later this year . Speaking to Engadget , HP confirmed that it did indeed have a fanless tablet on stage at Computex 2013 , although it was not shown to the public . The tablet will include one of Intel 's recently launched Haswell processors and a full announcement is expected later this year . Could this mean that we 'll see Intel 's powerful core range of processors , working in an ultra slim HP tablet ? With Intel 's power efficient processor , we could see a new dawn in tablet battery life longevity . Responding to a downward trend in desktop PC sales , Intel has developed a range of processors that are power efficient and optimised for mobile computing . Including these processors into a fanless tablet requires some clever design , which most expected to be a few years away . We look forward to HP 's announcement . Via Engadget

Intel is preparing for the future by betting big on gesture and voice controls , biometrics , and other `` perceptual '' computing technologies , according to a report out Computex 2013 . Intel will invest $ 100 million ( about UK£64.9 million , AU $ 104 million ) over the next two to three years in companies that make breakthroughs in these areas , the Wall Street Journal learned at the Taiwanese trade show . No doubt the company hopes to ride the crest of a wave of such technologies dropping soon , the most recent example being Microsoft 's highly publicized Xbox One game console . `` The idea of the $ 100 million fund is you go find companies that have those kinds of innovative breakthroughs and help get them to work , '' said Intel 's Asia-Pacific Vice President Gregory Bryant . Other technologies Intel will focus on include imaging and emotion sensing , the WSJ reported . The site added that Intel is already working with a firm called Creative Technology on 3D cameras for PCs that will go on sale this year , as well as with other hardware manufacturers on getting depth-sensing 3D cameras built into devices . But Intel executives would n't mention any specific companies that will benefit from the $ 100 million fund , according to the WSJ . Last year Intel announced it was working with Nuance , makers of Dragon dictation and speech recognition software , on new software for Intel laptops .

The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 was announced this week to no one 's surprise . What is a bit shocking is that the tablet will shift to using an Intel Atom Clover Trail+ System-on-a-Chip . As the first Intel-powered Android tablet , the company 's 1.6GHz dual-core Atom Z2560 processor replaces the popular ARM Cortex-A9 found in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 . Intel , further moving in on ARM 's lucrative territory , is also supplying the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 LTE chip with a model-dependent XMM 7160 4G or XMM 6262 3G modem . All of this is good news for Intel . Although it 's the world 's largest semiconductor company , it has been slow to provide mobile solutions to tablet and smartphone manufacturers . This deal is one of many the company has lined up for its Atom Z2560 processor . The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 release date is this month , according to Samsung . The South Korean manufacturer also revealed the specs for its Intel-powered tablet , which measures 243.1 x 176.1 x 7.95mm . When it comes to onboard memory , the Tab 3 will come in two different sizes . The 16GB version will give users approximately 11GB of real space . The 32GB version has about 26.3GB of user memory , but all models can be expanded with an additional 64GB of microSD memory . Samsung seems quick to admit that system files do limit user memory after the heat it took over the diminished capacity of its Galaxy S4 smartphone . The Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 sticks with 1GB of RAM , 3MP and 1.3MP front and rear cameras , and USB 2.0 . However , it trumps the Tab 2 with Wi-Fi Direct , Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean . The smaller Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8-inch model was also announced by the company with a slightly slower 1.5 GHz dual-core processor . Intel informed TechRadar that it will not be powering Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 with its Atom System-on-a-Chip . To get on-the-spot news , app tips and the full lowdown on Samsung 's latest mobile announcements check out Samsung 's Your Mobile Life on TechRadar . However , on the upside , the device has more memory with 1.5GB of RAM and a higher resolution 5-megapixel rear camera . Just like the bigger Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 , this iPad mini-rivaling tablet has a June release date .
Intel has launched a handful of new processors at Computex 2013 in Taipei , with a focus on smartphones and tablets . First up , the Intel Atom Merrifield chip has been specifically designed for smartphones . The firm claims they will bring increased performance and prolonged battery life . The 22nm Merrifield processor also includes a sensor hub which will allow handsets to provide users with personalised services - although Intel did n't reveal what sensors this covers . While it sounds all well and good , we will have to wait until next year before manufacturers start shipping handsets with Merrifield inside . It 's not just smartphones that are getting some Intel loving : the company is also launching two new chips aimed at the growing tablet market . The first chip will appear in tablets later this year , and the 22nm quad-core Atom SoC ( aka Bay Trail-T ) is apparently capable of delivering more than double the graphical output than the current generation of processors . It supports both the Android and Windows 8.1 operating systems , and Intel claims it is capable of providing 8 hours of battery life and weeks of standby - although we 'll reserve judgement until we see it in action . Finally Intel has also shifted some of its focus onto the 4G market with its quad-core XMM 7160 chip , which takes the `` world 's smallest and lowest-power multi-mode LTE solution '' title - a bit of a mouthful , but well done Intel . There 's currently no word on when we 'll see the 4G chip hit tablets , but we 'll be keeping an eye out for products sporting Intel 's new offerings .

The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display laptop could get a new slimmer profile if it is refreshed at WWDC 2013 on June 10 , according to one analyst . The relatively reliable ( at least for an analyst ) Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities , said Apple will introduce a more streamlined design and upgrade the camera to full HD with its keynote address , a week from Monday . According to recent reports , the tweaks will likely join the addition of Intel 's new low-power , high performance Haswell processors , which were officially launched this weekend . In a research note to investors Kuo wrote : `` We expect the 13 '' Retina MacBook Pro will have a slightly slimmer form factor for increasing its portability . `` Also , we think the camera spec will be upgraded from HD to full HD . This will improve Facetime and video conference quality in the high resolution Retina display . '' Beyond new Retina MacBooks Kuo also said Apple is planning a refresh for the popular MacBook Air model . He told investors the ultra-portable notebook would be getting a dual-microphone to enable better FaceTime and VoIP call quality . Naturally , it would seem , Haswell processors would be included within that model also , but there 's been no recent word on a potential Retina Display . Via MacRumors Find out what else we 're hoping to see at WWDC 2013 in the video below :

Remember the Pocket PC , back in the days when that meant a PDA and pointing stick ? Ironically , those Pocket PC devices were based on ARM CPU cores . Yup , Intel made ARM chips back then . Today , of course , the idea of the Pocket PC seems pretty quaint . It 's all about iPhones and Galaxies and iOS and Android . But you know what ? I think the notion of a PC in your pocket is just about to become relevant again . That 's because Intel is finally going to give us a new Atom processor core . For clarity , Intel has rolled out all manner of Atom chips . Single-core , dual-core , models for netbooks , models for tablets and most recently models for phones . But the actual CPU cores used in all those chips has remained the same since the first Atom chip appeared in 2008 . At last , Intel is about to give us a new Atom core , codenamed Silvermont . The big news is the transition from in-order to out-of-order execution instruction . The short version of why that matters is that in-order architectures involve quite a bit of waiting around for instructions to execute in careful succession . Out-of-order chips can plow on and worry about tying everything together later . A gross oversimplification , but the key notion is that out-of-order chips do significantly more work every clock cycle . The shift to out-of-order alone should boost Silvermont 's per-clock-per-core performance by 30 per cent , maybe more . It 's a big deal . Indeed , so critical is out-of-order processing that ARM 's new Cortex A15 chip , as found in many of the latest tablet and smartphone chips , have gone out-of-order . Intel has tweaked Silvermont in various other ways , too , for additional performance . Net result ? Very probably an ultra-mobile x86 chip that delivers on that ancient Pocket PC promise . The impact of all this will be multi-pronged . First up , I 'm hoping it will mean cheap tablets running Windows 8 will be properly usable . Personally , I would n't fancy anything running Windows 8 on the existing Atom chips . They 're just too feeble . Then there 's Silvermont in a smartphone handset . Atom already compares pretty well to the best smartphone chips , so Silvermont is shaping up to absolutely blow them away . Frankly , Intel needs nothing less if it 's to break into the smartphone market . Being merely as good or a bit better is n't enough to wean everyone off their ARM addiction in the smartphone arena . So , Silvermont could give Intel the leg up it needs in smartphones . But it also reboots that age-old idea of device convergence . I 'm talking , here , about an end to lugging about phones , tablets and laptops , all the while you have a desktop PC at home or in the office . If you could pack proper desktop x86 performance into a handset , well , your only limitation becomes the screen size . Admittedly , the desire for a decent screen for certain tasks does mean that you 're going to need more than just a handset for the foreseeable future . But I certainly like the idea of picking up my production PC and popping it in my pocket when I walk out the door . OK , I 'm not sure that even Silvermont is quite on that level . But it might be surprisingly close and , like I said , it should make for cheap Windows 8 tablets that are decidedly decent to use . Sounds good to me .
Intel has announced its latest generation Core i3 , i5 and i7 processor , promising that they will offer `` the biggest improvement in battery life in Intel history '' compared to their predecessors . Like rival AMD , Intel believes that thin and light laptops will give way to hybrid Windows 8 devices that combine touch , keyboards and a convertible form factor that will see them either used as tablets or conventional laptops . Intel 's logic is that even larger laptops are moving towards thin and light designs , while there will be a bigger demand for touch PCs in future . Intel is calling these chips `` 4th generation '' and in Intel 's tick-tock parlance , this is a tock ( formerly codenamed Haswell ) that succeeds Ivy Bridge , which also had a 22nm manufacturing process . There are 1.4 billion transistors on the quad-core die , which measures 177mm2 . Comparing a 2012 Core i7-3667U ( 20W TDP ) laptop chip with a new generation i7-4650U ( 15W TDP ) , Intel cites up to three hours of extra battery life ( 6 vs 9.1 hours ) during HD video playback , and a two hour improvement ( 6.1 vs 8.3 hours ) in MobileMark 2012 . Standby is up from 4.5 days to 10-13 days . Obviously we should take these figures with a pinch of salt , but there should be some interesting improvements in test figures for laptops . Intel is also claiming a 2x improvement in the graphics capability of the new chip 's HD 5000 graphics cores vs the previous HD 4000 generation . Last month Intel has also announced two extra levels of graphics for more professional use , called Iris and Iris Pro , numbered as HD 5100 and HD 5200 respectively . We 'll have a review of the latest generation CPU in the coming days for you on TechRadar .
Intel is still offering Celeron and Pentium processors , but now it 's switching these low-budget chips to tablet-focused Atom architecture . Specifically , Intel plans to fill entry-level laptops and desktops with variants of Bay Trail , its Atom-based System on a Chip . Bay Trail , which is scheduled to appear in tablets this holiday season , fulfills Intel 's previous claim that the Silvermont technology behind the chip `` has a ton of flexibility . '' `` Because of the advancements and flexibility of the ... Silvermont microarchitecture , we can customize the Bay Trail feature sets and develop variants of Bay Trail , '' said Intel spokeswoman Kathy Gill , according to PC World . These computer-bound variants of Intel 's quad-core Bay Trail chips also fulfill the company 's goal of keeping prices low . `` Bay Trail [ will ] power a new crop of computing products at a variety of price points , '' said Gill . `` The goal is to offer our customers the broadest selection of form factors , features and experiences at a range of price points . '' Pentium and Celeron , available since 1993 and 1998 respectively , have previously used vanilla versions of Intel 's Core line of processors . The redesigned Atom-based chips , Bay Trail-M for mobile devices and Bay Trail-D for desktops , should appear under the Celeron and Pentium brands when Intel makes the switch .

Intel has decided it wo n't include facial recognition in its upcoming set-top box for now because it does n't work so well in low light conditions like , say , a lounge . Oh yeah , and it 's incredibly intrusive and no one seemed all that keen on the idea . Although Intel tried to spin the facial recognition tech as a feature that would recognise who was watching television so it could personalise show recommendations , it was largely assumed that the data would be used to offer targeted advertising . Questions were also raised about what else Intel might do with its knowledge of your personal TV habits , and whether we really want anyone watching us watch TV . The news of the early demise of the facial recognition feature comes by way of the Wall Street Journal , which spoke with Intel 's corporate VP Erik Huggers . Intel is n't abandoning the idea of a set top box - far from it . The company has a 350-strong team working on the service which mixes on-demand shows with live TV programming that you can control . It 's not completely ditching the facial recognition plan either - it is only on ice `` for now '' . With Google making big plays for your living room with its low-cost Chromecast stick and rumours of an Apple TV set still circling , the fight for your TV has only just begun .

Intel Haswell chips have been able to double the battery life of the newly launched MacBook Air , so the chip maker is moving on to releasing a version for fanless tablets and convertible laptops . The quiet state of fanless slates will be achieved through a 4.5W Haswell variant scheduled to be available `` in the coming months , '' according to Intel . Eliminating the hum of noisy fans during intensive processing is just one benefit to a 4.5W Haswell chip . The world 's No . 1 semiconductor company is also aiming to fit the new power-efficient processor into thinner devices without sacrificing CPU performance . Intel 's 6W Haswell CPUs , announced at Computex 2013 , are also being used for detachable and convertible hardware , but are more intensive and therefore will require fans for cooling . Intel would n't disclose a release date for its first Haswell 4.5W chips today , noting that the parts will be on the market later this year in limited volumes . The company has also held off revealing the processor 's specs and which manufacturers will be coming out with the most energy-efficient Haswell-equipped tablets to date . Be that as it may , HP has previous expressed interest in being one of the first device makers out the door with a fanless tablet using Haswell architecture . We had previously noted that including these 4th generation Core processors would `` require some clever design , '' and making them 4.5W so that they do n't need fan cooling should do the trick .

Intel 's 45 today : the Intel Corporation - Intel 's a portmanteau of Integrated Electronics , although it was nearly called Moore Noyce after its founders Gordon E Moore and Robert Noyce , a decision that was abandoned when they realised it sounded like `` more noise '' - was founded in 1968 . Today we think of Intel as a processor firm but it started off making memory , and while it marketed its first microprocessor in 1971 there was a period where its future appeared to be not in processors , but in digital watches . But Intel 's processors hit the big time with the arrival of the IBM PC , which turned out to be quite popular : the combination of Intel processors , PC-compatible hardware and Microsoft operating systems would dominate computing for three decades . It 's amazing how far we 've come , both in terms of engineering and what that engineering has enabled us to do . We 've gone from computers that were little more than glorified adding machines to astonishingly powerful devices of all shapes and sizes - and that has changed the world . Intel 's Gordon E Moore created Moore 's Law , the prediction that transistor counts on integrated circuits would double every two years , and we saw that prediction take effect not just in processing power but in storage capacities and camera megapixels too . The acceleration of technology took us from 8086 to 286 , 386 to 486 , 486 to Pentium and onto multi-core processors in the blink of an eye , and we 've long since passed the stage when PCs were n't powerful enough for the things we wanted them to do . That turned out to be something of a Pyrrhic victory for Intel , though : in recent years the battlefield has n't been about power , but portability . The tablet and smartphone , not the PC , have become many people 's primary computing devices . As Jeremy Laird wrote recently , `` the desktop CPU war is over ... it 's all about ultramobile . '' PC sales have been in the longest , steepest decline in the industry 's history , and in some emerging markets the PC is being bypassed altogether as people buy tablets as their first computers . Should that cast a cloud over the birthday celebrations ? We do n't think so . The PC market may be shrinking but it 's still pretty big and largely Intel-powered , and while Intel-powered tablets have n't quite set the world on fire we have high hopes for Haswell . Some of our happiest computing experiences had Intel inside ; here 's to many more .

While Samsung is clearly focused on the Android ecosystem at its core with the likes of the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Note 3 arriving this year , it has n't forgotten about the feature-smartphone hybrid Tizen . Samsung ditched its home-brew feature phone OS , Bada , a while back as it looked to merge its efforts with Intel to further develop the Tizen platform - although it 's all been pretty quiet on this front thus far . But Tizen 's back with a brand new rap - well a cash incentive anyway , as a huge prize pot of $ 4 million ( around £2.7 million , AU $ 4.3 million ) has been pooled by Samsung and Intel in a bid to attract app developers to the platform . There a various categories into which apps can be submittted , with the top prize in each `` game '' category totalling a healthy $ 200,000 ( around £135,000 , AU $ 218,000 ) , with two runners-up prizes of $ 100,000 ( around £67,000 , AU $ 109,000 ) and then a further three $ 40,000 ( around £27,000 , AU $ 43,000 ) cash pots to be had . Meanwhile developers who enter applications into the `` non-game '' categories will be jostling for a $ 120,000 ( £80,000 , AU $ 130,000 ) jackpot in each section , with runners-up prizes totalling $ 60,000 ( £40,000 , AU $ 65,000 ) and $ 20,000 ( £13,000 , AU $ 22,000 ) . To get on-the-spot news , app tips and the full lowdown on Samsung 's latest mobile announcements check out Samsung 's Your Mobile Life on TechRadar . Developers have until November 1 to submit their applications , but it wo n't be until quite some time after that until we find out if the cash incentives have done enough to get people on board and make Tizen an attractive proposition to consumers . The wait goes on . From Tizen via AndroidCentral

First the good news . Finally , belatedly , maybe even grudgingly Intel will unleash an eight-core desktop processor . So say the latest leaks on the interweb . The chip in question is known as Haswell-E. Yup , a derivation of the somewhat maligned ( in desktop terms ) new Haswell family of CPUs . Haswell has oodles to offer for mobile PCs . But news of Haswell-E is the first time we 've had much cause to celebrate the new architecture on the desktop . So what are the details ? Apart from having eight cores and 16 threads , it 's mostly speculation . It does look like memory support gets an upgrade to DDR4 and the LGA2011 socket gets a tweak , breaking backwards compatibility . But of the eight-core chip itself , it 's a bit early for details . That said , we 're all familiar with Haswell cores in general and they 're not hugely exciting . Nor do they seem terribly keen to clock higher than previous Intel cores . So the added performance over Intel 's existing six-core enthusiast Core i7 processors will be predominantly down to a 33 per cent increase in cores . Which is n't to be sniffed at . Now the bad news . It 's not coming until late 2014 . Of course , all this only serves to underline that the upcoming Ivy Bridge-E chips will stick at six cores . They 're due out in the third quarter of this years and we 're already a bit bummed out by the prospect of another six-core flagship chip from Intel . That 's because the CPU dies underpinning both the existing Sandy Bridge-E Core i7s and those upcoming Ivy Bridge-E 's actually contain eight cores . Intel just switches two of them off . The context here is the fact that Intel has had eight-core chips in servers since 2010 . Admittedly , the first eight-core models were massive beasts that would simply have been too pricey for desktop PCs . But like I said , the current flagship Core i7 six-core chips are actually have eight cores inside . It 's all rather frustrating , especially post-Haswell and the realisation that desktop CPU performance gains from the new LGA1150 socket are incremental at best . Of course , you can buy an eight-core Xeon chip like the E5-2687W and drop it into a desktop LGA2011 board . It will work . But it 's also currently priced at just under £1,500 . So it ; s not exactly value . OK , there are some cheaper eight-core Xeons , but they 're lower clocked and still typically priced north of £1,000 . You 're basically paying a workstation and server tax along with a charge for compatibility with multi-socket systems . No , what we really want is a proper desktop version of these eight-core chips . But that 's not coming until late next year and three generations in . Or is it ? From what I 've read , the Xeon version of the new Ivy Bridge-E enthusiast CPU will be available with up to 12 cores . So the desktop version will have no fewer than six cores disabled . Come Haswell-E and you can be fairly sure that eight-core chip will have a fistful of hidden cores you ca n't access . Indeed , it seems like there will actually be 14 cores inside Haswell-E . But on the desktop we 'll only be able to get at eight of them . Pretty rum , eh ? Liked this ? Check out Best CPU : 10 top processors reviewed and rated

Even before Intel ramps up production of its 22nm Bay Trail-based processors with Silvermont , the chip maker is already looking ahead to its line of new processors for 2014 , according to a report this week . The company 's next-generation tablet processors , Cherry Trail and Willow Trail , now have release windows , claims DigiTimes via Taiwan-based chip makers . The 14nm Cherry Trail is expected in the third quarter of 2014 , while the 14nm Willow Trail looks as if it 's going to follow soon after in the fourth quarter . Cherry Trail specs are said to feature Intel 's 14nm Airmont architecture and a clock speed of 2.7GHz with a Gen8 GPU . A few months later , tablets with Willow Trail are going to include Intel 's 14nm Goldmont architecture and a Gen9 GPU to support both Windows and Android operating systems , according to DigiTimes . Intel is also looking to make significant gains with smartphone systems-on-a-chip this year and into 2014 , according to the same report . The No . 1 semiconductor chip manufacturer is said to be prepping the 22nm Merrifield SoC for the end of 2013 . Merrifield should give next-generation smartphones an edge , which is rumored to be boosted by a 50 % performance increase and feature longer battery life over Intel 's current Clover Trail+ platform . Want `` moore ? '' Intel 's Moorefield platform is likely to improve upon those specs in the first half of 2014 and 14nm Morganfield will do the same in the first quarter of 2015 , according to Taiwanese sources .

Intel is the latest in a long line of tech companies to find out that television is a tangled web of rights and regulations , with reports suggesting that its grand web TV plans have been shelved until 2014 . Although it is known mainly for its silicon , Intel has its electronic eyes on the TV market , employing ex-BBC supremo Erik Huggers to lead a 300-strong team whose sole job it is to come up with a viable plan for television . We were meant to see the fruits of this in 2013 , with Intel announcing back in February that it was to release a set-top box service dubbed 'OnCue ' that would act like a cable provider in the US but all of the content coming through the web . The problem is the content - or lack of it . Reports now suggest that this has been put back to 2014 , with Intel now looking for a desirable partner to help remedy its content problems . So far the list , according to unnamed sources is : Amazon and Samsung . Amazon makes sense from a content point of view but the addition of Samsung does mean that maybe Intel is looking to partner up with a big TV manufacturer before something like an Apple television comes along with pretty much the same idea . Another content provider rumoured was Netflix but Variety has revealed that these discussions were never really taken seriously by Netflix . Considering its current popularity as a standalone app , it would be hard to think how joining up with Intel would benefit the streaming service . With Huggers on board , Intel does have some TV clout . He was part of the creation of iPlayer , which has proven to the world that on-demand TV through the web can work , it just needs a smattering of simplicity and good content to make it thrive . Currently Huggers may have the technology at Intel , but it is the content that is proving to be the biggest challenge of all . Via AllThingsD

Intel 's Atom processor was always a good idea . Shrink the power profile associated with the full-power x86 instruction to ultra-mobile proportions . Or rather , it was a good idea ahead of its time . In fairness , Intel probably had to get the Atom project rolling when it did , back in 2009 . That 's because mobile is such an epically important market . Intel not only had to be seen to be doing something , even if manufacturing technology was n't quite ready to do x86 justice in ultra-mobile form factors like phones and tablets . It also had to commit to mobile in the long run and give itself the best chance of succeeding . Ironically , that meant wheeling out a series of Atom chips which I 'm fairly sure the company knew were n't terribly compelling . But it was all part of the process of preparing both the market and its own design , engineering and manufacturing processes for the coming ultra-mobile uplift . Anyway , Intel has been showing off its latest and greatest Atom platform , codenamed Bay Trail , at the IDF conference in San Francisco and as the news is all good . Early benchmarks indicate that a quad-core Bay Trail system has CPU performance very close to AMD 's quad-core Jaguar-based chips . I happen to have been running a quad-core Jaguar-based thin and light system for several months now , so I 'm very familiar with the experience you can expect in Windows 8 . And it 's just dandy . OK , you would n't really want to encode 1080p video on the fly . But for day-to-day computing , it fits the good-enough definition just fine . But here 's the thing . Under heavy load , it 's thought Bay Trail consumes just one to two watts of power . Now making direct comparisons is very difficult . But it looks like an equivalent AMD Jaguar-based chip guzzles at least four times and maybe as much as ten times as much power . That matters because it means Intel will be able to drive true good-enough x86 computing into smaller form factors than ever before . Does that include smartphones ? The verdict is out on that question , unfortunately . Bay Trail is targeted at tablets , not smartphones . There will be an Atom platform known as Merrifield and based on the same new CPU cores found in Bay Trail . But it 's not yet clear just how much performance will be lost in that transition . Whatever , I 'm not too worried . For me , it 's step-by-step . Given me a proper x86 Windows experience in a 10-inch tablet convertible at the same low prices as the ARM-powered Android masses and I 'll be a very happy bunny indeed .

The Extreme Tuning Utility ( XTU ) just got a game-changing upgrade called AppTune and it could be one of the most important things to happen to PC overclocking in years . Intel 's XTU software is n't particularly well known , but it 's an incredibly powerful overclocking utility that gives you access to every part of your Intel system from within a Windows application . In other words , no BIOS tweaking necessary . Now , most of us casual overclockers will generally just nip into the BIOS at boot , push up the multipliers and very occasionally mess around with a few voltage settings . That 's all well and good , and can get you an easy , robust overclock on your processor . The problem is you 'll probably end up burning away your CPU at that overclocked frequency , whether you 're fragging folk Planetside or tapping out a shopping list in Notepad . Whether it 's shortening the lifespan of your desktop chip , making your system sound like a Harrier jump-jet or rapidly sucking juice from your notebook 's battery , none of these is a particularly efficient use of your chip . What AppTune offers is a dynamic , per-application overclock . That means you can set up your system to overclock the nuts off your processor when you really need it , and for those applications that do n't , you can drop it down . In fact , if you 're particularly power-conscious , you could even use it to underclock your system and save on juice . `` This is absolutely revolutionary , '' explained Dan Ragland , Senior Systems Engineer at Intel . `` I really believe this is a game-changer . It may take a while for this to settle in and people to get this , but you 're going to see this take off like wildfire . `` We showed you the tip of the iceberg – this is going to be huge . '' It 's not just the processor that Intel 's XTU has access to either . If you 're running Intel graphics you can tweak those too , plugging that overclock into your application profiles . You can also have access to the bells and whistles of whatever RAM you 've got installed in it . Now , you may be looking at the screenshots and thinking , `` that all looks rather complicated to me , '' but AppTune has that covered too . Intel has worked with overclocking maestros , HWBot [ hwbot.org ] , to introduce the XTU Zone into its website , and also to link the benchmarking component of XTU directly with that community . From the benchmark tab of XTU you can test your system , submit the results of your current profile and see how your system compares with others like yours , or indeed any other setup . The very cool thing though is that you can then download anyone else 's overclocking profile and import it . So , if someone 's got a really impressive graphics overclock you can add that in to an individual game 's overclocking profile . The Extreme Tuning Utility is already out there and the 4.2 version offers the AppTune in beta form if you choose to opt in via the software 's settings .

The latest Intel CPU is set to ship to partners before the end of the year and we 've seen it running . New ( ish ) Intel CEO Brian Krzanich – or BK as he 's known to the Intel engineers we spoke to – showed off the most advanced Intel silicon yet at his first Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) in charge . And not content with just flashing up a finished 14nm SoC chip , we also saw it running classic CPU benchmark Cinebench in a testing platform . The previous generation Haswell processors were the culmination of 11 years of hard work designing the tri-gate transistors in order to get down to 22nm . This was what Intel calls the 'tock ' - now we 're finally seeing the 'tick ' of the Haswell microarchitecture shrunk down to 14nm . `` This is it , folks , '' exclaimed Krzanich . `` 14nm is here , it 's working and we 'll be shipping by the end of this year . '' Kirk Skaugen , Intel VP , then went as far as to actually show a Broadwell SoC running in a testing platform with the CPU intensive Cinebench R11.5 benchmark . He would n't show us the final score of the four-thread processor , but demonstrated the power levels against an equivalent Haswell SoC running beside it . They were both Y-series parts , the lowest power variants of their generations , and where the Haswell Y part was running at around 6.8W fully loaded , the Broadwell SoC was hitting only 4.9W . `` I can show you the benefit of what 14nm is already delivering without a lot of tuning , '' said Skaugen . `` We 're seeing it comes to a 30 % power reduction at the same performance level just by moving from the Haswell to the Broadwell SoC . '' `` And we 're not done yet , '' explained Krzanich . `` That 's as far as we 've been able to test it . So 14nm is absolutely a reality , it 's absolutely coming to a PC near you and we 'll see it in product next year . '' If that sort of power reduction scales up to the desktop parts too , we should hopefully see some fantastic performance improvements when Broadwell arrives in our machines in the spring of 2014 . And with that reduction in die size , we 're hopeful we 'll get even more Iris Pro graphics love with the modular Gen 8 HD graphics .
Intel is banking on the 'new ' 2-in-1 convertible laptop category to arrest the slump in PC sales and turn the tide on the tablet . This year 's Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) is all about mobility , but it 's not just the new Intel Atom Bay Trail tablets that are stealing the show – Intel also wants hybrid laptop/tablet devices to capture the public 's consciousness . `` Think about a world where there 's really three kinds of categories in mobile computing , '' said Kirk Skaugen , Senior VP of Intel 's Client Group . `` There 's the standard tablets – 7,8 and 10-inch slates – and we have our traditional notebook families . What we 're doing now is saying we can create a new category that combines the best of a laptop and the best of a tablet in a single device . '' Now , it seems rather churlish to point out that actually 2-in-1 laptops have been around for years – I 've been carrying a touchscreen , flipscreen Acer notebook to IDF for since 2010 – but finally the ecosystem is catching up with what we actually want from such devices . Like the ultra-portables , there 's a minimum spec for these new 2-in-1 machines . First off they 've got to have a 10-inch , or larger , screen . `` Screen sizes that do n't compromise the productivity of a laptop , '' explains Skaugen . They will also ideally have an integrated keyboard design , though that 's not a deal-breaker in itself . What is though , is the operating system – it has to be a full OS . And Skaugen was quite specific about that : `` Not Windows RT – to give you the full x86 compatibility that the PC industry is known to love . '' Unlike the ultra-portables though , 2-in-1s are n't just designed to be the elite of laptops . Sure , there will be Haswell-based , Ultrabook-like 2-in-1s , but there will also be lower-end Bay Trail-powered options . `` These are n't just going to be premium devices , '' he continued `` You 'll see these 2-in-1 devices from $ 999 all the way down to $ 349 by the holidays . '' I asked Doug Fisher , VP of Intel 's Software and Services group if the 2-in-1s were being set up to arrest the decline of the PC market versus tablets . `` Absolutely , '' he answered . `` Some people want a tablet and we want to address that market . But there is a desire – and I fall right into that camp - I do like to have a tablet but I really need a creation device . `` I like both experiences , but I 'm starting to get to the point where I want to carry one device , but at this stage I 'm carrying multiple devices . So I really do look forward to having a tablet when I want it and a laptop when I need . '' The big trick though , especially with such a wide price range , is ensuring the lower-end does n't poison perception of the entire category . Intel is making sure there are minimum specs devices have to hit , such as a touch responsiveness of around 200ms , responsiveness out of sleep , boot times and full , nine-hour battery life . Intel is really hoping this refreshed , if not exactly new , category can give the PC market a much-needed shot in the arm . It points to a small research sample across the US and China which found 48 % of people buying a 2-in-1 device would have bought a 10-inch tablet if they were n't around . It 's a small sample , and tablet buyers are n't going away , but so long as they 're quality , desirable products , 2-in-1s could wrestle some market share back .
As promised , Intel demoed solid-state drive ( SSD ) overclocking on the first day of IDF 2013 in San Francisco , but sadly it 's little more than a lab experiment right now . Using a Clevo W740U laptop , Dan Ragland , Senior System Engineer showed off an unreleased version of the Extreme Tuning Utility ( XTU ) complete with the experimental SSD overclocking tab . In that new section is a pair of sliders allowing you to change the frequency of both the memory controller as well as two frequency levels for the NAND chips themselves . Ragland pushed the Intel SSD 's memory controller up from 400MHz to 625MHz and then ran the AS SSD benchmark to demonstrate the performance benefits . For the extra 225MHz overclock , we saw the SSD delivering around a 10 % performance boost . That was an overall benchmark score though , not covering the different workloads that SSDs perform . I asked whether that 10 % boost worked across the whole SSD range - whether it increased sequential read/write as well as random 4K speeds - but Ragland was a little cagey in his response . `` I gave you a snapshot of one benchmark , it varies , '' he said . `` There are some areas where you 'll see a whole smattering . To be honest , we 're just playing with it in the labs , we 're still in the experimental stage at the moment . '' I followed up with a spokesperson from the NAND Solutions Group ( NSG ) about whether the performance benefits could be worth the risk to your data . `` Any risks you take with your data in overclocking the memory controller has to be monitored , '' he explained . `` But we have those monitors . '' There are system monitors embedded in the SSD controller tech that measures error rates across the NAND memory chips . If the undetectable bit error rates ( UBER ) start rising then you 'll be incurring elevated stress levels on the NAND – at that point you 're going to want to start winding your overclock back in . Whether those same system monitors will work when overclocking the NAND chips though is still unclear . But as the representative from NSG explained : `` Controller overclocking is what you want – the intelligence is in the firmware and you do n't want to stress the NAND so much . '' But it 's still an intriguing new arena for overclocking . And with newer memory controllers , especially the multi-core variants Intel is working on , we could see some genuinely tangible performance benefits from SSD overclocking . Well , so long as the risks to your data are pretty much zero anyways ...

Intel and Google unveiled a new line of Chromebooks today at IDF 2013 , and it sounds like they 'll pack something of a punch . With the Haswell chip on board , the next-generation Chromebooks offer better battery life and improved performance , according to Intel . The Haswell microarchitecture uses less power , which according to a Google blog post effectively doubles the new Chromebooks ' battery life . This generation of Chrome-based computers is pouring in from a variety of manufacturers , with Chromebooks coming from Acer , HP , and Toshiba , with Asus putting out a Chromebox . Specific hardware details were n't squeezed out , but the devices should be available in the coming months . Unlike Acer and HP , Toshiba and Asus are new to Chrome hardware manufacturing . With those two in the mix , six top laptop manufacturers will soon be offering Chrome-based hardware , Google noted . The search company offered descriptions for each new entry , as well . The Acer Chromebook is `` light and portable , '' for example , while the HP Chromebook 14 has a large display and comes in a variety of colors . The Toshiba Chromebook is versatile and portable , Google effused , while the Asus Chromebox is `` suitable anywhere you need a computer , '' whatever that means . Google also offered some figures from NPD . According to the research firm Chromebooks represent 20 % to 25 % of all computers that are $ 300 ( about £189 , AU $ 321 ) or less . In addition , over 5,000 schools , representing more than a fifth of all U.S. school districts , have adopted Chromebooks for their students . Google 's hub pages for the new Acer Chromebook and the HP Chromebook 14 say that the laptops will be available in select countries . HP revealed in a separate announcement that it expects to ship the Chromebook 14 for $ 299 ( about £188 , AU $ 320 ) before the holidays . Likewise , Acer 's new Chromebook will launch before the holidays , the company told TechRadar , though there 's no pricing info yet . TechRadar asked Asus , Toshiba and Google for more about the other new Chromebooks ' availability , and we 'll update this story when we hear back .
Power is a relative term when you 've got a 6W Haswell-generation Intel Core architecture humming away inside your tablet . It 's all at once low-power and high-powered . Amid all the benchmarking fun in Santa Clara with Intel 's new Bay Trail Atom tablet processor at the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) , the engineers casually brought out this slim , unassuming black tablet , the Sony Vaio Tap 11 . We 've already covered the top-end , silly-money version of the Sony Tap 11 with its i7 CPU and 2,880 x 1,600 display . This is a much more sensible option that could nevertheless give the Surface Pro a good run for its money . It 's still got the same chassis and dockable keyboard , which gives it a slimline design and a weight equivalent to that of the latest iPad , but it 's running a 1080p screen and that pseudo 6W Haswell CPU , the Intel Core i5-4210Y . But what do we mean by pseudo 6W ? Well , it all comes down to what Intel calls the Scenario Design Point ( SDP ) versus the more standard Thermal Design Point ( TDP ) . The SDP is the lowest level of cooling a manufacturer needs to fit into their devices to run a given processor - but it also means the CPU will run at a slower speed . Thermal Design Power ( TDP ) , refers to the maximum amount of power that a PC 's cooling system needs to dissipate . The actual TDP of the i5-4210Y , running at its stated 1.5GHz is 11.5W . That 's still lower than the 13W of the previous lowest Ivy Bridge generation , so kudos for that . And if it allows for some seriously exciting tablets like this Sony Tap 11 , then we 're all for it . Hopefully the lower-res screen and low-power CPU can mean we get a little more than the touted six hours of battery life the top-end Sony Tap 11 is sporting too . Intel still would n't be drawn on exactly when we 'd see this new tablet with the low-power Haswell , or how much it would be . But given that they 're running Windows 8 rather than waiting for Windows 8.1 , we 'd guess they 're ready right now , just waiting for Sony to give them the green light to ship . And the question of cost ? Well , all Intel would say was that they would be `` significantly under $ 1,000 . It 's not going to kill you ... '' Obviously it depends on Intel 's definition of `` significantly '' , so that could be anywhere from $ 20 to $ 200 , but this is shaping up to be an impressive tablet .
Twice the speed of the previous generation - that 's the familiar cry from Intel regarding its latest Atom processor , codenamed Bay Trail . It 's the big thing coming out of this year 's mobile-focused Intel Developer Forum and so we found ourselves in Intel 's Santa Clara offices with a reference design tablet to play with . And , to be fair , Intel might have been a little conservative with this `` twice the speed '' business . The tablet I had was a reference design device , with a lovely - though occasionally flickery - 2,560 x 1,440 screen . That 's the same resolution as my 27-inch IPS screen back home and it looked great on a 10-inch tablet screen . It was also a Windows 8.1 machine , which meant I could grab any of my usual benchmarking suite and really punish the new Atom CPU architecture . Except it was n't really punished . With a proper 22nm quad-core design and the switch to an out-of-order CPU setup , it 's much more in line with the Core processors we 've been used to on the desktop and in modern Intel laptops . And so it 's far more capable of dealing with the sort of CPU benchmarks that made the previous Clover Trail chips weep silicon tears . When we 're talking single-threaded performance , Intel 's performance claims hold true . The Atom Z3770 chip that was in my reference tablet was running at a solid 1.46GHz - that 's a good chunk slower than the 1.8GHz of the Atom Z2760 of the previous generation . And yet I 'm still seeing it delivering twice the performance in my Cinebench R11.5 benchmark . But that 's the single-threaded test and the chip I 'm running is a bone fide quad-core chip as opposed to the dual-core , HyperThreaded Z2760 . And when we take another two proper cores into the equation we 're looking at nearly triple the performance in the multi-threaded Cinebench test . That 's also backed up by my X264 HD video encoding test too . Both those benchmarks are serious , CPU-intensive beasts and it was impressive to see a tablet chip running them to that extent . In fact the 4W Atom Z3770 is on par with the performance of the 15W quad-core AMD Kabini A4-5000 we 've seen in laptops . You know , those same Kabini cores that make up both the PS4 and Xbox One 's processor component . I also saw some impressive power testing results too . Compared with a Bay Trail tablet with a lower-res screen and only two physical cores , the Bay Trail reference design is capable of running the same workloads , be they CPU tests or 3D gaming , quicker but at the same sort of power levels . And that 's counting both CPU and GPU parts using that hefty 2,560 x 1,440 display . But what about other tablets ? The WebXPRT benchmark tests general tablet usage via different HTML5 and JavaScript-based workloads . Compared with the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 in the Nexus 7 , and the Apple A6X chip in the 4th gen iPad , the Bay Trail Atom Z3770 offers around 200 % extra performance . That all bodes pretty well for Intel 's latest tablet architecture . But , to be fair , the problem for Intel 's tablet program has never been the performance . Intel has generally always been able to claim performance leads over the silicon competition . The big issue then is the fact that Intel is tying Bay Trail in with Windows , and the market for Windows tablets is a lot smaller than for Android devices . Despite being announced here in San Francisco this week , Bay Trail is going to make its first appearance once Windows 8.1 has finally been released . According to Intel sources it should be the same day . Where the latest Atom has a chance though is in the fact that it will run Android too , although not at launch . It 's looking like it 's going to be a little after the Windows launch for Android-based Bay Trail tablets . Intel says it knows how to work its silicon for Windows , but Android takes a little longer to get right . Still , it 's a shame Intel has chosen to focus Bay Trail on the failing Windows tablet ecosystem when it 's actually got a really impressive architecture for the Android tablet market .
Intel has officially launched its Intel Atom Z3000 series of procesors , aimed squarely at the tablet and low-power computing market . But the question remains – can it really break into a segment where ARM is dominant and Intel is just a tiny player ? The corporation is holding the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) this week in San Francisco , where TechRadar is in attendance . The new 22nm silicon supports Windows 8 ( including Windows 8.1 , of course ) as well as Android . But Intel needs Bay Trail to actually appear in a decent number of tablets , and that 's what we 're hoping to see this week at IDF . The Z3700 Series are quad-core SoCs for Windows and Android , while the dual-core Z3600 series are for Android-only devices . All the new parts feature Silvermont cores as well as integrated Intel HD graphics . Both will butt up against AMD 's Jaguar-based Kabini APUs . Intel is claiming But there are concerns over the performance of Bay Trail – early experiences of the Bay Trail-toting 8-inch Toshiba Encore tablet at IFA 2013 were n't brilliant , while Intel admitted in its conference call to the press that there would only be 32-bit solutions for Windows available this side of Christmas , with the performance boost of 64-bit to follow in the first part of 2014 . In a briefing with TechRadar Chris Walker , Intel 's head of tablets explained : `` Basically it comes down to what the market needs - the priority was to deliver a 32-bit [ experience ] for holiday [ Christmas ] and to deliver a full 64-bit experience in Q1 '' Intel says this will fulfil consumer orientated pricing for the holiday season . `` Bay Trail is our first ground up reengineering of Atom , the whole package has been redesigned for tablets . '' In terms of battery life on a tablet , Intel is talking about 8 plus hours of video and web playback on both Windows 8.1 and Android from launch , while Intel is also talking up LTE performance , too . Intel has favoured multi-core over multi-threading with Atom . Principal engineer Rajesh Patel explained why . `` The key decision for us was to accelerate single thread performance because most apps use single thread . `` We 've been waiting for multi-threading to come along but it 's taking some time . Multi-threading is here to stay in the mobility space , but it 's come in the form of multi-cores . For multi-threaded apps we can deliver the [ same ] performance at lower power . '' Toshiba 's Encore features the Atom Z3770 clocked at 1.5GHz but at IFA last week ExtremeTech found Windows 8.1 slow on the device . Toshiba said the tablet needed further optimisation , but as the site points out , the HD 4000 graphics is a `` fairly well-known entity '' . Intel 's Francois Piednoel did tweet a healthy 1.47 pts score in Cinebench 11.5 – that backs up Intel 's claim that Bay Trail has twice the performance of the previous Clover Trail Atom . Intel also claims a 3x improvement in graphics power . As for its market position , Bay Trail will obviously slot in underneath the Haswell-generation Core i3 , i5 and i7 . `` Haswell plays at $ 599 and above , Bay Trail will play at $ 199 and above , '' says Walker . `` This also extends to [ business ] . We 're ready for business with Windows in a way that no other device can do . These play together . Atom comes in as a great solution . '' `` You still need a Core for an Ultrabook . For 2 in 1 devices ( like convertibles ) we feel it 's about Core for more performance headroom and Atom for mobility . ''

If yes , the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is the product you want to consider . The chipset is n't as powerful , the cameras are n't as impressive and the screen is n't as beautiful ... but it 's around half the price , and all of its specs are still quite impressive for a slate at this price . It 's a remarkably good product considering how much you 're spending on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite . It is n't particularly smaller than the Galaxy Tab S6 - and ironically , it 's actually heavier too - but if you do n't want to spend top-dollar you may love this .

And the Amazon-centric interface used – which won ’ t appeal to everyone – ensure you ’ re never far from Amazon Prime content . That ’ s not to say you shouldn ’ t buy the Amazon Fire HD 10 ( 2019 ) if you ’ re not an Amazon Prime member . This is a durable , affordable slate with reasonable specs for the money , so it ’ s also a strong choice for anyone on a tight budget . But some of the options above in this list will likely be a better fit if money is no object .

It also delivers surprisingly strong gaming performance , with a decent amount of power for the money . The speakers aren ’ t great and the cameras are awful , but tablets aren ’ t for taking photos and you can always use headphones . What you do get is solid if not spectacular performance , and tight integration with Amazon ’ s other services through Fire OS , all at a price that ’ s well below most of the non-Amazon branded competition . You should also note that if you already own the 2016 or 2017 version of this tablet , it wo n't be worth upgrading to the 2018 version as the differences are minimal .

The incredibly low price and sturdy design make the Amazon Fire 7 ( 2019 ) a great choice to give to a kid – in fact , Amazon ’ s even built a ( slightly pricier ) version specifically for children . But even for a grown audience the Amazon Fire 7 far exceeds expectations , with a fairly bright 7-inch screen , acceptable speakers , solid battery life and even reasonable performance , with a snappy interface and the ability to run most games . The last gen Fire 7 was remarkably similar to this latest product , but this comes with the choice of 16GB or 32GB of storage and there are some improvements to the front camera too . Fire OS won ’ t suit everyone and this isn ’ t a tablet that impresses once you take the price out of the equation , but for what the Amazon Fire costs it would almost be rude not to buy it .

Intel may no longer hold its chief rival at arm 's length , as it reportedly plans to open up its fabrication facilities to chip designs by ARM Holdings . Major Intel partner Altera announced this week that its new Stratix 10 system-on-a-chip will use ARM 's quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A53 CPU . The plan is to start production in 2014 , and Intel will manufacture the Stratix 10 , as reported by CNET . The move is significant because despite Intel 's overall market share , it has had trouble competing in the all-important mobile chip marketplace . It 's an area that ARM has cornered , having licensed the designs of over 95 % of mobile processors on the marketplace right now . Pretty much every top smartphone this year , from the Galaxy S4 to the iPhone 5S , has been powered by ARM 's efficiently designed chips . The Altera chip is destined for high-end networking and communication equipment , meaning you should n't look for it to take on consumer-facing chips . But it is a significant step forward in Intel/ARM relations and Intel 's hopes for mobile . Intel 's Atom processors have lagged behind , but if the company were to start making chips designed by ARM , it could start selling them to companies like Apple . That could give Apple an out when it comes to paying Samsung to manufacturer its A7 SoC . Despite all of the Apple-Samsung lawsuits and cutthroat competition between iOS and Android , Apple still has n't managed to ditch Samsung as the manufacturer of its silicon . An Intel and ARM agreement could be a boon for just about everyone else , too . `` It 's huge , '' said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood to Forbes . `` Imagine ARM 's most powerful and technologically advanced 64-bits processor built on Intel 's leading-edge fabs . A duo that will be hard to beat . '' More competition among rival chip manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC could mean cheaper processors and smaller bills of sale , all in all a good thing for consumers .

Intel could be putting its still-unseen internet TV service up for adoption . AllThingsD got the tip from sources that the processor manufacturer is close to finalizing a deal with US carrier Verizon to take over the former 's web TV plans . According to the anonymous sources , the two companies are in `` advanced negotiations '' to turn control of Intel Media over to the carrier . However , it 's not clear whether the entire Media unit would be under Verizon 's command or if Intel could keep its fingers in the web TV pie or other parts of the business . While Intel 's TV service , called `` OnCue , '' has failed to reach market ( thanks in no small part to lack of entertainment partners ) , Verizon already has a sizable network with its paid FiOS TV service . An Intel deal could bring to Verzion TV customers new hardware that , for good or bad , wo n't be able to recognize your face . Intel originally announced its plans to enter the entertainment industry in January 2011 . Before that , the company was beating its chest with plans to install chips into HDTVs and how the Smart TV revolution is the `` biggest since the move to color . '' To help build a viable platform , the PC part maker enlisted Ex-BBCer Erik Huggers . Huggers brought on a team of 300 employees who built the box over which the internet TV platform would stream . Intel workers numbering in the thousands were said to be testing out the service . The plan was to have OnCue out before the end of 2013 , but without content partner backing , its release was seemingly shelved until 2014 . Huggers , by the way , was recently reported to be eying the CEO position at Hulu . Someone else got the job , but it could be a sign the Intel Media head has long seen the writing on the wall . And yet , with Verizon reportedly throwing it a lifeline , Intel 's TV plans may have a shot at making it afterall .

The chipset is n't as powerful , the cameras are n't as impressive and the screen is n't as beautiful ... but it 's around half the price , and all of its specs are still quite impressive for a slate at this price . It 's a remarkably good product considering how much you 're spending on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite . It is n't particularly smaller than the Galaxy Tab S6 - and ironically , it 's actually heavier too - but if you do n't want to spend top-dollar you may love this . Read our full Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite review A great Android alternative to the iPad Mini Weight : 316g | Dimensions : 212.6 x 124.8 x 7.3mm | OS : Android 8 | Screen size : 8.4-inch | Resolution : 1600 x 2560 | CPU : HiSilicon Kirin 960 | RAM : 4GB | Storage : 32GB/64GB/128GB | Battery : 5,100mAh | Rear camera : 13MP | Front camera : 8MP The Huawei MediaPad M5 8.4 is a strong Android slate and the combination of its small size and metal shell makes it a real alternative to the iPad Mini . This has more than just good looks though , as the MediaPad M5 8.4 also has impressive stereo speakers , and coupled with its sharp 1600 x 2560 screen that ensures it lives up to its name as a media machine . It ’ s less good for gaming , and there ’ s no 3.5mm headphone port – so you probably will be relying on those internal speakers a lot , but if you want a very portable slate that ’ s great for movies and music then the Huawei MediaPad M5 8.4 is a top option . Read our Huawei MediaPad M5 8.4 review Now cheaper , but still impressive Weight : 482g | Dimensions : 249.3 x 164.3 x 7.1mm | OS : Android 9 | Screen size : 10.5-inch | Resolution : 1600 x 2560 | CPU : Snapdragon 835 | RAM : 6GB | Storage : 64/256GB | Battery : 7,300mAh | Rear camera : 13MP | Front camera : 8MP The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 was once our best Android tablet , but now it has been bumped down by the Galaxy Tab S6 , among other things . It 's not exactly cheap - although its price has dropped significantly in recent months - but it comes packing a whole host of features to ensure you 're getting plenty of bang for your buck . Unlike Apple 's iPad Pro range , the Galaxy Tab S4 comes with Samsung 's S Pen stylus included in the box , while under the hood you get the powerful Snapdragon 835 chipset alongside 6GB of RAM ensuring Android runs super-smoothly on screen . That 's only half the story though . Pair the Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 with a keyboard and mouse and it 'll transfer from Android into a desktop-like experience as it attempts to replace your laptop as well as your tablet . The desktop aspect of the tablet is limited , but still useful . In short , the Galaxy Tab S4 is one of the most versatile Android tablets around . Read our Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 review The best cheap Android tablet around Weight : 300g | Dimensions : 210 x 123 x 7mm | OS : Android 7.0 | Screen size : 8-inch | Resolution : 1200 x 1920 | CPU : Snapdragon 625 | Storage : 16GB/64GB | Battery : 4850mAh | Rear camera : 8MP | Front camera : 5MP In a sea of slates and smartphones , crafting a device that has enough personality to stand out and enough quality to be worth caring about is a difficult proposition . With the Tab 4 8 Plus , Lenovo has succeeded in producing something with a flavor of its own , and something that makes the mid-range Android tablet market worth attention once again . If you already have an Android device , commute regularly and want something a little nicer than an Amazon tablet , this is the obvious next step . Read our Lenovo Tab 4 8 Plus review A cheap tablet with a huge screen Weight : 504g | Dimensions : 262 x 159 x 9.8mm | OS : Fire OS | Screen size : 10.1-inch | Resolution : 1920 x 1200 | CPU : octa-core | Storage : 32GB/64GB | Battery : up to 12 hours | Rear camera : 2MP | Front camera : 2MP The Amazon Fire HD 10 ( 2019 ) is essentially built for Amazon Prime members , since its big 10.1-inch 1200 x 1920 screen is a great way to consume the films , TV shows and even ebooks it gives you access to . And the Amazon-centric interface used – which won ’ t appeal to everyone – ensure you ’ re never far from Amazon Prime content . That ’ s not to say you shouldn ’ t buy the Amazon Fire HD 10 ( 2019 ) if you ’ re not an Amazon Prime member . This is a durable , affordable slate with reasonable specs for the money , so it ’ s also a strong choice for anyone on a tight budget . But some of the options above in this list will likely be a better fit if money is no object . Read our Amazon Fire HD 10 ( 2019 ) review The best you can get at this price Weight : 363g | Dimensions : 214mm x 128mm x 9.7mm | OS : Fire OS | Screen size : 8-inch | Resolution : 1280 x 800 | CPU : Quad-core 1.3GHz | RAM : 1.5GB | Storage : 16/32GB | Battery : Up to 10 hours | Rear camera : 2MP | Front camera : 2MP The Amazon Fire HD 8 ( 2018 ) is among the best of the retail giant 's tablets , as while it 's in many ways lower end than the similar HD 10 , the smaller screen makes it more portable . It also delivers surprisingly strong gaming performance , with a decent amount of power for the money . The speakers aren ’ t great and the cameras are awful , but tablets aren ’ t for taking photos and you can always use headphones . What you do get is solid if not spectacular performance , and tight integration with Amazon ’ s other services through Fire OS , all at a price that ’ s well below most of the non-Amazon branded competition . You should also note that if you already own the 2016 or 2017 version of this tablet , it wo n't be worth upgrading to the 2018 version as the differences are minimal . Read our Amazon Fire HD 8 ( 2018 ) review Almost unbelievably cheap Weight : 286g | Dimensions : 115mm x 192mm x 9.6mm | OS : Fire OS | Screen size : 7-inch | Resolution : 1024 x 600 | CPU : Quad-core 1.3GHz | RAM : 1GB | Storage : 16/32GB | Battery : Up to 7 hours | Rear camera : 2MP | Front camera : 2MP Tablets don ’ t get any cheaper than this – well , functional ones don ’ t anyway . The incredibly low price and sturdy design make the Amazon Fire 7 ( 2019 ) a great choice to give to a kid – in fact , Amazon ’ s even built a ( slightly pricier ) version specifically for children . But even for a grown audience the Amazon Fire 7 far exceeds expectations , with a fairly bright 7-inch screen , acceptable speakers , solid battery life and even reasonable performance , with a snappy interface and the ability to run most games . The last gen Fire 7 was remarkably similar to this latest product , but this comes with the choice of 16GB or 32GB of storage and there are some improvements to the front camera too . Fire OS won ’ t suit everyone and this isn ’ t a tablet that impresses once you take the price out of the equation , but for what the Amazon Fire costs it would almost be rude not to buy it .

Intel has had to delay its upcoming Broadwell chip until the first three months of 2014 due to a manufacturing hiccup . Brian Krzanich , the company 's CEO , explained the issue while going through Intel 's finances with analysts , calling it a `` defect density issue '' - basically , Intel has made too many broken chips and not enough working ones . Happily , Intel has fixed the issues now so manufacturing can go ahead , but it still means an extra three months to wait before the hardware will make it into phones , tablets and other devices . We saw the Broadwell chip in action back at IDF this year ; the 14nm chip ran against its predecessor , Haswell , and blew it out of the water in terms of performance . Benefits of the Broadwell chipset include speed , size and a boost to graphics capabilities . But perhaps the most enticing element is that the Broadwell chip offers increased power efficiency - and anything that means our devices spend fewer hours on charge is all right by us . With January - March 2014 pencilled into Intel 's release diary , we should start seeing machines with the new chip hitting the shelves sometime after April 2014 .

Fact the first : Intel makes by far the best PC processors you can buy . Fact the second : They 're still nowhere near Intel 's best technology . So I 'm here to ask - to beg , even - Intel to reward its long-loyal PC customers with something to get excited about . I 'm not asking for all that much . Just for Intel to put chips it 's already making into PCs . The detailed request goes something like this . Intel recently rolled out what is ostensibly its latest and greatest range-topping PC processor , the Core i7-4960X . Now , I 've been moaning about Intel sand bagging with its desktop PC processor for years . But the 4960X is by far and away the worst and most disappointing example of Intel dragging its corporate heels yet . The 4960X has the same core count and pretty much the same clocks as its predecessor . It 's barely any faster . And it 's not even based on Intel 's most modern CPU architecture . Truly , I 'd like to know what went through heads when the decision was made to unleash this zero-step-change effort as a new top-end chip . The gains are so incremental as to be almost invisible . The other half of this equation involves the chips Intel has at its disposal . Intel has recently rolled out three new high performance processor dies , known as the Ivy Bridge-EP family . Respectively , they 're six , 10 and 12-core chips , though further configurations are possible courtesy of switching cores off . Anyway , what 's very clear is that there 's ample opportunity for shipping a desktop PC processor with more than the six cores currently offered by the 4960X . There are some arguments against this simplistic observation . First is that the three new chips are actually built for servers and workstation . True enough . But then the 4960X is itself based on the six-core version of Ivy Bridge-EP . So that objection pretty much evaporates . Then there 's the cores-versus-clock defence . In the past , Intel has argued that its six-core enthusiast chips have offered the best balance of cores and clockspeed for PC performance . The idea is that some of the most critical apps for PC users – most notably , games – do n't scale well when you add cores . They 're still substantially bound by per-core performance . And you can have more of that by cranking up clockspeeds . At the same time , there 's only so much power available to a chip , only so much thermal budget . Chop off a couple of cores and you can crank up the clocks a bit . In practice , that argument has n't really held . For starters , games are only becoming more and more threaded , a process which is surely set to accelerate with the two new eight-core consoles from Microsoft and Sony , both of which have feeble per-core performance and will depend on efficient multi-core scaling to achieve decent CPU performance . Then there 's the fact that with the previous generation of Intel CPUs , there was only a few hundred MHz clock difference between the top six-core desktop chip and its eight-core server cousin . I also realise there are issues for Intel in terms of putting out relatively low cost desktop chips that offer server-class features and then watching sales being cannibalised . But there are various ways Intel can and already does limit the scope for that . Things like nixing support for multi-socket or maybe even virtualisation . One thing Intel has been great at recently is finding ways to hobble CPUs , so that really should n't be a problem . Anyway , I really think this is an easy win for Intel . There 's a creeping negativity surrounding almost everything it does right now . It has yet to convince the world its ultra-mobile offerings have compelling advantages over the ARM collective on the one hand . On the other , it treats its tradition desktop PC customers with apparent disdain . For me it 's an easy PR win to blow away the enthusiast community with something outrageously good on the desktop . Get the tech community revved about something Intel . Some of that enthusiasm might then spill over in to other areas and help spread the word about Intel 's mobile offerings . Which are actually phenomenally good and not really treated fairly . A bit like Intel 's desktop customers , then .
Tech giants Google , Samsung , Intel and Samsung are reportedly in talks with BlackBerry over a potential buyout of some , or all of the struggling smartphone giant . Reuters brings word that the firms , which are also said to include Cisco and SAP , have responded to a plea from BlackBerry for interest from potential late bidders for the firm . According to the report , BlackBerry has requested `` preliminary expressions of interest '' from all of the companies and has asked that they reply in the next week if they fancy a piece of the action . As yet , it is completely unclear as to whether any of the company 's would stake a claim for BlackBerry 's hardware , software or patent properties . BlackBerry itself is still shopping around for the best deal , despite agreeing in principal to sell the ailing firm to a consortium led by Fairfax Financial for $ 4.7 billion ( about £2.93bn , AU $ 4.98bn ) As part of that agreement , the Warterloo-based firm was permitted to seek a better deal , while Fairfax performed its due diligence . Should nothing materialise from other potential bidders and the Fairfax consortium is satisfied with the outcome of its research then a deal should be completed by early November . One thing that may interest the likes of Google and Samsung is BlackBerry 's strong patent arsenal , but the value of which is likely to halve within the next 18 months , Reuters reports . It 's secure messaging , and email services could also provide a boost to the aforementioned companies .

Intel is launching a Raspberry Pi equivalent to help software developers , artists and other creative types launch do-it-yourself hardware projects . Intel 's Galileo Board features the the company 's Quark SoC X1000 , a low-power 400Mhz processor designed for use in wearable tech and 'Internet of Things ' data sensors . It partnered with Rome-based Arduino to launch the board , which runs Arduino 's software development kit on an open-source Linux operating system . The board features a number of industry-standard I/O interfaces including ACPI , PCI Express , 10/100MB Ethernet , SD and USB 2.0 . Intel says that around 17 universities will receive a total of around 1,000 boards , with institutions in Ireland being among the first . It says that the board can be used to program anything from interactive designs like LED lights that respond to social media to more complex projects such as automating home appliances and building robots controlled by smartphones . Intel Galileo will be available from November , the company says , though a price is still under wraps .

It fits in your hand . And it might just be all the PC you 'll ever need . Give it up for the latest Intel Next Unit of Computing , or NUC for short . We reckon NUC might just be the best ultra-small form factor ( SFF ) PC you can buy . But it 's still far too expensive . The basic specs of the latest NUC involve one of Intel 's new Haswell CPUs , a slightly slimmed down case and a rethink of some of the features including the ports . But it 's really the overall computing experience that matters with the NUC , not the hard numbers . It 's a really nice little device . That said , let 's get the basics out of the way . The dimension are downright diminutive . We 're talking roughly 11cm square and 3.5cm deep . This thing is very small . Inside , there 's an Intel Core i5-4250U CPU . That 's two cores , four threads , 1.3GHz base clock and 2.6GHz Turbo . Oh and it has Intel 's latest 40-unit graphics core . In this case it 's somewhat bizarrely branded with the old Intel HD Graphics moniker rather than the new Intel Iris brand that most of the 40-unit graphics cores receive . You get two USB 3.0 ports up front , two more on the back and one each regards mini DisplayPort and HDMI . Suitably specified , the NUC gives a great all round computing experience . It looks and feels like a quality item . Inside , it 's a really nicely integrated bit of electronics . It even supports 4K ultra-HD resolutions . Oh , and the Wi-Fi reception from the built-in antenna is superb . Of course , you 'll pay extra for the actual Wi-Fi adapter . Similarly you do n't get a hard drive , memory or a copy of Windows . All of those things cost extra . Which is where the pricing problem kicks in . UK pricing has n't quite shaken out on the new NUC . But based on the previous generation NUC , you 're looking at perhaps as much as £350 for the barebones Core i5 version and thus at least £500 and probably more like £600 for a nicely specified solution . And that 's before you 've even added a screen . And that 's just far too much money . The first problem is Intel 's processor pricing . The Intel Core i5-4250U CPU has an official US Price of $ 342 . The NUC 's is $ 363 ( remember , US prices do n't include a value added tax , so you ca n't just do a straight exchange-rate conversion ) . So you 're getting the NUC chassis and board for just $ 21 dollars , which tells you plenty about how much wiggle room there is in the processor price . Plenty . But the problem is that the NUC can hardly be sold for less than the Intel Core i5-4250U itself . It puts a hard floor on how low Intel can go with NUC pricing . Then compare NUC pricing to laptops and ultrabooks . For the same £600 you 'd spend on a nicely optioned NUC , you can have any number of thin and light – or big and brutish for that matter - Core i5 laptops and ultrabooks . Except , of course , you get a screen and a lithium battery and all the other portable accoutrements thrown in . So you may as well just buy one of those . It 'll do pretty much everything a NUC will . But there 's lots a laptop can do the NUC ca n't . Hell , you could buy a very nice laptop and a good tablet for the price of a NUC-plus-screen . Of course , NUC looks good value compared to other Intel-based ultra-small form factor systems . But so what ? The segment in general looks inflated , again presumably because of those processor prices . In fairness , AMD-based ultra-SFF systems are n't a whole lot better . But the bottom line is that the NUC and its ilk need to be cheaper . It makes no sense for them to cost the same as a similarly specified thin and light notebook and then still leave you needing a screen . They need to be cheap enough that people buy them as well as a portable . I 'd say £350 maximum for a Core i5 NUC with a 120GB-ish SSD , some memory and Windows 8 . We reckon what Intel and the industry at large needs to appreciate is that most people are happy with their laptops as a PC to use at home . More worryingly , they 're increasingly happy with their ARM-based tablets , too . So the lovely little NUC needs to be something punters can pick as a discretionary extra , cheap enough they do n't have to think too hard about pulling the trigger . And £500 to £600 plus a screen is n't even close .

For now Apple 's new iPad Air and its other A7-processor equipped devices are sitting pretty as 64-bit mobile devices , but Intel says that 's all going to change next year . The chipmaker revealed as much during an investor meeting this week , where CEO Brian Krzanich informed attendees that the company is developing a 64-bit version of the Android . The plan is to release tablets running the OS following Bay Trail tablets running 64-bit versions of Microsoft 's Windows 8.1 . The Windows 8.1 tabs are expected in the first quarter next year . Krzanich went on to say that Android tablets equipped with Bay Trail processors could come with a starting price of $ 150 ( about £92/AU $ 162 ) . What 's more , apparently all Bay Trail chips already support 64-bit addressing , which means a software update could make a whole range of Bay Trail devices 64-bit capable as well . Intel is also currently developing an image of Android 4.4 KitKat . For a long while now , most Android mobile devices ran on ARM or Intel processors equipped with 32-bit versions of the OS . Meanwhile , Apple 's latest hardware , namely the iPad Air , iPad Mini 2 with Retina display and iPhone 5S , have the A7 processor and 64-bit iOS operating system . Technically speaking Apple is n't the first 64-bit mobile device maker . Microsoft introduced its original Surface Pro tablet running a full version of 64-bit Windows 8 last year . But this is closer to carrying around a full-fledge PC because it packed a real Intel Core i5 processor . Semantics aside , a 64-bit system on mobile devices grants access to greater increased system memory and paves the way for Ultra HD video . Thirty-two-bit systems thus far have always been limited to 4GB of RAM . It probably wo n't be a big issue for some years to come , especially as the only phone that will reach this memory limit is the rumored Samsung Galaxy S5 . Currently 3GB of RAM is the highest we 've seen on handset like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and LG G2 . Via PC World

Intel may have been late to the mobile party , but it 's making every effort not to miss the Internet of Things ( IoT ) boat before it sets sail ( possibly to a far away land full of Wi-Fi enabled fridges , kettles and bathroom scales ) . According to Reuters , the company has created an 'Internet of Things Solution Group ' to develop software and hardware for electronic IoT devices . Headed by Doug Davies , previously the leader of Intel 's embedded chip group , the new unit will report directly to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich . No pressure , then . Intel has already developed its own CPU , named Quark , for use in IoT devices . The low-power SoC ( system-on-chip ) processor features on its Galileo Board that can be used in do-it-yourself hardware projects . Intel 's new group could work on an almost limitless range of potential products as the IoT phenomenon is based around letting you connect any object up to the internet by integrating Wi-Fi functionality in it . That includes an increasing number of wearable tech products creeping into the market , some of which feature chips by ARM , a company focused on developing `` high-performance , low-power '' processors for IoT devices . Its Cortex-M3 CPU has wormed its way into early smartwatches on the market , including the Sony 's SmartWatch 2 , the Qualcomm Toq and Pebble . Cisco recently formed a similar unit , dubbed the ( wait for it ) 'Internet of Things Group ' , which will focus on partnering technology start-ups in the field and assisting with research , security , sensors , real-time analytics and applications .

Although Intel 's latest line of Haswell chips just hit motherboards earlier this year , early reports are already flying that the chip maker 's next Broadwell architecture will come with 18 cores in tow . Vr-zone has word that a new Intel chip possessing six more cores than anything currently on market could be implemented on the upcoming Broadwell-EP or EX Xeon chips . The publication posited that Intel would simply pile on more cores on each die instead of speeding them up . It 's a move we could see Intel pulling as an evolution of its multi-core strategy , which has already introduced the freshly minted 22nm Ivy Bridge and Haswell parts . Intel 's next line of chips supposedly will be produced with a 14-nanometer microarchitecture process . In addition to 18-core chips , we could see eight-to-10 core chips powering high performance desktop and fast-core workstations that push speeds above 4GHz - and that 's before any overclocking shenanigans . The Vr-zone report goes on to speculate that future processors will run with faster RAM , bumping up the top spec from DDR3-1866 to DDR4-2400 . The new chipset will also supposedly support up to 16 memory DIMMs or modules at the same time . All this power wo n't come at the expense of energy hogging PCs and devices , however . CPU World reported that the Broadwell microarchitecture will mainly aim at the mobile computing crowd with a special low wattage `` Y '' lineup . This way users ' pants and hands wo n't be burned with anything that uses enough electricity to push past a 4.5 Watt thermal envelope . Across the CPU isle , AMD 's Kaveri APU plans to be the end all , be all of CPU/GPU combos this coming January . Unlike Intel , AMD is more interested in buffing up its onboard GPU power and backing it with games designed for the architecture through Mantle . If Intel has something truly 18 core on its road map , you can bet we 'll see it or at least have an early look during CES 2014 .

Details of Intel 's new processor line-up , codenamed 'Broadwell ' , have been leaked this week . Most likely to be aimed at the notebook and laptop market , smaller machines would set to gain the most from the changes in efficiency and Thermal Design Power ( TDP ) that the new Intel generation offers . Broadwell splits the processor types into three : `` H '' high performance and `` Y '' and `` U '' for ultra low voltage . `` H '' type processors ( high performance ) composed of dual chip and single chip types . The dual chip will include four CPU cores and the single chip two cores . Dual chip processors will include the GT3e or GT2 GPUs and up to 6 MB of L3 cache . It will support up to 32GB of DDR3L memory at 1600mhz . The TDP will be set at 47 watts , and a new chipset , the 'HM97 ' , will be introduced . The `` U '' and `` Y '' series will be single-chip only platforms and house up to two cores with 4MB of L3 cache . `` U '' models will be able to support up to 16GB of DDR3L-1600 or 8GB of LPDDR3-1600 memory . Both chip types will have either 15 watt or 28 watt TDP . 15 watt models of the `` U '' and `` Y '' series will come with GT3 and GT2 graphics , while Celeron and Pentium SKUs will be limited to GT1 graphics . 28 watt chips will only be available with the GT3 GPU and will only be offered as Core i3 , Core i5 and Core i7 products . Possibly the most interesting in the Broadwell line-up are the `` Y '' ultra-low power SoCs . The parts in these will fit into a 4.5 watt thermal envelope and a 3.5 watt configurable TDP . The chips will have two CPU cores , GT2 graphics and up to 4MB of L3 . The processors will work with LPDDR3-1600 memory and will support up to 8GB of RAM . With such a low power draw this configuration would give netbooks and tablets extremely high battery life . The 'Broadwell ' generation is set for release in Q2 of 2014 .

How does a major tech brand make its logo stand out on a football shirt ? We 're not designers by trade , but we reckon putting it on the front of the kit where you can see it might be a good start . FC Barcelona has decided against such folly , instead placing Intel 's logo inside the team 's jersey after signing a sponsorship deal with the chipmaker . It 's possibly Barcelona 's most pointless deal to date , which is impressive for a club that once signed Alexander Hleb for €15 million . The European footballing giant will be supplied with 2-in-1 convertibles as part of the sponsorship , and Intel will be working with the club to `` improve the fan experience through new technology '' at its Camp Nou stadium , according to a statement . Whether that will improve Messi , Xavi and Inesta 's already stellar technical skills remains to be seen . Get your kit on , give me three warm up laps and check out these tasty blips :

Intel has announced the closure of AppUp , its PC app store . The firm has cited the need to focus , `` on developing the next generation of platform innovation '' as the reason for the store 's demise . AppUp will close its doors on March 11 2014 with support provided via email until June 15 . Users have been advised to keep the AppUp client installed and update it following the closure of the store to ensure that downloaded apps continue to work . Intel has advised that most applications should continue to work as normal and that refunds will be offered for apps that users have paid for . A number of apps that use a special technology that protects them from being pirated or duplicated will work until May 15 2015 . AppUp was launched in 2010 . Its initial focus was netbooks with a view to eventually catering for other devices as well , such as smartphones and TVs .

ARM has this week released a server standards guide to help designers and companies cooperate to create applications more compatible with servers employing its architecture . This could be the latest move by the Cambridge-based company in its challenge against Intel , which holds more than 95 per cent of the market for server chips . ARM was quick to point out in its announcement that the move was backed and aided by companies like Citrix , Microsoft , Red Hat , and OEMs Dell and HP . The latter already have projects for offering low-power microservers based on ARM system-on-chips ( SoCs ) . The specifications are readily available to download and are focused on providing a framework for the deployment of solutions in key areas such firmware , the operating system and server hypervisors , according to ARM . Software developers can now work within a set of standards to make their applications adapt more fluidly with ARM 's server architecture . Creating an expanding user base will be key for the company , especially following the closure of ARM-based manufacturer Calxeda in December last year . The move is consistent with the Open Compute Project , of which ARM is a member . Frank Frankovsky , president and chairman of the Open Compute Project , said : `` These standardization efforts will help speed adoption of ARM in the datacenter by providing consumers and software developers with the consistency and predictability they require , and by helping increase the pace of innovation in ARM technologies by eliminating gratuitous differentiation in areas like device enumeration and boot process . '' Intel , however , will likely not bow down to this announcement . The company has recently launched its new `` Avoton '' SoCs that it claims exceeds ARM 's tech in performance and power efficiency .

Intel 's funny wireless earpiece , known as Jarvis , will process your voice commands on device instead of using the internet and causing you to wait long , tedious seconds for your results . The problem with most voice recognition services is that they have to outsource the actual work of figuring out what you 've said to a more powerful machine elsewhere , using the internet to transmit it . The time it takes to send your voice command off , process it and return the result is generally about the same amount of time it takes for you to get annoyed . But Intel says it has , with the help of an anonymous third party , created a processor/software combo powerful enough to translate the human voice but small enough to fit onto its Jarvis headset . That means that while Jarvis works better in tandem with an internet connection and a phone or a tablet , it can also function on its own . Intel is also trying to sell its small-but-mighty voice recognition tech to other companies , so we could soon see it popping up in other phones and tablets . Via Quartz

Verizon and Intel have announced that the former will purchase the assets of Intel Media , Intel 's cloud TV arm . As well as acquiring the intellectual property rights and assets of Intel 's OnCue Cloud TV platform , Verizon will offer jobs to most of the 350 employees at Intel Media , which will remain based in Santa Clara . Verizon says that the deal will help to speed up the development of next-generation video services , including its own fibre-optic networks and those delivered `` over the top '' . `` The OnCue platform and team will help Verizon bring next-generation video services to audiences who increasingly expect to view content when , where and how they want it , '' said Lowell McAdam , Chairman and CEO of Verizon , in a joint statement . `` Verizon already has extensive video content relationships , fixed and wireless delivery networks , and customer relationships in both the home and on mobile . This transaction provides us with the capabilities to build a powerful , capitally efficient engine for future growth and innovation . '' McAdam stressed that the transaction would provide an opportunity for Verizon to improve the delivery of its video services . Following the purchase , the company plans to integrate IP-based TV services with its fiber-optic services with a view to reducing deployment costs and improving the user experience for its fibre-optic customers . Intel is expected to refocus on its more traditional market of computing chips , in particular with wearable devices in mind . `` This sale also enables Intel to further align our focus and resources around advancing our broad computing product portfolio in segments ranging from the Internet-of-Things to data centers , '' said Chief Executive of Intel , Brian Krzanich . The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of this year pending regulatory approvals .
A Nexus 8 tablet may be with us as soon as the middle of the year and it might ditch Qualcomm in favor of an Intel Bay Trail-T processor . That 's according to DigiTimes , which spoke to sources from the 'upstream supply chain ' , although we 've found these particular information providers very hit and miss in the past . The source claims that this new focus on an 8-inch tablet is in response to disappointing sales of the new Nexus 7 . The source goes on to say that Asus , the company which currently makes the Nexus 7 , will probably end up making the Nexus 8 too and that while an Intel processor is certainly possible , Qualcomm is still in the running too . If it does end up packing a Bay Trail-T processor then you can expect 64-bit quad-core performance . No other details have been revealed , but the source states that additional information is likely to be available after February , which suggests that an MWC unveiling is probably not on the cards . This is n't the first time we 've heard rumors that Google might be working on an 8-inch Nexus tablet , but what was once thought to be the Nexus 8 turned out to be the LG G Pad 8.3 Google Play Edition . A device which could give the actual Nexus 8 a run for its money given how impressed we were by the standard version of the LG G Pad 8.3 .

Intel plans to reduce its global workforce by around 5,000 in 2014 as the chipmaker , struggling with falling PC sales , shifts focus to faster-growing areas . The confirmed the job cuts the day after it reported that its profit and revenue had fallen for the second consecutive year . Intel intends to jettison the jobs without laying off workers ; the reduction with be done through attrition , buyouts and early retirement offers . Intel dominates the PC chip industry , but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets , markets now dominated by rivals such as Qualcomm and Samsung . On top of that , worldwide PC sales have dropped from the previous year in seven consecutive quarters , an unprecedented decline . Last week Intel also announced that a newly built factory , a multi-billion dollar project aimed at building Intel 's most advanced chips , would remain closed for the foreseeable future . Intel has both added and shed significant numbers of jobs over the past decade . Struggling to fend off a challenge by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices in 2006 , Intel announced it would reduce its workforce by over 10 000 positions , but its overall number of employees has grown since then . Intel is n't the only company hit by the declining market for traditional PCs . Earlier this month HP announced that it would be eliminating 5,000 jobs in 2014 , bringing its multi-year restructuring plan up to a total of 34,000 layoffs .

Intel may have committed a CES 2014 fashion faux pas when it unveiled wearable technology prototypes that included rival ARM-based processors . Some of the company 's reference designs were indeed powered by third-party parts , including its smartwatch concept , Intel spokesperson Bill Calder told TechRadar . Calder characterized the mixed-and-matched components as not a big deal since Intel has an ARM license and the smartwatch is n't an announced product . It 's simply a prototype . He also denied previous reports that Jarvis , the company 's unique voice-controlled Bluetooth headset , was being powered with ARM components at the convention . But the problem with demoing any wearable with a non-Intel processor remains . Edison , Intel 's Quark-based chip , was concurrently being touted as an SD-card-sized solution for wearables . Unbeknownst to the CES audience , it 's just not for all wearables seen on that same stage . At least it 's all `` Intel Inside '' when it comes to Bay Trail Android tablets that the company said are due out in the second quarter of this year . Intel 's Atom-based processor is already up-and-running in a number of Windows-based slates , but the Bay Trail chips powering the newer Google devices will be 64-bit , not 32-bit . Intel and other chip manufacturers have been in a race to catch up to Apple , which debuted the first mobile 64-bit processor in its iPhone 5S , iPad Air and iPad mini 2 with Retina display . Of course , like Apple 's new hardware , Android users will have to wait for developers to start taking advantage of the superior Bay Trail specs before they really see a difference in performance .

Rays of light may finally be breaking through the storm clouds bearing down on the PC market . Intel has registered its Q4 and full year 2013 earnings report , and the buzzword around the beleaguered sector was `` stabilization . '' CEO Bryan Krzanich stated in its earnings release that the company witnessed `` signs of stabilization in the PC segment . '' CFO Stacy Smith noted in his commentary ( PDF ) that though the personal computer market was down for 2013 , `` We saw the market stabilize in the back half of the year with fourth quarter PC units up from a year ago . '' It 's not a whopping number , but Intel 's PC chip segment actually saw a 2 % revenue growth quarter-over-quarter . What 's more , its desktop chip business was up 7 % . Year-on-year notebook numbers were flat , though the average selling price was down 7 % . Despite competition from an influx of mobile chip makers , Intel remains the world 's largest silicon manufacturer . Signs that PC sales are stabilizing here bring good tidings for the rest of the industry . If they last . In a sign of the times , tablets picked up a good portion of PC slack for 2013 . Smith wrote the company `` saw strong tablet growth in the back half of the year . '' Together , PCs and tablets contributed to a unit grow for the quarter that `` was up almost 10 % from a year ago . '' The numbers are positive , but there 's still growth to be had in tablets and other mobile devices . The `` other Intel architecture operating segments , '' which blankets Atom chips for notebooks , tablets and smartphones , saw revenue up 4 % from the Q3 but down 7 % year-over year . Intel attributed the decline to poor netbook sales . According to the Wall Street Journal , the segment also contributed a hefty $ 125 million ( about £76.4m , AU $ 141.8m ) operating loss to the company 's bottom line . Though slates are by no means a silver bullet for yet , Intel anticipates 40 million tablets will ship with its silicon this year . The company is also expanding its focus beyond the PC , and tablet , into the `` other '' category . Krzanich cited Intel 's presence at CES 2014 were the company `` demonstrated multiple devices that were n't on our roadmap six months ago . '' He was referring to such products as Edison , Intel 's equivalent of Raspberry Pi , and a number of concept wearables . On a call with investors , as reported by The Verge , Krzanich reiterated Intel 's plan to have these products available this year . However , he did n't specify whether the actual devices shown in Vegas or simply the chips that make them tick will make it market . CFO Smith said on the call that Intel will organize its future investments around the data center , tablets and low-power chip sectors .

Hit by slumping personal computer sales , hardware giant Intel has put off opening a major chip factory . The `` Fab 42 '' facility built in Chandler , Arizona , will remain closed for the foreseeable future while other facilities at the same site will be upgraded . Intel 's decision not to open the chip plant was first reported on Tuesday . `` The new construction is going to be left vacant for now and it will be targeted at future technologies , '' Mulloy told Reuters . Despite not opening the new factory , or fab , Intel has exceeded a target to hire over 1 000 employees since construction started in 2011 , Mulloy said . Intel received state tax benefits for hiring those people . Barack Obama , while campaigning for re-election in 2012 , made a stop at the factory 's construction site , where he called for government incentives to attract manufacturing lost to Asia in recent years back to the US . Intel is the world 's top chip maker but it has been caught off guard by the success of smartphone and tablets , a revolution in computing that has eaten into the usual demand for PCs . Global PC shipment took a dive in 2013 , the worst year for the platform since Gartner began tracking it . It is currently expanding a plant in Oregon where engineers will work on a long-term plan to manufacture microchips on silicon wafers measuring 450mm . The largest currently used in the chip industry measure 300mm across . Plans by Intel and big rivals like Samsung Electronics to eventually expand to 450mm will allow them to save manufacturing costs by squeezing more chips on each production line . Intel , which on Thursday is due to report is fourth-quarter earnings , said in November it expects its revenue to be flat in 2014 compared to last year .

AMD 's latest APU is heading into the wild today , and among its touted features is the ability to perform high-end functions with low power sap . Testing is needed to determine if Kaveri really pushes higher performance per watt while saving battery life , particularly in smaller form factors ( AMD is targeting notebooks with the APU ) . But until then - and trust us , testing is on the way - AMD gave TechRadar a few cases in point where Kaveri trumps the APU and processing options we 've seen to date . We even get a little insight on possible usage in Steam Machines , too . We caught up with AMD 's Adam Kozak at CES 2014 , and the senior product marketing manager noted a key difference between Kaveri and the company 's APU before it , called `` Richland . '' `` [ Kaveri is ] much more power efficient than anything we 've had before , '' Kozak said . `` If you actually get a chip and you watch it run during benchmarks , you see in some cases that it actually down clocks the CPU during a benchmark . Richland never did that before . `` Richland would go down to its default clock and sit there while the benchmark was running . Kaveri will even go lower if it can see that the CPU or GPU is n't needed during that benchmark . `` So the guys have worked really hard at optimizing the power states and detecting where it 's needed and it 'll just crank it right down . It 's much more efficient then Richland ever was . '' Kozak also called to mind a demo AMD performed a few weeks ago to not only show Kaveri 's compute prowess but also how it compares efficiency-wise to rival Intel . AMD is gunning after Haswell - specifically its Core i5 - with the Kaveri stack , even undercutting Intel 's low-power chip on the price tag . As Kozak recalled , the AMD team was showing off Kaveri 's ability to frame rate convert Blu-rays . `` Some TVs run [ Blu-rays ] at 24 frames , but your monitors definitely run at 60 frames , '' he explained . `` If you ever watch a Blu-ray on your monitor , what it has to do is copy all those extra frames to duplicate them from 24 so it equals 60 . A lot of frames are repeated . When you 're watching something go across , it actually stutters because it 's the same frame being shown several times . `` What we do now with Kaveri is we actually interpolate . We use compute to say , 'Here 's the next frame , let 's figure out that maybe the difference is ... ' and we create a new frame . And it 's much smoother when it goes across . We can use Kaveri to all this compute computation . `` While we were doing this , we had it plugged into a wall meter , and the whole system itself was generating about 50 Watts , '' he said of the demo . `` That 's the whole system - hard drive , memory , everything . And the system beside it , an Intel system , generated well over 100 Watts with a graphics card in it . `` So Kaveri can not only do these really high-end features , but it can do them at very low power , and that 's what you want in an HTPC or a home theater type environment . '' Though Kozak could n't comment on unannounced partner products , the question arose whether the Kaveri and its low wattage would ever find its way into Steam Machines . `` I can tell you that Kaveri is actually a very unique part because of this feature [ called ] configurable TDP , '' Kozak said . `` There 's a setting in the BIOS [ where ] you can change your processor to run at 65 Watts or 45 Watts just with the click of a button . `` That 's something where if you want a very small form factor , like a Steam Box , you could have the SI automatically do that at the start . And it would allow you to put in a better graphics card if you wanted and use that TDP elsewhere . Or you could just reduce the form factor and use it . '' TDP stands for thermal design power , or the amount of power a chip will dissipate in Watts . A low TDP means easier cooling and fanless and small fan designs with more room for graphics , ideal for machines like Ultrabooks and , yes , Steam Machines . Both AMD and Intel have made their way into announced Machines , but perhaps a new chapter in their ongoing silicon war will heat up if Kaveri shacks up with a Box ? Kaveri seems primed for the fight .
AMD 's APU vision of the future is finally upon us . `` Kaveri , '' the company 's follow-up to `` Richland , '' is seeing the light of day , along with its long-awaited pricing tiers . Priced above Richland and below Intel 's `` Haswell '' line , AMD will launch the top-end A10-7850K for $ 173 ( about £105 , AU $ 190 ) , the middle-tier A10-7700K for $ 152 ( about £92 , AU $ 167 ) , and the bottom rung A8-7600 for $ 119 ( about £72 , AU $ 131 ) . Depending on the retailer , Intel 's Core i5-4670K , i5-4440S and i3-4330 chips fall between $ 242 ( about £147 , AU $ 267 ) and $ 127.99 ( about £78 , AU $ 141 ) from the high to low end . The two Kaveri A10s are available starting today , and will come bundled with EA 's Battlefield 4 . The A8 will begin shipping sometime in Q1 2014 . From a bird's-eye view , the Kaveri die measures 245mm squared , holds 2.41 billion transistors and is built on 28nm-SHP . All feature integrated Radeon R7 graphics . Kaveri houses up to four multi-threaded `` Steamroller '' CPU cores and up to eight Graphics Core Next ( GCN ) GPU cores , comprising what AMD is calling the chip 's `` compute cores . '' AMD pocketed the term to describe the CPU/GPU system humming inside Kaveri , one that 's designed to deliver 50 % more GPU performance and up to 20 % better x86 IPC . Kaveri 's graphics cores have the same design as AMD 's `` Hawaii , '' but with the addition of coherent shared unified ( hUMA ) memory . Like Hawaii , Kaveri supports AMD 's TrueAudio tech . Thanks to Heterogeneous System Architecture ( HSA ) , Kaveri 's compute cores have equal access to the entire memory ( up to 32GB ) , are equally flexible to dispatch workloads , and are each able to unlock all CPU and GPU Gflops . In AMD 's words , HSA abolishes the `` tariffs '' between the CPU and GPU . Also with HSA , Kaveri can lay claim to the first full OpenCL 2.0 capable chip . The top marked A10-7850K packs the maximum 12 compute cores and has a max turbo core of 4.0GHz . Its default CPU frequency hits 3.7GHz and its GPU frequency 720MHz . L2 cache measures 4MB and overall power runs at 95W . The A10-7700K clocks in with 10 compute cores , and a max turbo core of 3.8GHz . Default CPU frequency flips at 3.4GHz and the GPU has the same 720MHz . Users will also find here 4MB of L2 cache and a power wattage of 95 . Lastly , the A8 runs at a significantly lower power sap ( 65W/45W ) , though it too has 10 compute cores . The max turbo core runs 3.8GHz/3.3GHz and default CPU frequency idles around 3.3GHz/3.1GHz . GPU frequency is locked at 720MHz , and L2 cache at 4MB . AMD has spent months drumming up developer support and public interest in Kaveri and its associated tech , namely the Mantle API , GCN architecture , TrueAudio and HSA . During the company 's Tech Day at CES 2014 , the message on what product segment AMD is lobbying for with the new APU was made loud and clear : Kaveri is `` targeted to win the notebook . '' Harnessing more performance per watt and extending battery life in lightweight form factors - ahem , notebooks - are two of AMD 's central design goals with the chip . To those ends , Senior Product Marketing Manager Adam Kozak told TechRadar that AMD focused on the 35W to 45W slice of the power pie with Kaveri . According to Kozak , Kaveri is ideal for free-to-play games , `` kids games , '' multiplayer and indie titles , and can run them `` very , very fast at 1080 [ p ] maximum graphics . '' However , the resolutions do n't stop at 1080p . Kaveri also supports 4K , something HSA helps it achieve by offloading and with compute performance , never burning through high wattages . Kozak said the 4K focus is on entertainment usage such as viewing movies , Photoshop and internet tasks , not games . AMD took a bit of a left turn - though a timely one - in demonstrating Kaveri 's proficiency in cryptocurrency . Turns out Kaveri is primed for data mining , and AMD found it can collect $ 704 ( about £429 , AU $ 777 ) annualized . Not a bad return for a $ 173 - $ 119 piece of silicon .

SteamOS users with AMD and Intel graphics processors will be happy to know that the latest update to Valve 's operating system adds full support for their GPUs . Previously only users with Nvidia graphics could install SteamOS , which is still in beta . This update to the `` alchemist '' build of SteamOS also includes the latest update to AMD 's Catalyst driver , and fixes general `` poor in-game performance '' and problems with the return-to-desktop function , according to a post by Valve 's Pierre-Loup Griffais . However , there are still known issues with screen tearing and poor performance of the Steam overlay while in-game . Griffais asks that users post their feedback to the SteamOS forum . Valve said in a forum post that this SteamOS update should go out automatically to existing SteamOS users . The alchemist update also fixed the Steam controller upgrade process , corrected an issue with Trine 2 's audio , and made other changes . However , Valve noted that users with `` Optimus '' solutions , where the PC dynamically switches between integrated Intel graphics and discreet Nvidia graphics , are not yet supported . For more on SteamOS , read everything to know about Valve 's operating system . Via Tom 's Hardware

Intel certainly isn ’ t the first player in the tech space to experiment with folding screen technology , but it ’ s definitely among the biggest to issue a patent . Obtained by Dutch tech news website LetsGoDigital , the 2017 patent exhaustively details a phone-like device that folds out into a complete tablet . The patent application from Intel is so precise that LetsGoDigital created 3D renders from the drawings , depicting the device running a mock version of Microsoft ’ s Windows 10 . Of course , we know that Microsoft is preparing its operating system for exactly this situation , so LetsGoDigital isn ’ t coming out of left field on this . Read more : Mii Mini PC Essentially , the device will stretch a single screen across three panels that fold into one another . When completely folded , the device acts like a full-screen smartphone . When one panel is left unfolded , the device acts like a tiny laptop with a touchscreen keyboard . Finally , the device becomes a full-blown tablet when completely unfolded out . This design would also support a stylus that tucks in between the folds of the displays when the device is closed , and held in place either with a clip or via magnets . This is n't the first time we ’ ve seen Intel experiment with folding and bending devices with multiple displays . During Computex 2018 in Taipei , Taiwan , Intel showed off two such prototypes as part of what is known as the Tiger Rapids project . One was a folding smartphone and another was a hybrid laptop device , and both employed two separate displays . We now know that not only has Intel been working on devices with multiple displays , but with screens that bend and fold along with the device ’ s hinges . If you thought that it was only Microsoft and Samsung that had big plans for folding screens , then prepare for a deluge of flexible devices in the near future . Via MSPowerUser
Kaveri , AMD 's next-gen APU ( Accelerated Processing Unit ) , has been revealed at the CES 2014 trade expo in Las Vegas . Kaveri is AMD 's third-generation performance APU and the first to feature heterogeneous system architecture ( HSA ) . It supports AMD 's TrueAudio technology and its Mantle API too . AMD promises that Kaveri will give `` vastly superior performance '' over competition that includes Intel 's Haswell range . The processors are designed to combat CPU and GPU combos , and with its highest configuration , the A10-7850K , being built on four `` Steamroller '' x86 multi-thread cores accompanied by eight graphics cores , they look well up for that fight . Kaveri offers up to 50 per cent more GPU and 20 per cent more CPU performance , as well as a system of shared memory and heterogeneous queuing that allows both CPU and GPU to create and dispatch work individually and efficiently . With up to twelve computable cores running simultaneously , it 's not hard to imagine how much that combo could chew through . Indeed , AMD claim that in system performance , the new Kaveri models ( A10-6800K and A10-7850K ) outperform Intel 's Core i5 4670K by 15 and 24 per cent respectively . Likewise in computing , gains of 7 and 63 per cent are claimed . Most impressively , in graphical power and gaming , this extends to 37 per cent and a whopping 87 per cent . Scalability is a big aim for AMD , who has spoken to TechRadar previously about the new processors . Optimised , the APUs will draw 45 to 95W with a configurable TDP , so those worrying about it melting their motherboard can rest easy . The Kaveri A-series will be on-shelf starting January 14 and are available to pre-order from system builders starting today .

Intel 's Mooly Eden was expected to talk about wearable technology during the corporation 's press conference at CES 2014 , but also moved things up a level , talking about in-body devices . `` Not far away we 'll see implanted devices , I think it 's inevitable , '' said Eden . `` [ You 'll be able ] to open the car door with your thumb . I believe I 'll live to see this change . '' Eden also believes we are on the verge of a major revolution in terms of on-body and in-body tech . `` Things are moving on from the PC and laptop . It 's not a carry with you , it 's a carry on you . It 's wearable . '' In terms of compute power for these , Eden took the logic of Moore 's Law to demonstrate that in 12 years processors will have more transistors than there are neurons in the human brain . That represents a whopping 3.5 million times performance increase since 1970 . Eden also talked up perceptual 3D computing , introducing Intel 's 3D camera that fits on a module less than the thickness of two quarter dollar coins . Intel envisages the camera will be embedded into partner devices soon and demonstrated Lenovo , Asus and Dell systems with the camera embedded . The technology behind the camera is called Intel RealSense and the corporation says it is bringing `` science fiction to reality '' with the development . Intel announced a partnership with 3D Systems as well as Microsoft for using the cameras for Skype and Lync . The cameras could also be used to extract face and body to appear on a virtual green screen by video content creators , something that was also demonstrated during the press conference . Eden also talked about making interaction far more naturalistic and had some interesting comments on touch interfaces . `` Keyboards are n't natural . Natural is about gestures and voice navigation . I would argue that voice is even more important than touch . Touch is n't intuitive because when we communicate we do n't touch people all the time . You do n't need an instruction book . '' Intel demonstrated using the 3D camera to use gestures on the Windows 8 Start screen as well as using head movements to look around a street scene in Google Street View . Intel also wanted to show off natural voice recognition with Dragon Assistant , although it did n't work first time in the demo , rather showing the challenges that more natural interfaces still face . And the fact the guy was n't really talking naturally when he did the demo really did n't help show Intel 's assertion that talking to devices is the most natural way forward .

Intel is looking to shake up its `` Intel inside '' computer processing roots by promising innovative wearable technology at CES 2014 that 'll have you wearing Intel on the outside . `` Wearables is wide open , '' said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich to Re/code in an interview . `` What you will see at CES is that we are actually going to bring some very innovative wearables to the show that are developed and manufactured here . '' Intel has previously confirmed that it has experimented with smartwatches in its labs , suggesting that wrist-mounted devices could be used to conveniently read text messages at a glance . It has also promised to become the competitive solution in the Internet of Things , as its technology has already made its way into heating and air conditioning units . Krzanich did n't tip his hand as to what we should expect from Intel 's wearable technology , but he did hint at the processor behind it . The company is preparing a new family of Quark chips . The low-powered System-on-a-Chip is expanding from household items to all sorts of Internet of Things devices , including wearables . `` Our view is that Quark can make almost everything smart , '' said Krzanich . `` We 'll show you some things that you would never have thought could become smart and communicate . '' While Intel is gearing up its wearable gadgets for next week , it 's also winding down its ambitious attempt to enter the pay TV market with an Intel-branded set-top box . `` It is a great device and has great technology , but at the end of the day [ it ] is about the content you get on there , '' Krzanich told Re/code . Intel 's set-top box efforts are n't likely to become vaporware , as the chip maker is said to be talking to Verizon to offload its TV product . Instead of playing up the TV angle , Intel is poised to develop technology that it thinks the market will be demanding several years from now . People may be interested is wearable technology soon , but the market is already crowded . Wearables with big players behind them range from the Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch to Fitbit Force activity wristband to Google Glass , all vying for wrist and face space . We 'll have a clearer picture of where Intel will fit in the wearable world come next week .

Michael DeCesare , president of Intel Security , has moved to defend his company 's McAfee Antivirus software from those who think it is a lame duck against a new generation of viruses . DeCesare , who leads the company formerly known as McAfee , claims that large existing players like Intel would dominate the fast-growing sector . This flies in the face of those who see investors flooding to fund newer companies such as FireEye and Palo Alto Networks . David De Walt , FireEye chief executive who used to head up McAfee , has been vocal about how his company offers a better solution to combat increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals . Of course , he would say that and the AV industry is historically good at slagging each other off . DeCesare however said that McAfee was not close to antivirus being old technology and challenged someone to come up with a company that has de-installed antivirus because they have FireEye . But the fact he is commenting does indicate a big problem for the older security companies like McAfee and Symantec who are getting challenged by younger companies . DeCesare acknowledged that FireEye was doing well but he said it would be interesting to see over time if they are able to keep to that very small area of security . Eventually he thinks that the market will be owned by large companies that does not specialise in cybersecurity such as Intel - which bought McAfee in 2010 - IBM , and Dell . He told the FT that Intel Security will dominate the growing cybersecurity industry by embedding its security on the Intel chips which are used in everything from computers to the nascent 'internet of things ' , internet-connected devices from fridges to thermostats that are particularly vulnerable to attack . Intel Security is also targeting the nascent privacy market , which has been spurred by the Edward Snowden revelations of a US mass surveillance programme .
Intel has published a number of benchmarks that shed a positive light on its new Merrifield platform . The successor to Clovertrail+ combines two high-speed cores with what the company calls the world 's smallest LTE solution . Three of the benchmarks are carried out on the XPRT 2013 suite and Intel makes it clear that it is a sponsor , member and major developer of the BenchmarkXPRT development community . On WebXPRT 2013 , which evaluates performance on a series of web applications , the reference design smartphone came out slightly ahead of the A7 and more than twice as fast as the Qualcomm Snapdragon found in the Galaxy S4 LTE-A . Intel 's Z3480 surpassed the same system on chip , albeit by a smaller margin on the next benchmark application , the MobileXPRT 2013 , which performs light media editing but is only available on Android . As for battery life , BatteryXPRT , the third benchmark app , puts Merrifield atop others with a claimed battery life of more than 19 hours , ahead of both Qualcomm and Apple while using a lower capacity battery . The last benchmark mentioned was GFXBench 2.7 where Intel 's chip was competitive on 3D gaming , coming slightly behind Qualcomm 's Snapdragon 800 . The most exciting feature though is the promise of 64-bit Android , one which is likely to bring up to a third extra performance when deployed , although it is very much application dependent . Oddly enough , the Intel reference phone used an unannounced Z3770 processor which has two cores clocked at 2.13GHz and a whopping 2MB L2 cache as well as a 4-inch HD display . It is surprising though that Intel did n't put the quad-core version of Merrifield ( Moorefield ) to the test . Earlier today , Intel also announced a new LTE chip at MWC , the XMM 7260 , which supports download speeds of up to 300Mbps .
Intel showed its mobile ambitions at MWC 2014 by launching a new processor range called Merrifield and a variant called Moorefield . Two stock keeping units ( SKUs , or versions of the chip ) will be available , the Z3480 and the Z3580 . Both replace the Clover Trail+ platform as the company 's flagship mobile platform and are 64-bit compatible . Clover Trail+ had limited prospects in a crowded mobile market going up against competing processors in the form of the Lenovo 's K900 , and others from the likes of Samsung , Asus and Dell . Merrifield uses a smaller node at 22nm ( compared to 32nm ) , meaning it should use less power and extend the battery life of any device it finds itself in . The dual-core Z3480 SoC ( system-on-a-chip ) can reach clock speeds of up to 2.13GHz with 1MB shared L2 cache while implementing what it calls a `` new micro architecture with OOO execution '' called Silvermont . It comes with the LTE-capable XMM 7160 baseband modem that can reach download speeds of up to 150Mbps . Intel added the much sought-after support for up to 4GB LPDDR3 memory , a move that will drastically improve performance and reduce power consumption on Merrifield devices . Graphics is another sub-system that gets a significant boost with an upgrade to a quad cluster PowerVR G6400 GPU ( AKA Rogue ) , similar to what lies inside the Apple A7 SoC on the iPhone 5S . That upgrade allows the new platform to deliver up to twice the graphics performance compared to the previous generation . Also in the mix are a next-generation image signal processor as well as a dedicated programmable video signal processor that can encode and decode at 1080p ( and 60 frames per second ) . The higher-end SKU , the Z3580 , also known as Moorefield , adds two extra cores , bumps the clock speed to 2.3GHz , adds support for 800MHz LDPDDR3 memory and swaps the G6400 GPU for the G6430 . Another worthy addition is Intel 's integrated sensor solution - a low-power hardware subsystem that allows the SoC to deliver contextual information to apps without the need for additional hardware . The company mentions motion and gesture sensing , audio sensing , location sensing and contextual analyses , and examples of potential apps include life visualisation , device personalisation and predictive assistant . Intel also announced a new LTE chip at MWC , the XMM 7260 , one that supports download speeds of up to 300Mbps .
Intel has introduced a new baseband modem called the XMM 7260 , its third , only three years into its LTE programme . This is a significant improvement on last year ’ s LTE-capable XMM 7160 which was featured alongside an Intel processor on Samsung ’ s Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 , the first major win for the Santa Clara-based semiconductor manufacturer . The new modem will supports downstream speeds of up to 300Mbps as a CAT 6 platform and is a one-solution chip ( or single chip , multi-mode RF transceiver as Intel puts it ) . Networks globally are deploying CAT 6 technology which means that more LTE-Advanced announcements can be expected in 2014 . Intel is pitching it as a product that can deliver Carrier Aggregation ( CA ) on one piece of silicon . More specifically , it can offer up to 23 CA combinations and is flexible up to 40MHz , something which reduces dramatically the opportunity and real costs of implementing LTE in any given design . CA allows operators to gather additional bandwidth for higher data transfer rates or to use the disperse spectrum in a more effective way to boost download speeds . The XMM 7260 also supports more than 30 3GPP bands , 22 bands simultaneously on one SKU and all major global modes ( LTE FDD/TDD , WDCMA/HSPA+ , TD-SCDMA/TD-HSPA/EDGE ) . Intel expects the first products based around that new SKU to be launched within weeks with traditional partners like Lenovo ( and Motorola ) , Asus and Dell likely to adopt this solution .

Many of us have blood in our hardware . From MP3 players to laptops and smartphones , lots of devices include 'conflict minerals ' . You 've probably heard of blood diamonds , gems mined by warlords to finance bloodshed . When gold , tin , tantalum and tungsten are produced in similar circumstances , they 're conflict minerals . The minerals play an essential role in many products . Tantalum is used in capacitors and in tooling , tin in solder , gold in circuit boards and tungsten in mobile phones . One of the most important sources of those minerals is the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , where more than 5 million people have been killed in the last decade by armed groups . Many of those groups are funded by the profits from mineral extraction . Many tech firms are trying to change that , and Intel is at the forefront . In January , Intel CEO Brian Krzanich introduced a sombre video about conflict minerals at CES , and promised that the firm 's future processors would be conflict-free . In February , Apple published its latest supplier responsibility report and noted that for the very first time , it could verify that none of the tantalum used in its products came from mines in conflict regions . Problem solved ? Not quite . Cleaning up technology is n't as simple as firms changing suppliers . Organisations such as the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition ( EICC ) believe that electronics firms ' money can help the Congo move towards peace . The trick , they believe , is for firms to continue doing business with the DRC without financing the warlords . The problem is that minerals ' origins can be exceptionally hard to trace , as there are multiple links in the supply chain between the mines and the technology firms that use the minerals . However , that does n't mean the problem ca n't be addressed . As Apple VP of operations Jeff Williams told the Financial Times `` the smelters are a choke point all this flows through '' . If you can identify and audit conflict-free smelters , you can reasonably claim that your products are conflict-free . Bandi Mbubi , director of Congo Calling , campaigns for conflict-free technology . `` Intel and Apple lead the way for consumer electronics in the ethical sourcing of materials from conflict-affected countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo , '' he told us . He has particular praise for Intel , which is `` the only technology company to date to claim to be completely conflict-free . '' Apple has some catching up to do , as `` it can only account for its tantalum as completely conflict-free , '' Mbubi explains . `` Its tungsten , tin and gold are still in part being sourced from non-compliant smelters .

Dell has built a new high-speed server designed for workhorse applications such as enterprise resource planning , e-commerce and databases . The PowerEdge R920 it is Dells first to use Intel 's new E7 processors . According to Dell , the PowerEdge R920 is a 4-socket 4U server that claims to deliver the same performance as the previous generation 8-socket server but with some interesting technology under the bonnet . The R920 has 8 PCIe Express Flash drives , a H730P PowerEdge RAID controller that doubles cache size and the ability to maximize performance based on the available solid-state drives . The server has up to 6 TB of memory and up to 24 local storage drives . Dell is claiming many world records for processing times . It managed a world record 4-socket Linux benchmark result of 24,150 benchmark users on the SAP SD 2-Tier benchmark and a 71 per cent improved performance over the previous best E7-4800 4-socket SAP SD benchmark . On Oracle workloads , the server could process more than twice the number of Oracle OLAP queries than with previous generation server configurations . The system depends on running up to 60 cores of processing power and using things like eight high performance , ultra-low latency PCIe Express Flash drives . The server also uses the new H730P PowerEdge RAID controller ( PERC ) that Dell claims doubles the previous cache size and delivers up to 100 per cent more IOPS performance , and the dual PERC capacity that lets customers maximize performance across the larger number of available solid state drives ( SSDs ) .

Intel has released new details about its upcoming 15-core Xeon processors designed for use with x86 servers . The new chips , codenamed Ivytown , boast three more cores than the Xeon E5 v2 processors it released towards the end of last year . They feature 4.31 billion transistors and are expected to work with 4-socket or 8-socket servers , the reserve of high-end enterprise computing . Each core can run 30 threads at once . Speeds will range from 1.4GHz to 3.8GHz , while power consumption will be between 40 Watts and 150 Watts . It is not clear why Intel decided to go for 15 cores instead of 16 , which is the next logical step up from previous 8-core and 12-core releases . Reports suggest that Intel is working on 18-core processors . Long-time rival AMD has been releasing 16-core processors since 2011 . In January it added new 12-core and 16-core server processors to its Opteron 6300 Series . In 2012 it cancelled its planned 10-core and 20-core range . Intel 's new Ivytown processors are expected to be formally announced next week . Via PCWorld

Why would you make a PC the size of a postage stamp ? Because there are so many places to stick it that ARM has had to itself . There are plenty of processors to use in wearable devices and the tiny new devices that will make up the Internet of Things . Most of them come from ARM , with embedded controllers based on older architectures like MIPS tending to show up in larger devices like network video cameras or set-top boxes . If you want a processor small enough to fit in a cable or a razor , you 'd use an ARM chip ; Schick uses an ARM chip to control the motor that makes its razors vibrate at the right frequency to make your hairs stand on end so you get a cleaner shave . By contrast , the tiny PC featuring its Mullins processor AMD showed at CES this year was the size of a smartphone , about the same size as the Galileo PC board Intel had for developers last year . In the past we 've seen PCs that would fit in a matchbox , or about the same size as a Raspberry Pi . Edison , developed in Intel 's Beijing research labs , is far smaller . The whole PC is the size of an SD card ; the low power DDR2 memory is stacked on top of the 22nm CPU ( that 's the Quark SoC ) , the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE radios are next to it with the flash storage , and when you flip it over it has the same SDIO connector as any other SD card so you can put it in a PC to program it . It also has a SIM connection so you can get data to and from an Edison device that way too , and it has pins for the standard low-power buses used in many devices ( GPIO , UART , I2C , SPI and PWM ) . What you get is a dual-core processor that Intel calls Pentium class ; we 'd call it sub-Atom ( in fact the Quark name might be a joking reference to that , as quarks are sub-atomic particles ) . The low-power core runs an Intel real-time OS that can handle the basics of keeping a device running , the other runs Linux – and Intel already has software from Mathematica that can run on that . That was probably much easier to get onto Edison because , underneath , it 's a familiar PC . The beauty of Edison is that Linux developers who are used to writing code for PCs get a very familiar programming model , which will simplify writing drivers for all the sensors you might want to build into a wearable device as well as opening up hardware development to developers who do n't have experience with real-time systems ( which are usually much harder to work with than more forgiving x86 code ) . But they also get the low power you expect from an embedded processor . `` It uses 1W when it 's on , '' Randy Wang from Intel Labs China told us , `` but it 's under 250 mW if you only have the small core running to keep it alive . '' So when just the sensors are active , the power use is low ; when they sense something you want the device to react to , the Linux core wakes up and does the work . In the future , he promised , `` it will go a lot lower '' . He 's bullish about Edison compared to other options . `` The others that are as small do n't have the same capability , in terms of DRAM and CPU . The others that can do as much are bigger or run hotter . '' The team has big plans for adding more features to Edison . It does n't have hardware codecs like H.264 today ( which saves a lot of power for video playback ) but they 'll come in time , Wang told us . The plan was to get the first model out quickly and then start adding extras – and shrinking the device . `` In the next couple of years we will integrate the radio more . The storage can become phase change memory in the SoC , which also acts as DRAM . In a number of years , this will just be a single chip . And in a few years the SD size will be micro SD . '' That means the baby monitor that Rest Devices showed at CES wo n't have to double as a baby toy in case the child pulls it off their onesie and starts sucking on it ; it can be small enough to be sewn into the label ( although you might not want to wash it ) and easily small enough to fit into the coffee cup that changes colour to show you if your child is running a fever . Of course ARM chips and the rest will be getting smaller as well , but at that size , Intel has a shot at taking a share in the Internet of Things .

Intel has revealed some of its latest research projects at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference in San Francisco , including an energy-efficient graphics core , and a 256-node network-on-chip . First up is the 22nm graphics execution core , with adaptive clocking to help mitigate the impact of fast voltage droops , selective boosting for low-voltage operation of embedded register file and ROM arrays , and state-retentive sleep , which provides 10 times the leakage savings of previous chips . The chip boasts substantial power savings , with a 2.7 times boost of gigaflops/Watt operation at near-threshold voltage , and 1.4 times higher peak gigaflops/Watt . This chip is expected to target the mobile and handheld device sector , where achieving optimum energy efficiency remains a cat and mouse game . Intel is also working on a new 256-node source-synchronous network-on-chip , partly funded by the US government . This technology is designed to provide an interconnect fabric for future many-core processors . The chip giant boasts inter-core communication bandwidth at a whopping 20.2Tb/s , with 18.3Tb/s energy efficiency at 430mV NTV and a low voltage option at 340mV , nine times lower than nominal voltage . This chip is aimed at the big guns of computing : supercomputers and exascale machines that need hundreds of compute nodes . Both projects are still in the research and development stage , so it may be some time before they hit the market . Via TechReport and The Register

Wearable technology still has some way to go before it adds any meaning to our lives , according to Intel . Speaking at the Wearable Technology Show in London , Intel Futurist Steve Brown said that wearable tech is undeniably the future , but developers need to think more carefully about how it will benefit us day to day . `` Just having great technology is not going to be enough , '' said Brown . `` A lot of the wearables that have come out to date are failing because they do n't do that additional work . `` It 's not just about form , fit and fashion , '' he said , but added that adding personalisation will still be key . `` We need to ask what this technology connects people to… thinking about how to personalise and add meaning to these wearables is going to be key , '' Brown said . `` Wearables will only be successful when they do things that people really care about '' An example he gave was a wearable device that would allow a parent to remotely monitor the health of a sleeping baby and would automatically send a signal to a kitchen device to warm some milk if needed . Brown said he believed that in ten years ' time anything and everything could become a computer , from shoes to coffee cups .

Intel has developed a new type of optical cable that looks set to replace higher-grade copper types used to transfer data between data centres . Detailed in a company blog post , new MXC cables use light and lasers to move data between servers , storage , networking and other resources at 800Gbps , far outpacing the 10Gbps ones commonly used today . MXC cables are smaller , more durable and resistant than copper ones and boast a longer range of up to 300 metres , according to Intel . The company reckons that cloud and big data companies will be among the first to express interest in the tech . Each cable can have a maximum of 64 fibres , and each fibre can transfer data at 25Gbps . The new tech could change the way servers are designed . Optical light speeds mean that differing components of a server could be connected via expansion boxes , while the hyperspeed transfer rates may benefit supercomputing and database applications . Intel is opening the tech to companies , and it 's working alongside the Facebook-sponsored Open Compute Project . Backers for the new connector include Microsoft and Huawei .

Intel will bring its smart home gateway to the market very soon , according to Christian Morales , the company 's vice President and General Manager EMEA revealed during a press conference at the CeBIT 2014 expo . The company partnered with Taiwan-based ODM Hitron to deliver its first smart home gateway , one based on the Puma 6 , an Atom based system-on-chip that runs at 1.2GHz . The device ran four different home servers ( Home Automation , Home Security , Entertainment and Energy Efficiency ) at the same time in a running demo . Comcast was the first service provider in the US to use Intel 's smart home gateway solution back in June 2013 , which was built by Cisco . The Puma 6 SoC adheres to DOSCIS 3.0 , allowing it to reach up to 1.32Gbps downstream speed by combining 24 DOCSIS channels and up to 320Mbps upload ( using EuroDOCSIS ) . It also offers hardware-based virtualisation , MOCA compatibility as well as wired and dual-band wireless MIMO connectivity . This level of versatility is one of the reasons why utility companies such as MVV Energy AG in Germany are evaluating the unit for decentralised energy management within the home .

Intel has swooped in and bought Basis Science , maker of the Basis Health Tracker Watch . The company was rumoured to be shopping itself around and word recently emerged that Apple , Google and others were all interested in buying it , but now we 're hearing that Intel made the winning bid . According to sources speaking to TechCrunch , the deal was done for $ 100 million , while another said the sum was closer to $ 150 million . Google was rumoured to be in talks for a sub- $ 100 million buyout , so it sounds as though Intel came in and made Basis an offer it could n't refuse . It 's no surprise that Basis would have a few suitors . Its Health Tracker Watch is packed with health-monitoring functions such as heart rate and motion sensors , sleep tracking and temperature reading . Apple is rumoured to be making 2014 all about fitness , with whispers of the iWatch and iOS 8 having a lot of focus on health . Less is known about the possible Google watch , but if Mountain View is up to something , you can bet it will have some sort of health element . Intel recently told TechRadar that it has a lot of interest in wearable tech and its role in the Internet of Things . It also showed off a number of wearable devices at CES 2014 . We 've contacted Intel to ask for confirmation on the buyout , and will update when we hear more .

Acer has announced the Iconia One 7 tablet , which packs in a sharper screen than its very recent B1-720 . Acer 's also upping the speed by putting in a Intel Atom Z2560 processor , along with 1GB of RAM . The tablet ships with Android 4.2 , but that can be upgraded to KitKat . However it 's the inclusion of an Intel processor at an affordable price point that 's got us interested in this slab - especially as prices will start at $ 130 in the US this May . We expect other countries will get it soon after . Finally , it 'll offer seven hours of battery life and comes in 10 available colours - because a bit of choice never hurt anyone . That was n't all from the tablets though . Acer also announced the Iconia Tab 7 , which rocks an aluminium chassis and a 1280 x 800 display . It does n't quite match the One 7 in power though as Acer has opted for a quad-core Mediatek processor instead . But most intriguingly , it offers up 3G connectivity for anyone who really fancies using it as a phone .

Intel 's new Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt interface is getting ready to strap on its skis and clock up some serious speed on the data slopes - up to 40Gb/s - according to a leaked slide for the design . The image , revealed by VR-Zone , shows an increase of twice the bandwidth compared to existing Falcon Ridge Thunderbolt chips , which are already a big improvement over USB 3.0 . While speeds are set to go up , power usage is set to go down . The Alpine Ridge model touts a 50 per cent reduction in power consumption over current versions . The chipset will come in four modes : TBT , DP 1.2 , USB 3.0 , and HDMI 2.0 via LSPCon . It will support PCI-e gen3 , and will come with two SKUs , a 4C dual port connector for daisy-chaining , and an LP single port connector . The connector itself will be revamped , allowing system charging up to 100W , higher bandwidth , a slightly smaller form factor , and room for backwards compatibility adapters . The slide also highlights the intended use for supporting two 4K displays simultaneously , while also providing some system charging functionality . Alpine Ridge is expected to launch in 2015 , along with Intel 's next generation of processors . Via Bit-tech

Intel has released its latest financial report for the first quarter of 2014 , with lower revenue and net income than last year . The chip giant brought in a total of $ 12.8 billion ( £7.6 billion , AU $ 13.6 billion ) revenue for the first three months of the year , a decline of 8 per cent compared to the $ 13.8 billion ( £8.2 billion , AU $ 14.7 billion ) it earned in the first quarter of 2013 . Operating income came in at $ 2.5 billion ( £1.5 billion , AU $ 2.7 billion ) , down 29 per cent . Net income was $ 1.9 billion ( £1.1 billion , AU $ 2 billion ) , a drop of five per cent year-on-year . The company 's PC Client Group posted revenue of $ 7.9 billion ( £4.7 billion , AU $ 8.4 billion ) , eight per cent down on the previous quarter and one per cent down on the previous year . The mild year-on-year decline suggests a stabilisation in this vital sector , which makes up the majority of Intel 's revenue . Data Centre Group revenue was $ 3.1 billion ( £1.8 billion , AU $ 3.3 billion ) , down five per cent sequentially , but up 11 per cent on 2013 . The mobile sector was one of the worst for Intel , with revenue of just $ 156 million ( £93 million , AU $ 166 million ) in its Mobile and Communications Group , a staggering drop of 52 per cent on the previous quarter and 61 per cent on the first quarter of last year . The Internet of Things Group performed much better , with revenue of $ 482 million ( £287 million , AU $ 514 million ) . This was a 10 per cent sequential drop , but a 32 per cent increase on 2013 . Likewise , Software and Services brought in $ 533 million ( £317 million , AU $ 569 million ) , down 6 per cent sequentially and up 6 per cent year-on-year . `` In the first quarter we saw solid growth in the data center , signs of improvement in the PC business , and we shipped 5 million tablet processors , making strong progress on our goal of 40 million tablets for 2014 , '' said Brian Krzanich , CEO of Intel . The year ahead should see Intel focus on hybrid devices catering for the lower end of the market , adding to its existing push for Chromebook clamshell models . `` We 're now expecting more than 70 two-in-one designs for the back-to-school selling season and many will be offered at $ 699 or less . These trends , in combination with renewed interest in Windows 8 from our customers , are encouraging , '' Krzanich said in his earnings call . He also revealed plans for more than 130 Atom-based laptop and desktop designs for the affordable market .
New financial postings show that Intel has been losing billions of dollars on its Mobile and Communications Group over the last few years . The division , which includes Bluetooth , GPS , wi-fi and and cellular connectivity , along with its mobile processors , has seen the company lose a about US $ 3.15 billion ( about £1.88 billion , AU $ 3.36 billion ) in 2013 . The first quarter of 2014 has n't proven much better for the division , with Intel posting an operating lost of US $ 929 million . The company has also seen large losses in its PC and Data Centre Groups - US $ 2.8 billion ( about £1.67 billion , AU $ 3 billion ) and US $ 1.3 billion ( about £780 million , AU $ 1.4 billion ) , respectively , in the first quarter of 2014 alone . But while the figures look grim for the company , Intel 's fledgling Internet of Things Group has reported sales profits of nearly half a million each quarter . The company also has new processors it showcased at Mobile World Congress earlier this year that support LTE and purported download speeds of 300Mbps , which should help it take on rival Qualcomm . There 's also Intel 's tiny PC , Edison , to look forward to as well . Via : The Verge

Intel has a plan to take computers and completely submerge them in liquid to create the best cooling solution ever . Beyond a water-cooled heat sink , Intel and 3M ( yes , the company that makes scotch tape ) announced they 've been working with SGI to create a completely liquid-based cooling system . The result is a system that completely immerses supercomputers in liquid to cool them more efficiently and cheaply . As a proof of concept , the companies have built and dropped a supercomputer powered by Intel Xenon chips into a tank of Novec , a dielectric , non-conductive liquid developed by 3M . While liquids and PCs do n't usually mix , this solution did n't conduct electricity so the components continued to work as usual . The big advantage of such a liquid cooled system is fluids can pull heat away from processors and GPUs much more efficiently than air . Intel claims the technology has the potential to slash data-center energy bills by 95 % . Novec is already being used in fire suppressions systems but now Intel and SGI are experimenting with its capacity to cool computers . If everything works out Novec could be used to replace the system of fans and gallons of water currently used keep data centers chilled . Of course , liquid cooling is n't without its drawbacks . One of the biggest challenges is designing new motherboards and servers to take the submersion . Companies also need to redesign rack-level interconnects since the Novec solution might affect the way light passes through optical connection cables . A liquid cooling solution also poses problems for regular maintenance as the system needs to completely drain out before an engineer can open it up and get to the components . It 's hurdles like these that have prevented liquid submersion cooling from taking off outside of PC enthusiasts dunking their motherboards in mineral oil . It 's unlikely completely liquid cooled PCs will show up at Best Buy anytime soon . But for IT solution companies , Novec could solve a big space problem for data centers , where there might not be enough room for efficient airflow in server rooms . Via IT World

Intel has teamed up with 3M and SGI to deliver an advanced cooling technology that can reduce data centre cooling costs by as much as 95 per cent . As a proof-of-concept , the trio developed a supercomputer that uses a new two-phase immersion cooling technology spearheaded by 3M . The project combines SGI 's ICE X distributed memory supercomputer with Intel Xeon E5-2600 processors placed directly in 3M 's Novec Engineered Fluid . This fluid acts as an efficient dielectric , cooling hardware without the need for municipal water that is typically used in evaporative cooling . The result is a staggering 95 per cent reduction in cooling energy costs , a significant reduction in water consumption , and a 10 times reduction in required space compared to conventional air cooling . If that was not enough , heat generated from the system can even be harvested and reused to heat other technologies like desalination of sea water . `` As the backbone of the data economy , modern data centers must increase the raw performance they deliver , but also do so efficiently by containing power consumption and operating costs , '' said Charles Wuishpard , VP of the Data Center Group and GM of Workstation and High Performance Computing at Intel . `` Intel is continually innovating and improving microprocessor technologies to meet today 's datacenter demands and is working with companies like 3M and SGI to explore advanced cooling technologies that improve energy efficiency in datacenters while also containing operating costs .

One of the highlights of the first day of Build 2014 was the piano demonstration where Microsoft used an Intel-based solution to power a piano . That solution used a Galileo board with a Quark chip onboard . What was even more spectacular was that it was running the Windows 8.1 Kernel , as demonstrated on stage by Microsoft 's Terry Myerson . TechRadar Pro can reveal that this Quark chip was an X1000 , a P3-class , 32-bit , x86 processor clocked at 400MHz . Getting a new operating system to run on such limited resources ( we 're talking of a CPU similar to a 15 year-old model ) is a genuine feat , a real credit to the job done by Microsoft 's engineers and developers . It costs less than $ 10 , has a TDP of 2.2w , 16KB cache and is a full system-on-a-chip about the size of a pencil eraser ( with 512KB embedded ECC-protected SRAM ) . In comparison , the Intel Celeron 400MHz had 128KB cache but a max TDP of 22W . Intel launched it in a bid to capture a slice of the Internet of Things market , which is essentially embedded solution and dominated by ARM and its partners . Joe Belfiore also announced that Windows for Internet of Things will be available for free . It is not known whether this will be a new SKU or whether Microsoft will use that term interchangeably with Windows Embedded ( 8 or Compact ) . Windows 8.1 update 1 is now out and available for download .
Intel has announced a new 14nm processor designed for smaller form factor devices , in addition to a further push to get Google Chromebooks out into the wild . Kirk Skaugen , SVP and GM of the PC Client Group at Intel , unveiled the chip giant 's PC plans in his keynote address at this year 's Intel Developer Forum in Shenzhen , China . The new chip , codenamed Braswell , well be an Atom-based microarchitecture catering for the entry-level market . The aim is to lower building material costs and improve performance , but we have no details yet on its spec . Intel is going all in with Chromebook , with more than 20 new designs planned for this year alone . This is part of a push to bring `` thin PC '' costs down as low as $ 199 ( £120 , AU $ 215 ) . `` In the value clamshell space , we 're now aggressively supporting Chrome around the world . Last year we had only four designs on Chrome . Today I can announce that this year we 'll have over 20 designs on Chrome as that becomes a more important operating system around the world , '' Skaugen said . The affordability of Chromebooks has helped sales grow significantly over the last year , despite an overall dip in PC growth . Via PC World

Intel is launching a $ 100 million ( £60 million , AU $ 110 million ) fund aimed at strengthening ties with Chinese manufacturers and ensuring that its chips will be prominent in the country 's future device development . In a statement , Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that through Intel 's new `` Capital China Smart Device Innovation Fund '' the industry landscape in China will undergo rapid transformation . Intel , he said , can re-ignite growth in the Shenzhen technology ecosystem . As part of the fund , a research and development center will be built in the South China-based city , focusing on wearables , web-connected devices , the Internet of Things , hybrids and mobile tech . The center will , according to Krzanich , act as a bridge between product conception and commercial deployment . A team from the centre will work with local businesses and promote the use of Intel products and chips , including the Edison research platform and Gateway Solutions for the Internet of Things . `` The China technology ecosystem will be instrumental in the transformation of computing , '' said Krzanich . `` To help drive global innovation , Intel will stay focused on delivering leadership products and technologies that not only allow our partners to rapidly innovate , but also deliver on the promise that 'if it computes , it does it best with Intel . ' '' Since 1998 Intel has invested more than $ 670 million ( £402 million , AU $ 724 million ) in China , spread over 110 companies and two investment funds .
Chipmaker Intel is rallying some key industry names behind its 100G CLR4 photonic communication technology which it claims will revolutionize the data center . The technology aims to cure a problem that large data centers have moving high bandwidth across longer lengths of fibre cable . Intel has formed a 100G CLR4 Alliance with members including Arista , Brocade , Dell , Ebay , HP , and Oclaro . The idea is that the Alliance will create an open specification for a cost-effective , low-power 100G CWDM optical link with a reach of up to 2km . Mario Paniccia , Intel fellow and general manager of the Silicon Photonics Solutions Group , said that there needs to be industry-wide specifications or standards that ultimately make things work better together and more importantly , drive down costs . He said that this would help growth of the data center industry . Paniccia said that photonic communication was a great way to move data in a data center as they become massive and need longer reaches for connectivity . `` Optical has the known benefits of moving data further than electrical links , transmitting data faster and not being affected by electro-magnetic interference . As we move from 10Gbps to 25Gbps signaling , optical communication becomes even more important , '' Paniccia said . There are telecom centric optical transceivers operating at 100Gbps , but their power , size and costs are non-starters for the new data center . `` There is a huge gap that needs to be filled for reaches that span from say 100m to 2km . And that 's the problem we are trying to address here , '' Paniccia said . Andy Bechtolsheim , founder , chairman , and chief development officer of Arista Networks said that the alliance will speed up the industry 's ability to make cost effective low-power , 100G CRL4 QSFP form factor optics that address the 2km reach requirements of large data center customers .

Intel 's highly-anticipated Edison miniature PC is set to get a new design and features as the chip giant prepares to take on the wearable technology and Internet of Things ( IoT ) markets . The computer , which was unveiled at CES in January , will use Intel 's 22nm Silvermont dual-core Atom System-on-Chip ( SoC ) , instead of the previously-planned Quark SoC . The dual threaded CPU will clock in at 500MHz , will feature an additional MCU , and will have 30 I/O interfaces via a small 70-pin connector . The overall design has also been revamped . Instead of aiming for the SD card form factor , Intel will make the chip slightly larger , which it said will increase durability and lower costs . It is possible the previously announced SD form factor was too cost prohibitive . The switch from Quark to Atom will give the computer a bit more bang for buck , but it does take away a little from the charm of the device . Intel is also adding additional I/O and software support , including Arduino IDE , Wolfram Language , Yocto Linux , Node.js , and Python . This is in addition to its existing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE support . Intel said it is accelerating its plans with Edison to take advantage of market opportunities . The IoT market is set to be worth $ 7.3 trillion ( £4.4 trillion , AU $ 8.2 trillion ) by 2017 , according to IDC . The wearable technology market is also expected to boom . Edison is planned to launch this summer .

Intel has announced plans to invade the automotive market with the help of a new range of products , part of its in-vehicle solutions platform . The plan , Intel said , was to accelerate innovation towards a future of autonomous vehicles through a standardized platform approach that worked well in computing . It seeks to shorten the time it takes to develop IVI ( In-Vehicle Infotainment ) systems by one year while halving associated costs of development . In parallel , Intel unveiled a project aimed at gathering data about how drivers interact with their cars and immediate environment ( including other drivers and pedestrians ) . The company 's corporate vice president for the Internet-of-things group , Doug Davis , added `` Our goal is to fuel the evolution from convenience features available in the car today to enhanced safety features of tomorrow and eventually self-driving capabilities . '' The news coincided with Google 's launch of a range of self-driving , quasi-sentient cars that could revolutionise transport .

Most wearables are smart gadgets that can be worn , but Intel wants to take it one step further by smartening up our clothes . That , and let consumers create customizable robots using 3D printing . Intel revealed its kooky visions for the future at the 2014 Code Conference , where its smart shirt and 3D-printed robots stood under the same spotlight that also illuminated Google 's new self-driving cars and Microsoft 's near-real-time translation software this week . Intel CEO Brian Krzanich took the stage at Code Conference wearing a `` smart shirt '' covered in sensors for monitoring heart rate , emotions and more . He said the sensors can communicate with a smartphone app , according to Engadget . And while Intel is only building the sensors - not the shirt itself - Krzanich said the company 's vision includes `` eyes , ears , wrist and torso '' wearables , not just shirts . Intel expects to launch the smart shirt this summer . Meanwhile Intel also unveiled a customizable 3D-printed robot that it plans to bring to market by the end of 2014 starting at $ 1,600 ( about £960 , AU $ 1,735 ) on 21stCenturyRobot.com , according to Re/code . That money will get you a kit that includes elements that ca n't be 3D printed , like wires , batteries and processors . But the rest of the robot will be 3D printed , and the schematics will be available freely online . Intel Futurist Brian David Johnson debuted his custom version of the robot , named Jimmy , at Code Conference . Jimmy danced and tweeted , among other things . The low-cost consumer version runs on an Intel Edison chip , but a $ 16,000 ( about £9,575 , AU $ 17,350 ) version with an Intel i5 will reportedly also go on sale . It 's also open source , so developers can create their own `` apps '' to run on the robot , letting users customize their robots like smartphones . So get ready for a resurgence of highly advanced fart-noise apps .
Intel has announced that it 's entering a strategic partnership with fabless Chinese company Rockchip to `` accelerate '' and `` expand '' its family of Intel-based solutions for tablets . This hints at a change in strategy from Intel who may well be looking to reduce its dependency on Microsoft 's Windows and look towards Android to fuel future growth . The two companies will work towards delivering a new quad-core Atom-based part with integrated 3G modem , as part of Intel 's SoFIA family , with the first parts expected to appear as early as H1 2015 . It will primarily target entry-level , value-focused tablets but not smartphones - probably because of the higher power envelope of the first SoFIA generation . More granular details of the agreement have yet to be disclosed but it is likely to involve Rockchip 's own network of Asian partners and access to its inhouse design team . Whether or not manufacturers and users will be convinced by the value of an integrated modem will be an interesting evolution to watch . Unlike smartphones , 3G connectivity is not compulsory and 3G versions of tablets have always retailed at a significant premium compared to their Wi-Fi counterparts . Rockchip is one of the better-known fabless ARM-based system on chip designers based in China , which is why Intel 's announcement is both puzzling and intriguing . Others include Nufront , AllWinner , VIA , AMLogic and Mediatek , the biggest and best known of them and the only one of the lot that can offer a complete SoC solution to match SoFIA .

The number of Avoton-based motherboards is growing with Gigabyte being the latest manufacturer to add to a list that also counts Supermicro and Asrock . Its GA-9SISL was announced yesterday and packs a lot of punch . Launched last year , the Intel 's 8-core Atom C2750 processor that powers it packs 8 threads and runs at up to 2.6GHz . It has a maximum TDP of only 20W ( which explains why it needs just a tiny heatsink fan ) and 4MB L2 cache . The Taiwanese manufacturer made a lot of effort to pack as much as possible into a tiny surface area . This mini-ITX board offers four full size memory slots that can accommodate ECC memory modules , four GbE LAN ports ( plus an extra management LAN ) , Aspeed AST2400 remote management , a PCIe x16 slot and six SATA ports ( two SATA-3 ones ) , RAID support ( courtesy of Intel ) . Gigabyte clearly highlighted its niche status by opting for a serial connector , a VGA port and two USB 2.0 ports , also note the absence of any audio capabilities . Do n't expect the motherboard to be cheap though ; the Asrock C2750d4i , a similar motherboard launched earlier this year , costs about £350 . Gigabyte also announced a number of other Intel-based Xeon server motherboards ( both 1P and 2P ) as well as a 2U , 4-node rackmount system .

Intel has promised to deliver its next-generation processors , codenamed Broadwell , in time for the Christmas holidays . Brian Krzanich , CEO of Intel , spoke to Reuters at the Maker Faire in San Mateo , California , where he committed to delivering PCs with the new chips for the festive season . `` I can guarantee for holiday , and not at the last second of holiday , '' Krzanich said . `` Back to school - that 's a tight one . Back to school you have to really have it on-shelf in July , August . That 's going to be tough . '' The comments suggest that the chip giant is targeting somewhere around October or early November , which would be just shy of the back-to-school season , but gives enough time to take full advantage of the pre-Christmas shopping season , when many technology companies make the majority of their profit . Krzanich pledged a second half of 2014 release for the new chips in the last quarterly conference call in April , and it seems that Intel is well on target to keep that promise . The Broadwell chip was already delayed from a 2013 release , but it may be worth the wait . It promises enhanced performance , lower power consumption , and a smaller form-factor . Via Hexus

Asus may be preparing a powerful Android tablet braying with Intel 's energy-efficient Bay Trail T processor . The Asus MeMO Pad 7 ME176C was picked up by Mobile Geeks , and it looks to have packed heavy with the four-core Atom Z3745 SoC . Sticking with Android 4.4 , the slate appears to be a thin slab that still packs a 1.33GHz punch . It supposedly tips the scale at 295 grams and have a width of 9.6mm . In addition to specs , the German site also snagged a pair of images of the new MeMO Pad 7 , with the front visible below . The new MeMO 's specs do n't stop with Bay Trail . The new Asus tablet is pegged to ship with a 7-inch IPS display home to a 1280 x 800 resolution . RAM is settled at 1GB and internal storage comes in either 8GB or 16GB . A microSD slot will provide an expandable storage option . A 2MP camera is positioned on the front while a 5MP ( sans flash ) sits on the back . The MeMO Pad 7 ME176C is equipped with 802.11n Wi-Fi , Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS , according to the leak . In addition to the power-saving processor , a 3,910mAh battery should keep the tablet ticking for up to 10 hours . As the specs suggest , the new Asus tablet is decidedly budget in nature . It 's tipped to cost 149 Euros , or about $ 204/£121/AU $ 218 . Via Hot Hardware

Rumours of a Surface Mini have hotted up in recent weeks , but Microsoft also has an Intel-based Surface tablet in the works , according to multiple reports . Rumours of the Intel model first appeared on Bloomberg , and later a chip industry source confirmed to CNET that there will `` definitely '' be a new Surface model powered by an Intel processor . The source suggested that a Haswell variant with beefier battery life and Windows 8.1 will be outed , rather than one with an Atom Bay Trail processor . This matches Microsoft 's approach to the higher-end Surface Pro models , which have used Intel Core i5 chips , such as the Haswell Core i5-4300U in the Surface Pro 2 . Any new Surface tablet is likely to be joined by the Surface Mini , which is expected to house a Qualcomm chip and run Windows RT 8.1 . The Intel-based tablet will apparently be a regular-sized Surface tablet ( around 10.6 inches ) , but if the Surface Mini takes off , we could see lots of newer models in the months to come . Microsoft is expected to unveil the new Surface range at an event on May 20 .

Intel is doubling down on Chrome OS with a bevy of new Core i3-powered Chromebooks from multiple major manufacturers . Alongside Dell and Acer , Intel announced it is introducing its first Core i3 processors designed for Chromebooks this summer . The silicon maker detailed that the beefed up Dell Chromebook 11 with the new chip would come later this year . Meanwhile , the new Acer C720 will be ready for the `` early back-to-school season '' with a $ 349.99 ( about £206.18 , AU $ 373.96 ) price tag . Both machines proved to be hearty enough for our everyday cloud computing during our reviews and the more powerful Core i3 parts should make things even smoother . The increased process power should smooth out any potential hitches when streaming HD video and let users leave even more web browser tabs open . Intel also promised the parts will help load rich web apps up to four times faster and boost performance when holding Google Hangouts with multiple parties At a San Francisco event , Intel announced a few new devices equipped with the Bay Trail-M SoC . These parts are geared toward long battery life that will allow Chrome OS laptops to run for up to 11 hours . What 's more , the new architecture will allow manufacturers to produce fan-less , passively cooled Chromebooks , making them lighter and thinner . The Bay Trail-M SoC also supports touch-enabled screens and the latest version of wireless connectivity , 802.11ac Wi-Fi . With these new capabilities , Intel hinted we could start seeing even more varied Chromebook designs and form factors , such as the back-flipping displays on the Lenovo N20 and N20p . Asus also announced its own additions , the 11.6-inch C200 and a 13.3-inch C300 . Both cloud-based notebooks are expected to start shipping this summer . Lastly , Google announced it has teamed up to make yet another ChromeBox mini computer similar to the Mac Mini . The miniature Chome OS box will arrive in the US later this June with a Haswell Celeron processor . LG 's Chromebase was also dated to arrive in the US from May 26 priced at $ 349 ( about £205 , AU $ 372 ) . Via The Verge

Intel 's new Haswell chips are here . The question is , should you care ? As we 'll discover , the answer depends entirely on what you want from a PC . Haswell is a new family of 22nm processors from Intel , still known as i3 , i5 and i7 inside PCs and on the shelf . So has Intel succeeded again ? As we 'll find out the answer is a bit of yes and no . Where Intel has failed us , those failures are entirely intentional . Where it has succeeded , it reflects Intel 's current and likely future priorities . To put it simply , Intel 's consumer-level processors have been all about mobility right back to those first Core processors in 2006 . Intel will release a new version of Haswell , called Haswell-E , in the second half of 2014 , possibly at IDF in San Francisco to target the lucrative enthusiast/workstation markets . This new version , whose launch Intel apparently postponed by a couple of quarters , will see the introduction of a new chipset ( the X99 ) , Intel 's first 8-core , non-server processor as well as DDR4 memory . But with Haswell , that focus has almost entirely put paid to progress to the pure CPU part of the chip in desktop performance terms . We 'll find out more about this bias as we dig deeper into the technicalities of the new Haswell chips . But what was a niggling doubt with previous processors has become screamingly obvious . Intel has done almost nothing to improve the desktop experience with Haswell . For mobile PCs , Haswell is all kinds of awesome . You could even argue it 's the beginning of a new era of computing . Laptops that can survive for a week on a single charge . Touch devices that combine a true tablet form factor with the power of a desktop PC . It 's portable , nay pocketable , computing with any compromises . The work Intel has done with both power consumption and integrated graphics is excellent for laptops and tablets . It 's also very promising for a new generation of ultra-compact PCs , including Intel 's own NUC as well as set-top boxes , tiny gaming machines , PCs hanging off the back of monitors , you name it , Haswell is going to make it either possible or much better than before . If that 's the upside , the downside is that with Haswell , Intel has taken its disregard for desktop customers to new levels of indifference , maybe even spite . Yes , the desktop is somewhat on the wane by some metrics . And the fact that Intel 's main competitor , AMD , has failed to turn up to the fight in several parts of the traditional desktop market hardly helps . But even taking those factors into account , the way Intel has designed , positioned and priced desktop Haswell processors approaches spite for desktop customers . Somebody 's got to say it . So we will . But hold that thought . First , let 's deep dive into Haswell as a technology . Because as you 'd expect from an Intel processor architecture , it 's a marvel of modern chip engineering . That 's actually something all too easy to loose sight of , especially when Intel muddies the message with its marketing machinations . Haswell is a proper bit of kit . The big news involves two key metrics , power efficiency and graphics . Intel says Haswell represents the biggest single generational gain in power efficiency in the history of its x86 PC processors . Yup , bigger even than the gains Intel made going from the infamously overheating end-of-line Netburst Pentium 4 chips to the first Core Duo processors . Wow . So what has Intel done to achieve that and what does it mean for actual devices like laptops and tablets ? The process started with Intel changing its targets for power consumption . 35 to 45 watts used to be the design target for Intel mobile processors . Now the target is 10 to 20 watts . And do n't forget , we 're talking about relatively mainstream chips here , not the very lowest voltage parts .
Nearly a year after it was first mooted , rumors from Singapore are now suggesting that Intel will launch the enthusiast/workstation version of its latest micro-architecture , called Haswell-E , in September . According to VR-zone , both Intel 's Haswell-E processors and the corresponding Intel X99 chipset will go on sale on 14th of September , which would coincide with Intel 's IDF which will run in San Francisco from 9th of September . Three Core-i7 processors are expected to debut with a flagship model , the 5960x , sporting eight cores , 20MB L3 cache , clocked at up to 3GHz ( turbo boost to 3.3GHz ) with a TDP of 140W . Note that the new Haswell-E range will not be pin compatible with the current Haswell range ( on LGA-1150 ) ; instead a new socket , LGA 2011-3 , will be introduced . In addition , it will require DDR4 memory which is incompatible with existing motherboards . These parts are geared towards the enterprise/prosumer markets and will likely carry hefty price tags .

HP has recruited Stuart Pann , Intel 's current VP/GM ( Business Management Group ) , to head its massive PPS ( Printing and Personal systems ) group . According to an email sent to Business Insider , one of the reasons he was brought onboard is because of his expertise in pricing strategy , one that apparently helped him contribute to significant revenue growth at Intel . Tightening in the supply chain combined with right pricing would decrease outgoings and increase intakes , which in turn would significantly improve margins . The company 's current operating margins have been stagnant for the last two years , at around 6.6 % . HP 's PPS accounts for the majority of the company 's revenue , bringing in nearly $ 28 billion ( around £16.5 billion , AU $ 30 billion ) for the first six months of 2014 , three times the size of its enterprise unit . HP is expected to make up to 50,000 employees redundant by the end of 2014 , nearly twice what was announced in 2012 .

Intel is a changing semiconductor manufacturer . It announced that it would ship a Xeon processor with a FPGA ( Field-programmable gate array ) component . The latter is connected to the actual processor via Intel 's QPI ( quick path interface ) and can be reconfigured to suit the specific needs of its customers . In other words , the variable part of the can be redesigned to suit new workloads or changing compute demands . In a post on Intel 's data center blog , Diane Bryant , Intel 's GM for its Data Centre group , confirmed that the company delivered 15 custom products in 2013 to hyperscale clients including Ebay and Facebook . Bryant says that Intel will more than double that amount with the Xeon FPGA-powered processor being part of an equation which also includes Xeon Phi and Atom-based Xeon parts . Low latency and coherent interface should help the new FPGA-infused CPU deliver up to 20x perfornance gains compared to a traditional x86 setup . Not much is known about the end product though ; it will be pin compatible with the existing Xeon E5 LGA 2011 socket and will target data centres and enterprise ecosystems . The FPGA bit is likely to be sourced from a close Intel partner like Altera who already use Intel 's manufacturing plants . Do n't expect it to come to the company 's desktop or mobile range or even the company 's entry level server processors .

Intel has announced its latest high-end processors to the world . Codenamed Devil 's Canyon ( Intel 's codenames are getting better ) , we first heard of this chip series back in March , but we 're only now allowed to talk about the details . And the key detail is that this is Intel 's first 22nm chip to be clocked at 4GHz across all four cores – more on that shortly . Essentially though , this is n't a new generation of technology – it 's the refresh of the Haswell fourth-generation Core processors which we saw launched a year ago – most of the parts will have minor performance bumps over their Haswell equivalents – they still use the same 22nm 3D Tri-gate transistor design . This 'Haswell refresh ' fills the gap before we see the fifth-generation 14nm Broadwell processors in 2015 . We 'd put our money on an announcement taking place at CES 2015 , alongside numerous design wins . Intel 's own roadmaps show the architecture slated for the first half of 2015 . Let 's be clear - the Haswell refresh is n't a die-shrink of the existing 22nm Haswell microarchitecture . That will have to wait for Broadwell . So in Intel 's tick-tock processor cadence the new releases have gone from Sandy Bridge ( tock ) , Ivy Bridge ( tick ) , Haswell ( tock ) and Broadwell ( tick ) . The next completely new architecture is the tremendously-named Skylake , which will debut in late 2015 or very early 2016 . Rival AMD launched the 28nm Kaveri at the start of the year based on its Steamroller architecture , which followed Richland this time last year , but it has not yet announced details of the follow-up . The Devil 's Canyon parts are unashamedly enthusiast-level desktop processors . Think Intel is foolish for pursuing the desktop PC market ? Think again . Amongst all the relentless hype that the PC market is in decline , the key fact is that millions of desktop PCs are still being sold and that the enthusiast/gaming market is actually growing – JPR predicts 6.5 per cent growth during 2014 , with continued growth through 2016 . JPR Is also predicting that the market for PC gaming hardware will rise from around $ 20 billion in 2013 to around $ 25 billion in 2016 . Similarly the same rise in gaming software revenue is predicted between a smaller timeframe - 2013 - 2015 . Lisa Graff , head of desktop platforms at Intel said in a conference call to us that `` in Q4 2013 as we were looking at our desktop strategy [ we saw ] the growth in PC gaming was far more than across the PC market in general – there 's some pretty strong growth . '' Devil 's Canyon will debut in the guise of an overclockers ' dream – a fully unlocked 4Ghz 4 core , 8 thread Core i7-4790K that slots in above a Core i5-4690K . Make no mistake , the Core i7 version is an incredible CPU that 's fully socket compatible with the current 1150 pin LGA package ( Devil 's Canyon is compatible with both Series 8 and Series 9 chipsets ) and features the latest on-board Intel HD 4600 graphics . The maximum boost clock is a whopping 4.4GHz and there 's a cited 88W TDP ( Thermal Design Power ) to match . The four core , four thread i5 is clocked at 3.5Ghz out-of-the-box with a maximum boost clock of 3.9Ghz . TDP is again cited at 88W . Again there is Intel HD 4600 graphics on board . The new parts include an improved thermal interface material ( TIM ) designed to enable improved overclocking over previous processor generations through better dissipation of heat , a problem with recent generations of high-end Core processors . Intel calls the material used a Next-Generation Polymer Thermal Interface Material ( NGPTIM ) and adds that the new ships have new capacitors to 'smooth ' power delivery to the die during high performance . `` We developed this on a very tight timeline '' , adds Graff . `` We looked at it in Q4 2013 and gave ourselves a target to get to 4Ghz and with a nice overclock bump in 2014 not 2015 . And , since we were coming out with our Series 9 chipset , let 's time it with that .

Intel announced that it will be collaborating with Samsung Display division in order to bring down the selling price of 4K monitors to $ 399 ( about £240 or AUS $ 430 ) . The entry price of 4K monitors has been decreasing steadily and now lies at around £499 in the UK . Speaking at Computex , Kirt Skaugen , Intel 's PC Client group GM , hinted that the company wants to push 4K in order to revive the desktop , TheInquirer reports . Intel will work with monitor vendors TPV ( AOC , Spectre , Philips ) and Viewsonic to deliver 4K monitors at that price point . The monitors , Intel says , will have a refresh rate of 60Hz , Technicolor certification , a 1 -- % sRGB color gamut coverage and a 23.6-inch diagonal . They will have the highest pixel density of any commercial monitors in the market at 190ppi , second only to the legendary IBM T220 . It will also team up with a bunch of Taiwanese and Chinese OEMs to deliver 4K all in ones for under $ 1000 ( £600 or AUS $ 1080 ) .
From the Oculus Rift to 4K and Steam Machines , the PC has hardly fallen short in the innovation department in recent times . But until now , few box makers have innovated when it comes to taming the unruly mass of computer wiring that snakes down the back of every office and bedroom desk in the land . Intel is looking to change all that by making the PC completely wire-free by 2016 , PCAdvisor reports . Announcing the company 's plans at Computex , Intel 's SVP of Computing Kirk Skaugen said it would do so using an upcoming CPU reference design codenamed Skylake - which will succeed Broadwell - that uses the company 's WiGig tech ( rather than cables ) to carry and display data signals . WiGig has a much shorter range than Wi-Fi ( around 10 metres ) , but it can deliver speeds of up to 7Gbps , compared to the 1.3Gbps of 802.11ac . This makes it speedy enough to beam content to replace HDMI and DisplayPort for high-resolution displays , and it could also be used to connect mice , keyboards and other peripherals . As a secondary purpose , Skaugen said that the company is looking at adding wireless charging to its next-gen wireless modules . Much like wireless charging mats that can juice up smartphones , laptops would be able to charge when placed on hard surfaces . The tech already exists in docking stations , and the next step is integrating it into computers themselves , according to Intel .

Intel will launch a line of solid-state drives ( SSDs ) designed to improve performance over traditional hard disk drives ( HDDs ) , the company said June 3 . The Intel Solid-State Drive Data Center Family for PCIe includes the Intel SSD DC P3700 Series for write-intensive applications , the Intel SSD DC P3600 Series for mixed workloads and the Intel SSD DC P3500 Series for read-heavy uses . The new line of Intel SSDs uses PCIe 3.0 specification and a PCIe interface controller architected with NVMe . The PCIe with NVMe is built to moves data and storage closer to the processor , in order to eliminate latency . The line is expected to deliver up to 2.8GB per second read speeds , up to 1.9GB per second write speeds , and up to 460,000 input and outputs per second . The NVMe 1.0 Industry Standard , which the new SSDs will utilize , feature a new storage interface protocol developed by the NVMHCI Work Group that is meant to boost performance and reduce latency . The reduced interface latency is designed to exceed 6 Gbps SATA SSDs . The line of SSDs works on Windows and Linux . The drives are backed by Intel ’ s 5-year limited warranty and have an average time between failures of 2 million hours . The P3700 Series offers 10 full-drive writes per day over the life of the drive , which totals 36 petabytes , or 459 years of high-definition video . The P3600 Series delivers three drive writes per day , and the P3500 Series offers 0.3 drive writes per day . The Intel SSD Data Center Family for PCIe will be offered at a starting price of $ 560 . On June 3 , Intel also introduced its new processor family , the K-series , an Intel Pentium processor Anniversary Edition to celebrate the 20 years of the brand , and a slim 2-in-1 tablet and laptop that feature ’ s Intel ’ s new Core M processor .
Intel just unveiled a stunningly slim 2-in-1 tablet and laptop to showcase its latest Core M processor . Announced at Computex 2014 , the 12.5-inch tablet prototype is a new reference PC design that measures a mere 7.2-milimeters thin . It 's profile is impressive , but equally eye ( or ear ) catching is that it does n't need a whirring fan to stay cool . With the extra weight of the fan taken off , the tablet weighs a stark 670-grams . The device also comes with a clip-in keyboard and it could be the first in a long line of extremely thin tablets and laptops . The silicon maker described its new 14nm chipset as the most energy efficient Core processor in the company 's history . According to Engadget , the new system-on-a-chip boasts a 20 % to 40 % performance improvement while lowering power needs by up to 45 % and producing 60 % less heat . Intel promises customers will see the first Core M processor powered devices on sale starting next year . We 've already seen some slender devices such as the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 , but in our review the obtrusive fan still holds the device back by making it unnecessarily noisy . With Intel 's Core M processor we could finally see more tablets become as light as the iPad Air while still having all the power to run a full version of Windows 8.1 . Beyond tablets , laptops such as the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air could become even slimmer as they also move to a fan-less , passively cooled design .
Intel seems to have a clear target audience with the launch of its new Devil 's Canyon processor range at Computex in Taipei . A new devilish logo combined with an emphasis on overclocking thanks to a new thermal interface module means that the products are likely to be a big hit with gamers . The new processor family – known as the K-series - is essentially a `` tick '' in the company 's calendar and an evolution of Haswell 's microarchitecture . It currently has two members with the flagship model – the Core i7-4790K - clocked at a whopping 4GHz and manufactured on a 22nm node . They are also unlocked , can be overclocked by 10 % and come with a HD 4600 graphics subsystem clocked at 1.25GHz . Intel also announced an Intel Pentium processor Anniversary Edition to celebrate the 20 years of the brand . This particular SKU ( stock keeping unit ) is unlocked , has 2 cores and a base frequency of 3.2GHz . The processors will be available globally towards the end of the month . The fastest Intel processor was the Intel Xeon `` Westmere '' X5698 which was clocked at 4.4GHz and launched in 2011 .

Servers powered by IBM 's Power8 architecture are expected to reach the market early 2015 as Big Blue announced that it will license its technology to others . Ken King , general manager , OpenPower alliances at IBM 's Systems and Technology Group , confirmed that the servers would initially target cloud and high-end applications . The move comes as IBM 's Power-based server sales plunged 28 % in the second quarter after the company decided to sell its x86 server range to Lenovo earlier this year . It will also allow IBM to gather more momentum by increasing industry support , the application base and the size of the ecosystem - in a similar manner to what Oracle did with Open Sparc . IBM formed the OpenPower Alliance last year ahead of that announcement and counts Google , Ubuntu , Samsung , Nvidia and Micron as its key members . Google was apparently interested in the number of virtual machines supported by Power8 compared to x86 architecture . IBM only introduced its first Power8 products last month ; the chip runs at up to 5GHz with up to 12 cores , 96MB L3 cache and 96 threads . It 's also worth noting the presence of a surprisingly high number of Chinese companies , nearly 10 of them , which might be an indication that the Power architecture has received a tacit approval from the Chinese government .

Intel has launched a new SSD product , the SSD Pro 2500 series which is aimed at a business audience with its main feature being hardware-based 256-bit AES encryption As a self-encrypted drive , it can , in theory mitigate ( but not eliminate ) data breaches and doing so without a drop in hardware performance . The drives , which are available in 2.5in and the smaller M.2 form factor , have capacities ranging from 120GB to 480GB and support the OPAL 2.0 standard from the Trusted Computing Group and Microsoft 's eDrive . They also have a five year warranty and an annualized failure rate below 1 % , far lower than the competition , Intel stated . Interestingly , the drives can be remotely managed via Intel 's vPro while its performance can be monitored via the Intel SSD Pro administrator tool . The drive is quoted as having sustained sequential read speeds of 540MB/s and writes of 490MB/s , while random 4K reads top up to 48,000 IOPS and 4K writes hit 80,000 IOPS . Pro 2500 Series users will also be able to choose between five power modes that scale from better battery life to better performance . Sandisk launched an SED SSD range , the X300 , back in May with storage capacities of up to 1TB .

Intel has added 11 new SKUs to its mobile processor portfolio for all budgets , with three Celeron , one Pentium , three Core i5 and four Core i7 models . The first two familes are BayTrail based while the others are Haswell-based ; they are all manufactured using a 22nm manufacturing process . There 's a quad-core Celeron model , the N2940 , with a 7.5W TDP , 2MB of L2 cache and a base clock speed of 1.83GHz which is likely to be a favourite amongst laptop makers . On an even lower TDP is the Celeron N2808 which has a 4.3W TDP , two cores , 1MB L2 cache and can clock at up to 2.25GHz ; it is a slight improvement on the N2807 , a sign perhaps that Intel has tweaked its manufacturing process even further . Although Intel has n't killed the Atom brand completely , the fact that it does n't list them in its pricelist pretty much means that it is gone , at least for client-side products . Atom still exist for smartphones , server/storage and communications products but on desktop and laptops we reckon that it is all but a foregone brand .

Intel has announced that Oracle 's Exadata Database Machine X4-8 , a data crunching powerhouse , will come be powered by a 15-core Xeon processor . That means that the CPU can be optimised on the fly depending on the workload and resource requirements . Based on Ivy Bridge architecture and clocked at up to 3.4GHz , the Xeon E7-8890 v2 will support up to 12TB RAM across an 8-socket node and share 37.5MB of cache . This chip is not the one that was announced last month and promised performance gains of up to 20x compared to a traditional processor thanks to a FPGA . Oracle describes the X4-8 as suited for `` high-end OLTP [ online transaction processing ] workloads , in-memory or memory-intensive workloads , large-scale database consolidations , including DBaaS , and multi-rack data warehouses . '' It supports up to 240 CPU cores and up to 12TB of memory for database processing with 168 CPU cores dedicated to SQL processing . Intel is facing growing competition from its nimbler rivals , AMD and ARM , to procure customised silicon for some of its bigger clients . The company revealed that 15 custom products have been shipped in 2013 with more than double that amount expected in 2014 .

Intel has started shipping new models of its Xeon E5 processors with products likely to come over the next few months , its CEO Brian Krzanich announced during an earnings call . These will sport Haswell rather than the current Ivy Bridge technology , which is likely to bump performance significantly . The new processors , codenamed Grantley , will replace the Romley family . Server processors usually get updated several quarters after their consumer siblings . The Xeon E5 has been Intel 's best selling server product , targetting the mid-range two to four-socket market , with the E3 and the E7 focusing on single socket and four sockets or more respectively . All the big server manufacturers - Dell , Lenovo , HP - are expected to sell products based around the new E5 . Perhaps the biggest differentiator is that it is only takes DDR4 memory , which means that a straight processor replacement is impossible . Intel will face growing competition from AMD and a handful of other ARM-based manufacturers who seek to clinch a small portion of the server market both at the lower and high end . But Intel wo n't stand still . It has already started to offer customization services to select customers and has unveiled plans to sell a Xeon chip with an FPGA component . Via Computerworld

Acer aimed to balance specs and price when its C720 Chromebook landed back in December , and now the company has announced two beefed-up models for those seeking a step up in the power department . Both are available with Intel Core-i3 processors , which should provide a healthy performance boost over the original version 's Celeron-flavoured chip . The lower-priced C720-3871 , which sports 2GB RAM , enters the fray at $ 350 ( around £204/AU $ 372 ) - around $ 150 more than the original C720 , which still stands as one of the most affordable Chromebooks on the market . The more powerful C720-3404 , which packs an Intel Core i3-40005U processor ( 1.7GHz , 3MB L3 Cache ) and 4GB of memory , will set you back $ 380 ( around £222 / AU $ 404 ) . That processor brings the C720 closer to the power of the Chromebook Pixel , which remains the most powerful Chromebook on the market thanks to an Intel Core-i5 processor , and a wallet-thumping price tag to match ( £1259 - around $ 2,184 or AU $ 2,327 ) . Both of the new variants come with an 11.6-inch HD display toting a 1366x768 resolution and tote HD4400 integrated graphics . Connectivity options include 802.11 a/g/b/n Wi-Fi , HDMI and USB ( 2.0 and 3.0 ) ports , and they also get 32GB SSDs that allow the devices to wake up in an instant . Of the two , only the C720-3871 is currently listed on Amazon 's US website . No word yet on global availability and pricing .

Chromebooks are n't typically noted for their impressive specs , but Acer has taken a step in the right direction with the announcement of the first Chromebook with Intel 's Core i3 chip at its heart . It 's not a brand new Acer Chromebook , but rather an upgraded version of the Acer C720 that was released in 2013 . According to a press release , the superior Intel chip provides the new C720 variant with improved performance and multi-tasking , while battery life remains the same at an expected 8.5 hours . The same announcement calls the laptop `` a new class of Chromebook . '' The upgraded Acer C720 itself comes in two variants : the C720-3404 , with 4GB of memory , and the C720-3871 , with just 2GB . Both launch in North America in July with a 32GB solid state drive for storage . The former costs $ 379.99 ( about £222 , AU $ 404 ) while the version with less memory is $ 349.99 ( about £204 , AU $ 372 ) . For those doing the math that 's just a few bucks cheaper for half the memory - an easy choice . In TechRadar 's review of the original Acer C720 Chromebook we said the budget laptop could make for a great backup , but might prove frustrating as your main PC thanks to its mediocre screen , keyboard and speakers , not to mention the limitations inherent to Chrome OS . Considering this new Intel Core i3-equipped model is at least $ 150 more expensive , it 's worth taking all its strengths and flaws into account .

Broadwell is the next generation of Intel Core CPUs . It will power most of the laptops and desktops we 'll see over the next 18 months , among other kinds of gadget . It 's not here yet , but many , many people are eager for its arrival . Including us . Broadwell is Intel 's fifth generation of Core-series processor , and will define the sort of power we 'll be able to get from our computers of the future . It 's pretty important , but what 's new ? We 're going to have a peek into Broadwell to see whether it 's worth holding off for , as the first Broadwell computers will start flying of shelves towards the end of the year . Intel upgrades its core processor range every year to 18 months with a new generation of chips . However , it 's not a whole new system every time . It follows a 'tick tock ' path of upgrades , something the company has used since 2007 . But what on Earth does 'tick tock ' mean ? If one year 's upgrade offers a completely new processor architecture , the next will be a shrinking of that processor 's layout . Shrinking a processor 's architecture makes it more efficient , if perhaps not always radically more powerful . Intel Haswell was a 'tock ' upgrade – a new architecture . Intel Broadwell is a 'tick ' , and sees Haswell shrink down , make it that bit more streamline . So , how much smaller will Broadwell be ? The architecture shrinking process is n't about getting the actual chips smaller , but the transistors that make up the CPU 's brain . Intel Haswell uses 22 nanometer transistors , Broadwell 's transistors will be 14nm . Back in 2006 , the first Core processors had whopping great big 65nm ones . We 've made a lot of progress in those eight years . If you 're wondering how big a nanometer is , a normal human hair is about 90,000 nanometers thick . These transistors are incredibly tiny , even the old ones . They are the switches that work together to perform the incredibly complex functions a processor has to deal with , and there are more than a billion of them in a modern CPU . The big claim about Broadwell is that its chips will be 30 % more efficient than Haswell 's ones , using 30 % less power while providing slightly better performance at the same clock speed . Everyone 's a winner . Haswell already made huge improvements to efficiency compared with the previous generation , Ivy Bridge , resulting in a huge upsurge in the battery life of Windows laptops last year . Looking at what Haswell did when it arrived in 2013 tells us what we can expect in Broadwell . For an example , the 2012 13-inch MacBook Air was rated by Apple for seven hours of battery life when web browsing . It used the Ivy Bridge generation of Intel chip , one step behind the current Haswell models . Today 's Haswell 13-inch MacBook Airs last up to 12 hours . That 's an extra five hours of stamina , and a lot of that was down to Haswell . With the upgrades of Broadwell in tow , we could be looking at laptops that last for more than 15 hours . Finally , we 'll have laptops that can outlast current tablets . Pure battery life is not the most important part of why Broadwell really matters , though . Having better efficiency will enable a laptop screen revolution . In the last few years , laptops have lagged way behind phones and tablets in terms of screen technology . If you have a good phone and a mid-range laptop , there 's a good chance your phone 's screen will have more pixels than your laptop 's . It 's a bit mad when you stop and think about it . Greater efficiency will allow laptops without giant batteries to use higher-res screens without a deal-breaking battery life hit . We wo n't see ultra-high res £300 laptops just yet , but this is the first step to affordable laptops whose screens are n't as blocky as Minecraft .

Some of the most influential technology companies have teamed up to launch the Open Interconnect Consortium ( OIC ) , which will work on a common communication framework for the Internet of Things . The founding members of that entity include Intel and its subsidiary Wind River , Atmel , Broadcom , Dell and Samsung . The OIC has been launched only a few months after a similar venture called AllSeen Alliance was unveiled by the not-for-profit Linux Foundation . AllSeen is based on Qualcomm 's rival AllJoyn prompting fears of a chasm comparable to those that hit wireless charging , optical disks ( Blu-Ray vs HD-DVD ) and tape ( Betacam vs VHS ) where manufacturers and developers have to decide where to invest their resoruces . Surprisingly enough , Jim Zemlin , executive director of The Linux Foundation , welcomed the announcement saying , `` Open source is about collaboration and about choice . The Open Interconnect Consortium is yet another proof point how open source helps to fuel innovation '' . AllSeen however currently has the upperhand with regards to the number of recruited members with more than 50 members , including Microsoft , LG , Sharp and Panasonic , having added their names .
Intel has announced that it will be manufacturing system-on-chip ( SoC ) products for Japanese electronics giant Panasonic , becoming the company 's sixth customer . Other names include Altera , Achronix Semiconductor , Tabula , Netromome and Microsemi . None of them are household names but it 's likely that Intel deliberately wants to keep any direct competitors to its product lines at bay . Panasonic will use Intel 's 14nm Tri-gate manufacturing process to churn out its own SoCs for its consumer electronics products . These are likely to be ARM-based and the partnership will help Intel keep its manufacturing facilities running at capacity as demand for traditional products such as x86 processors soften . Intel is one of the few chipmakers that design and owns its own manufacturing plants . Long-standing rival AMD got rid of its expensive manufacturing capabilities back in 2009 , spinning it out as GlobalFoundries . Intel launched its foundry business back in 2010 and offers some of the most advanced manufacturing manufacturing capabilities in the world of semiconductors with rivals still having to mass produce 14nm products .

Two separate leaks have shed more light on Intel 's Broadwell and Skylake product range . Other than the fact they are expected to be launched in the second half of 2015 ( just in time for Computex 2015 ) , they will also be introduced at the lower end of the market ( mainstream and premium in Intel lingo ) rather than at the `` Extreme '' end . Both Broadwell - Haswell 's tick - and Skylake - a new micro architecture or Intel 's tock - will be built using a 14nm process . The former is likely to be unlocked , slot into socket-1150 motherboards with a 9-series chipset while Skylake , at least in its desktop version - is said to be locked with a socket-1151 motherboard based on a 100-series chipset . A second leak claims that Intel will have four versions of Skylake with some of them sporting eDRAM ( up to 128MB ) , support for DDR4 ( but not DDR4L ) and TDP ranging from 4W to a massive 95W . Skylake will initially be available in two and four-core configurations and will not sport an IVR ( Internal Voltage Regulator ) as it was the case on previous generations . Via VR-Zone and WCCFTech

If you follow Intel 's tick-tock processor chronology , you 'll know that we 're due a 'tick ' – a die shrink of the current process architecture . Called Broadwell , we 'll see most of those parts in very early 2015 ( expect a big consumer launch at CES 2015 in January ) but Intel 's slated timeframe is rather sooner than that . But by any reckoning 2013 's 22nm Haswell is yesterday 's news right ? Wrong . Intel still has one power play to make with the 22nm microarchitecture first seen in late 2011 's Ivy Bridge . And that 's in the form of Haswell-E – the latest generation of the company 's flagship Extreme processor line . Available in six and eight-core variants ( with 12 and 16 threads respectively ) these are powerhouse processors that are clocked at speeds up to 3.5Ghz and boast nicely unlocked multipliers . Again they use Intel 's TriGate 3D transistor tech . The clockspeeds of these CPUs are somewhat lower than the recent 4GHz Devil 's Canyon version of Haswell ( referred to as the Haswell Refresh ) launched earlier this year , but they have more cores and are significantly more expensive as a result ( the 4Ghz Core i7-4790K had a box price of $ 350 ) . These new chips are designed to continue Intel 's total dominance of the enthusiast computing market . Also debuting alongside them is the X99 platform featuring the new DDR4 memory standard . One thing Intel 's Extreme processors do less of compared to their lower class brethren is provide extra graphical power . A lot less . In fact , they have none . That 's unusual at a time when increasing amounts of CPU die real estate is being given over to graphical grunt . But no onboard graphics means there 's more space for what enthusiast and high end users really want – more processing grunt to use alongside a discrete card ( or cards ) . And more cores is exactly what you get . These are the most powerful desktop chips around . Finally we also get an eight core version too ; despite various improvements in production processes , six core server parts ( being several years old now ) and rival AMD already having an eight core part , Intel has previously resisted . Until now . The Core i7 5960X , which does n't stop impressing with the core count , offers 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes plus a whopping 20MB of cache , too . If you 're balking at the price then do n't – to upgrade the Mac Pro 's 3.5Ghz six core Xeon E5 to an eight core version requires a build-to-order option….and an extra cost of $ 1,500 . Planning a system with two graphics cards in SLI or CrossFire mode ? You probably want the middle or high end version of these for the extra PCI-Express support . Enthusiasts tend not to care , but it 's worth pointing out that one of the main issues with these CPUs is power consumption - 140W TDP is significantly more than even the 88 W TDP of the high end Devil 's Canyon CPU even without any graphics capability . But Haswell-E does run significantly cooler than Ivy Bridge-E however , and that can only be a good thing in terms of performance . So what levels of performance do you get ? At a recent Intel demo day , we were shown Haswell-E in action . It ripped through a Cinebench R15 test . If you 've used Cinebench , you 'll be used to the graphic appearing very gradually . Not so with the Core i7 5960X – it rendered 16 sections chunk by chunk . Our colleagues at PC Format benchmarked the CPU and initially noted that , `` it looks a little off the pace when you compare it with the 3.6GHz/4GHz configuration of the last Ivy Bridge E processor . '' And that 's before you mention the 4GHz clock of the aforementioned Devil 's Canyon . The lower clock is to ensure that sustainable yields of this eight core monster can be produced ( do you really think Intel would have resisted clocking it at 4Ghz as well if it was sustainable to do so ? ) without one or more of the cores throwing a wobbly during the manufacturing process . But remember one simple thing – Extreme Editions are meant to be overclocked . These CPUs are pretty strong at stock , but they 're designed to be strong when you push the boundaries and up the clockspeed . You can see the difference in Cinebench scores here : PC Format found the 5960X achieved 1387 in Cinebench R15 at stock and a huge score of 1719 at peak overclocked performance . Together with the X99 chipset , PC Format saw a 25 % boost in multi-threaded applications compared to the previous Ivy Bridge E champion-chip , the Core i7 4960X and a general performance uplift of over 50 % . That 's nothing short of stunning . Intel is also making a big play of the new chips supporting Thunderbolt 2 , but until we see PC manufacturers jumping on the Intel/Apple bandwagon , it 's somewhat irrelevant . There are a growing number of performance applications that can take advantage of four or more processor threads including Adobe Photoshop . Lightroom , Premiere Pro and After Effects , Cyberlink Power Director and Power Producer , HandBrake , Nero Multimedia Suite , Roxio Creator , Sony Vegas , Abbyy Fine Reader , Blender , Corel Digital/Video Studio , Magix and Steinberg Cubase . Once again , Intel has come up with the goods with the 5960X . It 's an incredible CPU capable of performing sixteen threads of wonderment . As ever , make sure you actually need this level of performance before you shell out for it – and if you 're not going to overclock it then you do n't need it . But if you decide to pay through the nose , you 'll have one incredible PC . Read the forthcoming issue of PC Format magazine for full gaming and performance benchmarks for all the Haswell-E processors .
Before the fourth generation of Intel processors fade into the sunset , it 's going to have one last hurrah : the new Intel Core i7-5960X , 5930K and 5820K Haswell-E CPUs . Unveiled today during Intel 's keynote at PAX Prime , the Santa Clara-based company 's latest line of processors take heavy-weight gaming to the next level by adding an additional two or four cores to the already beefy line of quad-core Haswell i7 CPUs . According to Intel , machines packing the 5960X will allow up to 20 percent faster 4K video editing and boost in-game physics calculations by a respectable 14 percent over the current reigning champ , the i7-4960X , using Adobe Premier Pro CC and 3DMark Fire Strike to test video editing and gaming , respectively . Also on the docket for an upgrade is the system 's memory processing capability . Expect the line of Haswell-E processors to work seamlessly with the DDR4 2133MHz RAM slowly trickling out of memory vendors Corsair , Kingston and Crucial . Admittedly , eight cores may be overkill . With only a handful of applications properly threaded to handle that much processing power it 's improbable you 'd see a cost-effective increase in the day-to-day use of your PC - though , that 's up for debate until we test out a unit for ourselves . However , the 5960X theoretically supports four SLI-enabled GPUs and that latest round of RAM , giving gamers good reason to pay attention to the power-hungry Haswell-E chip . Plus , considering the CPU can be overclocked to a hasty 3.5GHz , it 's sure to turn some heads . That premium speed boost comes at a price . Stateside , the Intel Core i7 5960X will retail for just under a grand ( $ 999 , about £600 , AU $ 1,070 ) while the 5930K and 5820K will get $ 583 ( about £350 , AU $ 624 ) and $ 389 ( about £235 , AU $ 416 ) price tags , respectively . Thinking about upgrading your rig ? Haswell-E chips only slot into into LGA 2011-v3 sockets , which , at this point , have n't hit the market . Manufacturers are sure to start rolling them out soon , though , so expect octo-core processors take over the mainstream this time next year .

Intel has released a new dua ; -band HSPA modem called the XMM6255 , one which is aimed at IoT , 3G smartphones , M2M as well as what it calls unconventional client devices , The modem combines the X-Gold 625 baseband processor , an integrated power management unit as well as Intel 's Smarti UE2p , a transceiver with a 3G power amplifier . The total board area occupied by the components is about 300 mm^2 , that 's even smaller than the US one-cent ( or one penny ) coin at 362.90 mm^2 and Intel claims that it is the smallest standalone 3G modem . The XMM6255 is rated at 7.2mbps and while it is slower than the 3G+ or 4G connectivity , it is faster tha Bluetooth Low Energy ( BLE ) or other short range , low power technologies it competes with . Extreme integration means that Intel 's partners will be able to lower their bill of material costs while improving reliability ( better heat dissipation , improved ruggedness etc ) . Intel has n't disclosed the power consumption of the XMM6255 or how much it will cost . Since the acquisition of Infineon 's Wireless Solution Business four years ago , it unveiled a number of baseband solutions but none of them has made it into `` halo '' flagship devices or large volume products . That remains , until now , the quasi-exclusive domain of another US semiconductor giant , Qualcomm , with its integrated SoC and its Atheros baseband range .

The entire roadmap of Intel 's Next Unit of Computing ( NUC ) range has been leaked and shows some interesting readjustments that will position NUCs as decent replacements for traditional full-size computers . According to slides leaked by Fanlesstech , the next NUC to ship will be a Maple Canyon model powered by a Core i5 , specifically the 4300U . Other than V Pro and TPM , it 's worth noting that it will offer both M.2 and a SATA 3 port with optional 2.5-inch drive . Intel has also opted to add NFC and an unidentified ( and possibly undocumented new ) feature called `` WCHG HDRs '' . Next year will also see the addition of four Broadwell-based NUCs in Q1 2015 and a Braswell-based one in the second quarter of 2015 . The latter , which carries the codename Pinnacle Canyon , can accommodate only one SO-DIMM and will come with a VGA and an HDMI port . As for the Broadwell models , they will aim for mainstream gaming , content creation and immersive gaming - potentially targeting the same audience as Steam PCs - with the ability to drive 4K displays . We note with interest that the entry price of NUCs which are essentially NetPCs has been steadily dropping . You can now get a number of models for well under £100 , which makes us wonder whether Intel partners are not finding the giant 's latest initiative somewhat disruptive to their business .

Intel paid a whopping $ 650 million ( about £400 million , AU $ 700 million ) to get its hands on LSI 's Axxia Networking Business , a transaction that was done in cash . Shares of the Santa-Clara based company have risen by more than three per cent since then , bringing the stock close to its 52-week high - its highest point for more than a decade . LSI was purchased last year by Avago Technologies for $ 6.6 billion ( about £4 billion , AU $ 7 billion ) and the company made no secret that it wanted to sell LSI 's networking business which employs more than 650 people . The deal , which is still due to go through due diligence from public bodies , is expected to bring north of $ 110 million ( £65 million , AU $ 120 million ) of annual revenues every year . Axxia 's IP is likely to allow Intel to propose more rounded offerings from mobile to data centres - and everything in between with wireless access underpinning the lot . Axxia makes enterprise communication processors , custom silicon and mobile communication processors , all of which use non-Intel architectures , Power and ARM.. Via Venturebeat

Intel has quietly started to disable TSX instructions in Haswell and early Broadwell processors , something the company candidly revealed to a group of US-based technology journalists during a meeting last week . The set of Transactional Synchronisation Extensions allows developers to decide how the CPU resources are allocated to multi-threaded applications , and it seems that the errata was unearthed by a third party and subsequently confirmed by Intel . But rather than recall the parts , Intel decide to disable the TSX instructions via a microcode delivered straight to the manufacturer 's motherboard . TechReport suggests that software developers that work with TSX instructions will be left with two choices : either not updating their systems and risk potential TSX-related issues or go ahead with the firmware and look for alternatives . End-users are unlikely to be directly affected by the issue given that Broadwell and Haswell products ship mostly in consumer products and TSX-based applications are found mostly in businesses and enterprises . Intel told TechReport that the launch of the Haswell-EP processor range wo n't be delayed and that by the time , the Haswell-EX appears on the market , the TSX erratum will have been solved . Processors are so complex that it is almost impossible - and financially not viable - to keep the silicon die error free . Any given processor has dozens - if not hundreds - of those errors that have variable impact on performance and stability . Via TechReport

Lenovo has refreshed its ThinkStation workstation range with three new SKUs added to the portfolio , ranging from the P500 all the way to the top of the range P900 series . They complement the entry level P300 announced earlier this year . The announcement marks the first time a major PC maker has lifted the lid on a product based on Intel 's next generation Xeon processor , which is set to make its formal appearance over the next few weeks . All three new workstations will support the new Haswell-E Xeon with the P500 supporting one processor , while the P700 and the P900 are dual-capable . The latter , the company 's flagship workstation , comes with a 1.3KW PSU , supports up to 1TB DDR4 ( using 16 64GB DIMMs ) , houses up to four Nvidia K6000 cards , links to up to 14 storage devices ( with 12Gbps SAS and up to 32Gbps PCIe ) , has two GbE ports and a whopping 10 expansion slots . Lenovo 's designers have also worked hard on improving overall maintenance . The new range features a clean , modular design with tool-less upgrades integrated handles , QR codes for support questions and a handy diagnostic port ( to which you can connect an Android-device loaded with a ThinkStation app ) . The P Series workstations will be available later this year and Lenovo has yet to confirm the list price for the three workstations . A Xeon-based P300 currently retails for around £800 ( around $ 1400 , AU $ 1500 ) .

With the introduction of its latest processor , the Intel Core M ( or `` Broadwell , '' for those keeping up ) , Intel is just following the law - Moore 's law . Moore 's law states that the density of transistors in integrated circuits will double every two years , and Intel 's latest 14-nanometer process fits that road map nicely . With Broadwell 's official introduction as the Intel Core M the company is naturally promising a bevy of improvements over its last microarchitecture , including improved performance and decreased power consumption . Watch microscopic ( literally ) Intel Senior Fellow in the Technology and Manufacturing Group and Director of Process Architecture and Integration Mark Bohr explain it all in the video below . Intel 's new 14nm manufacturing process and improved transistor design make Broadwell its best chip yet , according to the company . It `` will usher in a wave of innovation , '' Intel said in the processor 's announcement , expecting systems that will be thinner , quieter and cooler . Cooler especially - the company said the Core M runs half as hot as previous generations . Intel promises the first Broadwell-equipped systems will arrive in time for the `` holiday selling season , '' so expect to see the new chip in devices slightly earlier than expected ( not that we 're complaining ) . The chip will get into the hands of more OEMs in 2015 , the company promised .

It 's not the first time that both Intel and Microsoft have seen their hegemonies jeopardised . The last one was back in the 1990s when Apple tried to single-handedly take them on with a PowerPC-powered , Mac OS-infused platform . The result was disastrous and pushed the Cupertino-based company to the brink of bankruptcy . Fast-foward to this decade and it is abundantly clear that the two compeers are once again facing the same sort of challenge that could permanently damage their business models . While Apple is still using Intel processors for a lot of its products , I predict that things will change in a near future as it unifies its operating system and the ARM architecture evolves and becomes significantly more powerful . And at the lower end , the rise of Android – which some would argue is just another Linux distribution - was the catalyst behind the rapid rate improvement of the ARM ecosystem . Cheap tablets and Chromebooks are proving to be alluring to a new generation of always-connected millennials that are not afraid of disrupting the status quo . Which brings us to our modest Pipo W2 Windows 8 tablet . This is a relatively decent tablet that can be purchased for about £100 online and comes with Windows 8.1 and a year 's subscription to Office 365 . Windows 8.1 costs a staggering £83 ( about $ 136 , AU $ 151 ) at Amazon while the 12-months subscription to Microsoft 's office suite comes in at just over £48 ( about $ 78 , AU $ 87 ) from the same retailer . it costs you significantly less to buy a tablet to get Windows and Office than to buy the three separately . In other words , Microsoft is giving away its software for very cheap or free ( although one can posit that the tablet is free when purchasing the OS and the subscription ) . Why ? To stem the rise of Google with its two-soon-to-become-one OSes , Android and ChromeOS . Microsoft bean-counters will almost certainly argue that the target market , especially in Asia , would probably have purchased pirated versions of Windows anyway . By giving the OS and Office for free , there 's always a chance of some converting to the full version , at which stage , which would translate into actual , tangible revenue . It is obvious that Microsoft is going for volume and market share at the expense of margins , something that Google has been doing all the way given that Android , and its associated services , are essentially free . As for the Pipo W2 , it is the first of a generation of affordable Windows tablets to come to the market , in an almost identical similar way to the netbooks back in the days . Other more recognised names – Lenovo , Toshiba , Acer – have already launched similar devices , although not as keenly priced . It is good enough for most users and those that want to swap a tablet for a traditional laptop , can do so for cheaper than ever . That 's another remarkable evolution in the PC market ; the proliferation of sub-£200 laptops with big screens and full size keyboards – but no Office subscription . Intel has been placing its bets cautiously as there 's a small but growing number of Intel-powered tablets running on Android as well . I do n't expect Android to help Intel shift the same volumes as Microsoft because of the intense competition in the SoC market . The pivotal moment might come later this year if/when Microsoft encourages vendors to switch from Android-only tablets to dual-booting Android and Windows in a bid to increase its market share as quickly as possible . As a conclusion , expect Microsoft and Intel to rekindle their relationship and to fight the combined threat of ARM and Google to the end , even if it means sacrificing margins in the medium term . Will Windows 9 come to super cheap tablets ? Well , we ca n't tell yet but at least you can read other random Windows 9 rumours here .

After Rockchip earlier this year , Intel has enlisted yet another Chinese fabless ARM partner to help it crack the Chinese market . This time though , there 's money on the table . Big money . Intel has commityed to invest RMB 9 billion ( $ 1.47 billion , £0.9 billion , AU $ 1.66 billion ) for roughly a fifth of the holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup which will own Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics . Both entities develop solutions for smartphones , tablets and other consumer electronic devices specifically for the Chinese market , with a wide array of connectivity options ( 2G , 3G , 4G ) . Spreadtrum made the headlines back in February by partnering with Mozilla on a $ 25 Firefox OS smartphone and while it is not well known outside the Chiese market , it did sell 350 million system-on-chips in 2013 , mostly to the Chinese market . Intel and Spreadtrum will jointly create and sell a family of Intel Architecture-based system-on-chips ( SoCs ) . SoFIA , Intel 's own family of integrated mobile SoC , was not mentioned in the press release but since the timeline mentions the second half of next year , highly likely that it will be the case .

This year 's Intel Developer Forum has seen a pretty significant amount of time given over to talking about PC gamers and the hardware they 're producing for that enthusiast market . On the back of the release of its eight-core/sixteen thread desktop processors though they 're also hoping that developers actually start to think more about multi-threading their game engines than just about straight clock speed . Kirk Skaugen , Intel 's Senior VP of its PC client group , called the PC 'the ultimate Darwinian device , transforming itself decade-after-decade . ' And when you think back to the first PC you ever had it 'll probably have about as much to do with your current rig as the old pocket calculator you used to type 5138008 into back at school . But where the hardware is iterating seemingly faster and faster , the software is simply not keeping up . When I 've been testing the Core i7 5960X I 've been blown away by it 's raw , multi-threaded processing performance . It 's frickin ' lightning quick . What it does n't do though is make your games run any faster than they would on a quad-core i5 . This is what prompted Skaugen to call out to the developers in the room – in two separate talks – to 'start thinking about threads , not just frequency . ' I asked Lisa Graff , Intel 's VP of its Desktop Client group , about what they could do regarding the stagnation of multi-threaded game engines . She had actually been out at PAX a couple of weeks previously launching Haswell E and talking with some of the big brains of PC games development . 'In their games they can take as much performance as we can possibly give them , ' she explained . 'Using all the single-threaded performance , the cores , all that kind of stuff . Not all games can do that , no question about it , I think that 's true . ' ' I think especially these bigger game developers do , ' she added . 'That will be an interesting trend for others to follow . ' Graff then is hoping getting the larger developers on board with creating properly multi-threaded engines will encourage smaller developers to do the same . Thankfully though it 's not just about Intel producing huge , hulking eight-core behemoths , or more affordable twelve-threaded processors , and then hoping the developers start taking advantage of the new PC hardware that 's available . Microsoft too have a role to play . The new DirectX 12 graphics API is all set to offer much easier paths to multi-threaded gaming . I spoke to Chris Silva , Director of Marketing for Intel 's Premium Notebooks , who 's very encouraged about the way it 's going . 'It used to be pretty difficult to do multi-threading , ' he explained . 'It 's been , what , ten years now we 've been trying to drive multi-threading . The tools are a lot easier now , it 's a lot easier to manage the different things going on in codes . DX12 is structured to allow easier segmentation of your code so that you can do multi-threading . ' Microsoft 's DirectX 12 is n't going to be a cure-all panacea for multi-core woes however . Despite the new API being designed to be optimised for multi-threading , the games need to be coded by developers to actually take advantage .

Just as Intel begins shipping its Broadwell CPUs early next year their successors will already be with software developers . Will there be any point in upgrading to the 5th Gen Core processors when a whole new 6th Gen Core architecture is potentially just six months away ? From a PC point of view , one of the exciting parts of Intel 's only keynote at this year 's IDF was the announcement that Broadwell 's 14nm process had finally hit volume production . That means 5th Gen Core desktop chips are coming early next year , hot on the heels of the li ' l Core M. Yay , we do so love a new performance processor . Only Intel 's Kirk Skaugen also announced that at the same time the Broadwell Core i3s , i5s and i7s are hitting the shelves , reference Skylake development platforms will be shipping out to software developers . Volume production , and launch , of the brand new Skylake processors will follow some six months later in the second half of 2015 . Skylake , the code-name for the 6th Gen Core CPUs , is a new microarchitecture , using the current 14nm production process . 'You should expect a significant increase in performance , in battery life , in power efficiency , ' says Skaugen . Broadwell though is only likely to offer a relatively small performance boost over the current Haswell chips . It is essentially the same architecture as Haswell , only shrunk down to the 14nm level from the existing 22nm process . Power efficiency is the name of the game then for Broadwell , only with a bit more of a straight performance boost on the GPU side of things . That 's going to make the top mobile part , the Core M , an outstanding high-end , fanless tablet chip , but on the desktop that does n't really amount to a lot when you just want more performance to justify your upgrade . In the standard configurations , possibly not , but there is at least one bright spot and that 's the prospect of a socketed Broadwell processor with the top end Iris Pro graphics inside . `` What we have n't had is the ability to have a socketed desktop processor with really high performance integrated graphics . '' Intel 's Lisa Graff told us at the show . `` Especially for desktop that will be the big hitter for us with Iris Pro graphics . '' In the previous Haswell generation you only had one option , the soldered-on i7 4770R that went into those pricey NUCs . With a socketed version you could drop it into a cheaper mini-ITX H97 and have yourself a teeny machine with some decent integrated GPU oomph . For the upgraders then that 's quite a tantalising prospect . While the CPU architecture of Broadwell has n't much changed from Haswell , bar the die-shrink , the GPU part seems to be aping the accelerated tick-plus change which occurred in the move from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge . The GT2 graphics in the normal Iris GPU component comes with another four extra execution units ( EUs ) , making a total of 24 , and so we expect the GT3e Iris Pro parts to come with around double that at 48 EUs . While you 're never going to be hitting 4K levels of PC gaming , the new Iris Pro will still be able to deliver decent 1080p performance , and hopefully this time around in a more affordable form on the desktop .

If you read our earlier coverage of IDF 2014 , you saw that Intel CEO Brian Krzanich predicted that there will be about 50 billion connected devices by the year 2020 . The strangest part of the prediction ? Not all of them will be made by major manufacturers . Some of them will be made by people like you and me - well , people like us with a little programming knowledge . Intel is prepared to meet Maker 's demands by launching Edison , an all-in-one development board that is on the border of rivaling some full-scale systems . The mini computer , unveiled at CES in January , will pack a 22nm Intel Atom dual-core System-on-Chip ( SoC ) clocked at 500MHz as well as a 32-bit Intel Quark processor MCU at 100 MHz and come with 1GB LPDDR3 POP memory , 4GB eMMC Storage and support dual-band Broadcom 43340 802.11 a/b/g/n Wifi and Bluetooth 4.0 . For all intents and purposes this is an x86 system . It should be able to run most Linux distributions quite comfortably and leave the maker with more than enough room on the chip for a fair bit of code . The code can either be uploaded via a device-to-device connection ( read : USB ) or download the aforementioned script from the cloud . Edison was the primary focus of a panel Tuesday entitled `` The Next Revolution in Computing : Edison , Wearable 's [ sic ] and New Devices , '' lead by Mike Bell , vice president at Intel of the company 's New Devices Group . Bell talked at length about how Intel is giving developers and makers more power than ever . The possibilities shown during the panel included a drone demo with person-tracking technology before shifting its focus to the company 's latest wearable , the Mica . The Mica , along with the SMS Headphones and Basis Watch , represent Intel 's growing interest in the wearable space . But just what , if anything , the company thinks of Apple 's new Watch is anyone 's guess . The Edison is available starting today and example projects can be found on Intel 's website .
What does Fashion Week , wireless charging technology and renowned physicist Stephen Hawking have in common ? Surprisingly , Intel . Intel CEO Brian Krzanich used his hour on stage at the IDF 2014 opening keybnote to tell a packed crowd about how the Internet of Things is growing and that Intel - with its newly branded Core M architecture - will be at the center of it . Krzanich made sure the usual suspects made their appearance - the DIY Arduino board , Edison ; a compelling argument for `` connected cities '' using Intel 's deployable City Sense Monitors ; and how data centers are processing the over 1 trillion transactions that come from our mobile devices on a daily basis . What we did n't see coming was a heartfelt speech from Stephen Hawking that told us how the physically disabled were benefiting from Intel technology and how you might be getting Intel `` Real Sense '' camera technology in your next tablet . I have a smartphone . You have a smartphone . Heck , my parents have smartphones . In this world of interconnectedness , we need hundreds of thousands of data centers to make sure we can check our Facebook wherever we may be . Krzanich said this Internet of Things or IoT has grown year on year 20 % and will exponentially increase until there are about 50 billion of these devices , seven per person in the entire world , by the year 2020 . Where does Intel fit into this ? Krzanich believes there needs to be both consumer and industrial standards for all this ... well , stuff . That 's why Intel is leading the charge on establishing an Open Interconnect Consortium and Industrial Internet Consortium as a way to create standards throughout the industry . How exactly this will come together and , more importantly , how it will impact each and every one of our handheld devices remains to be seen . But , if we put any stock in a stray McAfee logo that popped up over and over again throughout the presentation , it 's a safe bet `` safety '' is going to be one the committees ' primary concerns . It would n't be an Intel event if we did n't hear about the latest line of i3 , i5 and i7 processors and , thankfully , Krzanich did n't disappoint . We learned about the new 8 core , 16 thread Haswell-E line of processors a few weeks back that 's intended to tide us over until Broadwell chips go into production ( which , coincidentally , is sooner than you might think ) but it was the announcement that Broadwell has gone into full production that really had us on our feet . It was Intel Senior Vice President Kirk Skaugen that got to break the news about the Broadwell chips , while whetting our appetites for the new line of Intel Core M mobile processors that Intel claims can run circles around the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chips . Finally , Skaugen gave the audience more information about Intel 's new 14nm architecture called Skylake that hopes to cut cables - both power and data - when it drops in 2015 . This announcement was supplemented with a rather interesting wireless charging demo that showed a laptop charging through 2-inches of material . Last on Intel 's IDF 2014 docket was Real Sense - a new camera technology that can map out an object and give its close-to-perfect dimensions without the use of a measuring device . While this sort of advancement may not mean much to the average consumer , it has potential to make lives on the construction site exponentially easier . We will update this story and give you a first look at these products as we learn more here at IDF 2014 .

HP has a new line of productivity minded desktop and mobile workstations for those working on graphically intensive projects . First up HP has updated its desktop options with a top of the line Z840 tower that supports dual Intel Xeon CPU setup . This effectively allows the Z840 to pack 36 processor cores to render 2D and 3D models . Users will be able to deck out their production rig with Nivida and AMD graphics cards slotted into the Z840 's 10 expansion bays . Meanwhile , the machine 's 16 memory slots can hold up to 2TB of memory . The new Z840 also introduces Thunderbolt 2 allowing users to quickly move around their massive media files around . Of course , all this overbearing computing power is going to cost a pretty penny . The HP Z840 will be available this October starting at $ 2,399 ( about £1,483 , AU $ 2,575 ) . Users looking to pick up a workstation with a smaller footprint should look to the HP Z640 rackable minitower . Despite being smaller users will still be able to cram up to 36 processors into this machine . The only downside is there 's only room for eight memory modules and it has a few less expansion slots . The Z640 also comes at a lower price , starting at $ 1,759 ( about £1,087 , AU $ 1,888 ) . Lastly for less intensive work HP also has a HP Z440 workstation that should fill the needs of photoshoppers well with up to eight cores of processing power . The HP Z440 rings up to $ 1,499 ( about £926 , AU $ 1,609 ) at its base configuration . Aside from desktops HP has also introduced to new workstation laptops including the ZBook 15 G2 and ZBook 17 G2 . The new 15-inch production notebooks feature a 3,200 x 1,800 Quad-HD display . HP has also equipped its 17.3-inch offering with an optional HP DreamColor display for users who need accurate and consistent color in their workflow . As with HP 's latest desktops line , the ZBook also come with new drive options including a PCI express connected Z Turbo SSD drive and Thunderbolt 2 connectivity . The HP ZBook 15 G2 and ZBook 17 G2 will be available later this month with pricing options starting at $ 1,499 ( about £926 , AU $ 1,609 ) and $ 1,749 ( about £1,081 , AU $ 1,877 ) , respectively .

Similar to its great buddy Microsoft , Intel found itself horrifically late to the tablet party . Both companies had tried to push the form factor before . The 2002 's Tablet PC was a thick and clunky eight-year early tablet based around Windows XP Tablet Edition and failed to get any traction outside of businesses . Both companies made a fatal error at the time – they believed that people wanted tablets to do everything that a PC could . And , of course , that meant running Windows . Caught off guard by Apple 's iPad , both companies knew they needed to do something . The merits of Microsoft 's Windows 8 efforts aside , Intel 's strategy was to go after the lightweight fanless market with Atom and a spin on Ultrabooks with 2-in-1 tablet designs ( like Lenovo 's Yoga range and Surface Pro 3 , for example ) , essentially tablets with detachable keyboards The Atom experiment was a disaster ; some of the designs from well-known OEMs offered an extremely poor user experience for using Windows 8 . The CPU just was n't up to the job . The 2-in-1 market , however , is a sizable area of potential gain for Intel . The market is still very young , but the signs are encouraging – 50 per cent of people that have bought a 2-in-1 say they were previously considering a tablet , while there are more 70 system designs now on the market across all screen sizes . 2-in-1s are for people that still want to use x86 and x64 apps and have a device that can be used as a tablet . While Intel has long produced CULV ( Consumer Ultra-Low Voltage ) processors for tablets including the Haswell Core i3 , i5 and i7 variants in the Surface Pro 3 , something still needed to change . Intel has the computing power , but battery life was a major weakness until now . Enter the 14 nanometer die shrink of Haswell . Codenamed Broadwell , this is a launch that – relatively unusually for Intel in recent times - has been delayed , and after originally being promised the bulk of the CPUs ( including those for desktops and full laptops ) in late 2014 , these will most likely hit in early 2015 ( Intel says they `` will be in volume production before year end '' ) . We expect them to see a full launch at CES 2015 . But today sees an advance party for Broadwell in the form of Intel Core M. These Broadwell CPUs are designed specifically for tablets and 2-in-1s as well as very thin laptops ( whether they 'll fit into the Ultraboook category remains to be seen ) . And they 're fanless , yet with Core-level performance . The key to this is 14nm die shrink that has enabled the TDP ( thermal design power ) of the system-on-chip to sink below 6W and even down to 4.5W depending on design . This compares to TDPs of 17-18W only a couple of years ago . Improved packaging also enables more compact designs – the equivalent Haswell Core package was 960mm^2 , whereas Core M 's packaging is almost half that . This translates into designs that are designs that are thinner than 9mm . Intel sees the biggest market for 2-in-1s are people who bought a PC around 3-5 years ago and who are now looking to upgrade . Intel also believes Core M powered devices can entice those who were previously just looking for an Android or iOS tablet , but who value the multitasking value of Windows , flexible file storage and capabilities of a full Windows PC . Core M is available in dual core versions for now , the latter having 1.3 billion transistors . 4MB of L3 Cache is shared across the cores and the on-die graphics . Core M utilises Intel 's HD 5300 Graphics which supports resolutions up to 4K ( 3,840 vs 2,160 ) . There are three variants of the Core M ; 5Y70 , 5Y10a and 5Y10 ( capable of going to 4W ) . The key difference is the clock – 2.6Ghz for the 5Y70 , while the others are 2.0Ghz . All these chips are dual-core , four thread processors but expect some other variants as time goes on . With Core M , Intel is promising performance improvements for graphics and video of 7 % and a more modest increase of around 2 % for productivity tasks over ' a four year-old notebook ' – that 's comparing a Core M-5Y70 with the Core i5-520UM chip . The key thing here though is that there has been a significant reduction in TDP , 18W vs 4.5W . That power reduction means a significant uplift in battery life – Intel is talking somewhere in the region if 1.7 hours versus a previous generation system . As you can see from this chart , the main power consumer is the screen ( no surprise ) , but Broadwell brings a distinct saving when it comes to the system-on-chip as well as , interestingly , audio . This is down to Intel 's SmartSound audio processing technology that enables features such as wake -on-voice . Also part of the Core M platform is 802.11ac wireless ( Intel Wireless-AC 7265 ) and 5Y70 is compatible with Intel 's vPro for business deployments , Windows InstantGo and Platform Trust Technology . There 's also support for Intel 's Rapid Storage tech . As for pricing , Intel is predictably talking about the 2-in-1 market predominantly – machines around the $ 900 mark ( around £550 , AU $ 950 ) . But Intel reckons Core M could easily be homed in cheaper tablets – those around the $ 500 mark ( around £300 , AU $ 530 ) - and we 'll have to wait to see what OEMs announce in due course . Intel says somewhere in the region of 20 system designs are being developed using Core M and a handful of systems will arrive in October across both consumer and business SKUs . The first of these – launched at IFA 2014 - is the new-generation Lenovo ThinkPad Helix 2 in 1 that clocks in at 800g . It 's 9.6mm thick , with a 11.6-inch Full HD display .

Intel 's senior vice president and GM of personal computing , Kirk Skaugen , has launched its next generation of processors , coined the Core M . The new processor range will focus on three mobile segments ( convertibles , ultra portables , tablets ) , delivering what Intel says , is the most energy-efficient processor in the company 's history at 4.5W ( based on SPEC CPU2006 intel estimates for performance and core power . Interestingly , most of the demonstrations during the keynote were referring to laptop , convertibles and tablets with keyboards , with few tablets on their own . The Core M uses a 14nm manufacturing process and offers 50 % more CPU performance as well as 40 % faster graphics performance compared to last year 's Core i5-4302Y . Other advantages include significantly lower power consumption and consequently power dissipation ; that translates into a fanless design - which reduces the size and weight of the devices and improves reliability - as well as much better battery life . The Core M platform will also include support for high-quality audio , Wi-Di 5.0 , second generation 802.11ac with wireless docking WiGiG coming in the ( near ) future . Intel expects manufacturers to come out with tablet products less than 9mm thin ; that about the thickness of the Apple iPad 2 . More than 20 OEM products based on the Core M processor are expected to hit the shelves just in time for Christmas . One of the highlights of the keynote was the Llama Mountain reference device that is a 7.2mm tablet that 's only 670 grams , thanks to a motherboard package half the size . Three SKUs will be available at launch : The Intel Core M-5Y10 , the 5Y10a , both clocked at up to 2GHz and the M-5Y70 , clocked at up to 2.6GHz ; the latter also supports vPro , making it a good fit for business users . Intel also announced that it will provide with a $ 280 ( about £180 , AU $ 300 ) software bundle for SMEs called Small Business Program Partners Software Bundle for selected products .

While rival processor purveyor Intel may have had their day in the sun introducing the latest line of i7 processors at PAX Prime , AMD today announced a class of products for a different sector of the PC audience . Namely , it 's called the E-Series and it 's going to give budget-conscious PC builders a value option instead of opting for an admittedly more expensive Intel core i5 . The AMD FX-8370e and 8320e both stockpile up to eight Piledriver cores on their dies and , with some help from an R9 280x , boast some high results in games like Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare and upcoming Linchdom : Battlemage . Piledriver , it 's worth noting , is not actually the latest APU architecture - that honor is reserved for Kaveri . Why did n't AMD make an 8 core Kaveri system instead of pushing for Piledriver ? AMD Product Marketing Manager Adam Kozack told us that due to heat and die size constraints it just would n't be possible this time around , though it would n't be something we here at TechRadar would rule out for this time next year . The 95-watt E-Series processors will come in at just under $ 200 , with the 3.3GHz base speed 8370e retailing for $ 199 ( about £120 , AU $ 213 ) and the 3.2GHz 8320 going for $ 147 ( about £89 , AU $ 157 ) . Overclockers may be more excited to know that also en route this week is a standard , 125-watt AM3+ socket version of the 8370 that will retail for $ 199 ( about £120 , AU $ 213 ) . The E-Series and 125-watt 8370 are n't the only trick AMD has up its sleeve , though . Last year 's top dog , the 4.7GHz FX-9590 , is scheduled to drop down to $ 230 ( about £138 , AU $ 245 ) today as well .

Intel refreshed its public processor roadmap just over a week ago and while it does not reveal anything fundamentally new , it does show that the follow up to its Atom server SoC , the C2000 , has been postponed by almost a year . Denverton , which is supposed to be a refresh of the current Avoton family , has been pushed in 2015 according to the slide which covers the whole of 2014 and expires in Q1 2015 . Intel already confirmed at IDF last month that it will unveil a Broadwell-based system-on-chip under the Xeon banner and we now know that it will be called the D-1500 . Both Denverton and the new Xeon D part are expected to use about 15W of power and are likely to be fabbed at 14nm . It looks likely that the push is due to constrained capacity as Intel ramps up production of the Core M in time for the holiday season . Whether that delay will have any impact on Intel 's capacity to compete with ARM server parts remains to be seen . Cavium , AMD and Applied Micro all have parts on the market and HP is already using AM parts in its Moonshot servers .

The first Intel-powered HDMI dongle has gone on sale on a popular Chinese retailing website , and while it is still more expensive than other ARM-powered dongles , it is also far more powerful . The device , called the Meegopad T01 , is the first of many of its type that are likely to be built with an Intel Bay Trail Atom processor in the build up to Christmas . At $ 125 ( about £77 , AU $ 142 ) , it supports Windows 8.1 , Android and Linux , making it a more compelling option for businesses who might be interested in using it as a thin client like the Dell Wyse Cloud Connect . The rest of the configuration is reminiscent of what you could find in the Pipo W2 ( or indeed in any recently announced Baytrail-based tablet ) bar the display , the cameras and the battery . There 's either 1GB or 2GB of RAM , 16GB or 32GB onboard storage , a microSD slot , a HDMI port , Bluetooth 4.0 , Wi-Fi , two microUSB plus a USB 2.0 port and a 10W PSU . Intel is systematically going wherever ARM is going and offering a comparable alternative based mostly on its BayTrail Atom processor family .

A new version of the Samsung Chromebook 2 with Intel 's Celeron processor is now available for pre-order on Samsung.com and will be widely available the week of October 20 , the device maker has announced . The 11-inch Chromebook 2 ( model XE500C12 ) with Intel 's chip inside will retail for $ 249.99 ( about £155 , AU $ 285 ) . Intel 's Celeron is not exactly its most impressive processor , and it 's a bit of a shame Samsung is n't beefing up this Chromebook with the Intel Core i3 upgrade like some others are getting . And although the original , Exynos-powered Chromebook 2 launched in a 13-inch size , Samsung 's representatives confirmed with TechRadar that only the 11-inch book is getting the Intel upgrade . The Chromebook 2 is a predictable budget-friendly , web-powered Chromebook laptop , with one very distinctive feature : a faux-leather casing cover , similar to the Galaxy Note 3 's , that lends it a unique look . Add a 2.58GHz Intel Celeron chip to the Chromebook 2 's 11.6-inch 1366x768 display , 2GB of memory , and 16GB storage , and the laptop still does n't have much to write home about in the specs department . But it 's not bad either , and the Samsung Chromebook 2 's reported nine hours of battery life make its as portable and versatile as you expect from this class of laptop .

Intel 's third-Quarter revenue increased to $ 14.6 billion ( about £9.1 billion , AU $ 16.8 billion ) , an 8 % year-over-year bump , the company said . The company 's Q3 was driven in large part to a record number of shipped PCs and microservers . Operating income for the Santa Clara , Calif.-based company increased 30 % to $ 4.5 billion ( about £2.8 billion , AU $ 5.2 billion ) during the third quarter , compared to the same period in 2013 . Net income increased 19 % to $ 3.3 billion ( about £2.1 billion , AU $ 3.8 billion ) , during the quarter . The company 's PC Client Group business witnessed a 9 % year-over-year revenue increase , bringing the unit to $ 9.2 billion ( about £5.8 billion , AU $ 10.6 billion ) for the quarter . The PC Client Group is responsible for the following Intel products : notebooks ( including Ultrabook and 2 in 1 devices ) , desktops ( including all-in-ones and high-end PCs ) , wireless and wired connectivity products , and home gateway and set-top box components . During the quarter , notebook platform volumes increased 21 % from Q3 2013 to Q3 2014 , while notebook platform average selling prices decreased 10 % from Q3 2013 to Q3 2014 . Desktop selling volume increased 6 % during the period , while the average price of a desktop also increased 2 % . Intel 's data Center Group increased revenue 16 % to $ 3.7 billion , and the Internet of Things Group increased revenue 14 % to $ 530 million ( about £333 million , AU $ 609 million ) . Intel has been pushing wearable devices and connected machines heavily recently . During Q3 Intel launched Edison , an all-in-one development board that Intel hopes will power wearable devices . The company also paid $ 650 million ( about £400 million , AU $ 700 million ) for LSI 's Axxia Networking business and invested $ 1.47 billion ( about £0.9 billion , AU $ 1.66 billion ) in Chinese company Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics . For the first time , Intel sold more than 100 million microprocessors in a quarter . In July , Intel added 11 new SKUs to its mobile processor portfolio for all budgets , with three Celeron , one Pentium , three Core i5 and four Core i7 models . Software and services operating segments , which includes the McAfee division , increased revenue 2 % to $ 558 million ( about £350 million , AU $ 641 million ) .

Lenovo has introduced a refresh to its Yoga Pro range in the shape of the Yoga 3 Pro , which is more evolutionary , rather than revolutionary , compared to its predecessor the Yoga 2 Pro . Launched at an event in London , the new device has been an upgraded to include a new hinge design . Moving from a two focus-point model to a six focus-point apparently helped enginners make the machine thinner and lighter . The Yoga 3 Pro is 17 per cent lighter ( at 1.19Kg ) , a mere 12.8mm thick , and 14 % thinner than its predecessor . The only other downside is that the battery is smaller ( 44Whr compared to 54Whr ) , which partly explains how Lenovo engineers managed to shave around 200g and 2mm off the machine . Inside , the biggest change is the inclusion of Intel 's Broadwell-based , Core M processor , the M-5Y70 , the most powerful of the three Core M processors currently on the market . It is a two-core/four-threads model with a TDP of only 4.5W . It packs 4MB cache , lists a default clock speed of 1.1GHz and a maximum turbo frequency of 2.6GHz . It also includes an Intel HD Graphics 5300 that supports up to three displays . Other than that , the rest is very similar to the Yoga 2 Pro : up to 8GB of LPDDR3L , a 256GB SSD , a 13.3-inch QHD+ display , two USb 3.0 ports , a card reader , micro-HDMI out , HD webcam , JBL speakers , Bluetooth 4.01 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi . Lenovo will ship the laptop with Windows 8.1 and quotes a 9-hour battery life . The Yoga 3 Pro will also be bundled with Lenovo 's Harmony , an `` intuitive '' software that displays apps differently according to the screen modes . The Yoga 3 Pro carries a MSRP of $ 1,349 ( about £840 exc . VAT , AU $ 1540 ) and should be available over the next few weeks .

IBM will launch a range of servers that process data faster ( and 20 % less expensively ) than Intel Xeon v3 Processor-based servers , the company said in a statement . The Power8 processor-based servers , which IBM will make generally available at the end of the month , are built to handle big data workloads . IBM claims the servers , particularly the top-of-the-line GPU-accelerated S824L , can run millions of data computations in parallel . IBM will also launch the Power System S822L , which is built to deploy NoSQL databases at a lower cost by combining Redis Labs software , Canonical 's Ubuntu Linux operating system , and Altera 's FPGAs with IBM 's FlashSystem 840 . The cost savings occur because the combined systems enable one server to be used to manage an infrastructure typically required for two dozen Intel servers , IBM said . The new Power E870 and Power E880 Systems offer support for up to 1,000 VMs per system . Companies can choose from 32 , 40 or 48 processor cores and up to 4 TB per compute node . IBM sold its x66 server unit to Lenovo for $ 2.1 billion in January . As part of the acquisition , IBM relinquished its System x , BladeCenter and Flex System blade servers and switches , 86-based Flex integrated systems , NeXtScale and iDataPlex servers and associated software , blade networking and maintenance operations . IBM remains a major server manufacturer with the following lines-of-business : System z mainframes , Power Systems , Storage Systems , Power-based Flex servers , Pure Application and PureData appliances . Worldwide server revenue is expected to eclipse $ 50 billion worldwide in 2014 , according to IDC . HP is the market leader in the space , with 25.4 % of total revenue . IBM , which is a close second at 23.6 % , saw revenue decrease 10 % in Q2 .

Intel could merge its mobile division and its PC division to create a Client Computing Group CCG that would be led by Kirk Skaugen , the current head of Intel 's PC division . The changes are likely to happen early next year , with the announcement likely to happen at CES in Las Vegas . The Mobile and Communications Group ( MCG ) is expected to be broken up with SoC development being combined in the CCG . The rest of the MCG ( focusing mostly on comms and RF technologies ) will be the backbone of a new wireless group . What motivated the move ? Other than the fact that it allows Intel to discreetly hide the fact that it is losing billions on mobile ( mostly because of subsidies to tablet vendors ) , the new strategy indicates that the Santa Clara-based company wants to put mobile and desktop ( and server ) on equal footing . That means access to the latest fab technologies as well as having more common DNA across Core and Atom like higher IPC or better integration techniques , power usage or heat dissipation . Also because AMD is no longer as big of a competition , Intel can afford to focus its resources elsewhere , where it matters , i.e . mobile . Why Intel 's Bay Trail is the next big thing in mobile computing
Lenovo has announced that it partnered with Intel to produce its own Xeon , the E5-2698A v3 . Oracle ( the E7-8890 v2 ) and Amazon ( E5-2666 v3 ) have already announced similar partnerships and it looks like others will follow as well . The proliferation of SKUs is going to make it more difficult to compare systems directly since these processors are customised for one vendor and the actual specs are not disclosed . Lenovo says that its Xeon is the highest-performing two-socket server platform - when installed with Water Cool Technology ( WCT ) - allowing it to reach a whopping 1.083 teraflops . The chip looks like a variant of the existing E5-2698 v3 , a 16-core Haswell based model that is clocked at 2.3GHz with a turbo-boosted speed of 3.6GHz . Lenovo says that its model can only reach 3.2GHz with turbo mode enabled . Lenovo 's new chip will only be available in specially designed servers such as its own NeXtScale system , which it says cuts power consumption at CPU level by six percent and at data-centre level by more than 40 percent . The launch was done at Supercomputing 2014 where the Chinese company showcased a petaflop computer that is only three cubic metres announced that it was going to open a HPC innovation center in Stuttgart Germany .

Amazon revealed that Intel has built a custom , Haswell-based processor called the Xeon E5-2666 v3 , one that will deliver compute-optimised EC2 instances called C4 . The processor runs at a base clock speed of 2.9GHz and can reach clock speeds of up to 3.5GHz . The processor will power instances with a two vCPU count all the way up to 36 with up to 60GB RAM on the latter and 10Gbps network connectivity . Not much is known about that processor ; the 2663 model is a 10-core , 10 thread model with a base clock speed of 2.8GHz . a turbo frequency of 3.5GHz and 25MB L3 cache while the 2667 one has a lower core count ( eight ) but more threads ( 16 ) with a higher base frequency ( 3.2GHz ) and a turbo frequency of 3.6GHz . Amazon is not the first big custom CPU client Intel has enlisted ; earlier in July , the company confirmed that it build a Xeon E7-8890 v2 CPU for database giant , Oracle . What 's interesting with both of those chips is that they contain an onboard FPGA that provides it with a degree of flexibility , allowing the hardware to be tweaked on-the-fly without the need for a reboot . Intel has secured more than 30 custom product wins in 2014 , more than double what it achieved in 2013 .

Intel has unveiled a new smartband called `` My Intelligent Communication Accessory , '' or `` MICA '' for short , that it hopes will grab a previously unimpressed demographic for wearables . The smartband is a luxury item being marketed specifically toward fashion-minded females . It 's a standalone wearable that uses an AT & T data connection and does n't need to be tethered to a smartphone . And Intel designed MICA with help from fashion brand Opening Ceremony , so you know it 's in style . Intel unveiled MICA today in San Francisco after first mentioning it at IDF 2014 in September . The smartband comes in a couple of styles made with materials including snakeskin , lapis stones , obsidian , and an 18k gold finish , with a 1.6-inch OLED display , a custom Linux OS and two days of battery life . As far as actual connectivity it supports texts , phone calls , Facebook , email , and Google notifications , plus smart reminders that use location data as well as data from Yelp . Intel 's MICA will be available in early December for $ 495 ( about £315 , AU $ 570 ) in Barneys stores and Opening Ceremony stores in LA and New York , plus online at the two brands ' websites . That price also includes a two-year AT & T 3G data plan .
Anonymous sources have leaked what look like genuine roadmaps of Intel 's Quark product family on the popular Chinese social network Weibo ' these point out to an acceleration in the rate of development . Intel has apparently cancelled its Dublin Bay application specific standard processor , which was supposed to be the follow-up to its current Quark X1000 and instead bring in a whole set of new features ( coupled with an increase in performance ) but losing out on pin-compatibility . `` Liffey Island '' , which is expected to land sometimes in 2015 , will still feature a Pentium-class core with ECC support , a 2W TDP , up to 512KB L2 cache and a flurry of I/O interfaces as well as AMBA compatibility . Its follow-up , Seal Beach , is set to be released in 2016 and will see the introduction of SSE2 instructions as well as a 2D/3D graphics controller . The path followed by Quark loosely resembles that of the Atom processor but with a much thinner manufacturing process and a more conservative target market . One wonders whether Intel 's commitment to deliver these two generations will be enough to counter ARM as well as a resurgent MIPS . Source : Kitguru

Acer has previewed a new version of its Aspire Switch 2-in-1 hybrid laptop . The new 12.5-inch model , appropriately dubbed the Aspire Switch 12 , is a revamp of the Switch 10 , which Acer released earlier this year . The Switch 12 , which features a detachable keyboard , full 1,920 x 1,080 resolution screen and an Intel Core M processor , can be manipulated to offer five different viewing modes . Like the Switch 10 , the Switch 12 can be positioned as a laptop and tablet , but because its screen can rotate 360-degrees and rest on a kickstand , it can also flip into display , tent and desktop formats . The new model features an 8-hour battery life and comes with 30 GB or 120 GB SSD storage . The device will first be released in Europe , the Middle East , Africa and Asia during Q4 , and it will cost $ 810 ( about £500 , AU $ 930 ) , according to ComputerWorld . Not only is the Switch 12 larger , but its display blows the Switch 10 's 1,366 x 768 resolution out of the water . The Switch 12 and its fanless Intel Core M processor should be a lot quieter than the Switch 10 , which runs on an Atom CPU processor and requires a cooling fan . Hopefully there 's more to the new model than just a new screen and fanless design . When we conducted a hands-on review of the Switch 10 back in April , we found the $ 379.99 ( about £225 , AU $ 409 ) model to be appropriately priced , but lacking the under-the-hood specs to create any noise on the market . It 's disappointing to hear that Acer did n't improve upon the 8-hour battery life , especially considering it will cost almost double the price . But perhaps by the time the model hits the US it will have gone through an additional upgrade .

Intel will launch a new version of Edison , one that is likely to be much smaller than the current version and may be unveiled by the end of next year . Speaking at the company 's `` Make It Wearable challenge '' in San Francisco , Brian Krzanich , the company 's CEO , stated that `` We 'll have a better Edison in 2015 that will be smaller , '' before adding `` I still have the vision that we can take all of the functionality we have on Edison today and put it in something that 's roughly the size of your coat button '' . The new Edison , Krzanich reckons , will run on a battery about the same size for a coupole of days , which means , he continued , that you will be able to run a computer in your coat button . Now a coat button ( not a shirt button ) is about the size of a 3V CR2016 battery , a 20mm model that 's 1.5mm thick and has a typical capacity of 90mAh . The current Edison PC was originally supposed to be the size of a SD card but ended up being a tad bigger.. Krzanich also revealed that Intel is working on two different ways of improving battery life on wearable devices , with devices based on these coming out in 2015 . He stated `` You can have an analogue part that 's always listening and always sensing , that 's very low power . Then if it sees something , whatever your sensor is monitoring , then this turns the digital side on . '' Via Stuff

Intel 's head honcho for anything data-centre related has confirmed that the company is betting big on semi-custom designs for next year . Diane Bryant told the New York Times that she expects half of the chips it sells to public clouds to use custom designs . That amounts to about nine million units annually . Intel 's top clients , those that can order hundreds of thousands of chips , include Amazon , Google , Microsoft , Facebook ( but not Apple ) as well as Tencent , Alibaba and Baidu . Outside this group are about 200 other public cloud providers including the likes of Ebay , Twitter , Oracle or Lenovo . `` The name of the game is customisation '' , she said in an interview . Intel chip factories ( or fabs as they are known ) are now so automated that they allow for models to be tweaked with very little overhead , although the manufacturer is likely to charge a premium . That allows for a much higher average selling price and profit margin . Perhaps more importantly , it allows Intel to cement its position in the cloud-market against the potential competition coming from ARM partners like AMD , Qualcomm or Applied Micro , all of which have been eyeing a slice of the booming DC market .

Intel is yet to announce its next-generation NUC micro-PCs , but that has n't stopped the new machines from cropping up on the chipmaker 's website ahead of schedule . As noted by Legit Reviews , the diminutive desktops are more than likely the ones rumoured to launch in early 2015 with Intel 's new Broadwell processor inside . The NUC micro site shows that the new systems have two USB ports ( one yellow , one blue ) on the front alongside an audio/headphone jack . It 's available in three different chassis , one of which stands on its side and is slimmer and taller than the other two . Back in August , FanlessTech leaked Intel slides that showed two 'immersive gaming ' Broadwell-powered NUC 2.0 models , codenamed Rock Canyon , were scheduled for a Q1 2015 launch with support for 2.5-inch drives and Intel Core-i3 or Core-i5 processors . Intel 's NUC systems come with basic components such as a processor and integrated graphics , allowing users to fit them with storage drives , RAM and other components .

Intel has worked with Professor Stephen Hawking to develop an open-source solution that could help 3 million people afflicted with Motor Neuron Disease ( MND ) and quadriplegia communicate and use computers more easily . Called ACAT ( Assistive Context Aware Toolkit ) , the system took three years to develop and has replaced Hawking 's existing system that was developed by Intel 20 years ago . It has allowed the professor , who is almost entirely paralysed due to an MND-related condition called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) , to perform many actions on a computer faster – from communicating with others through a software-based voice synthesiser to navigating emails , documents and the web , as well as performing other common tasks . Hawking controls a computer by using muscle movements in his cheek , which are detected using an infrared sensor mounted on his glasses , to select on-screen text as a cursor hovers over it . According to Intel , it has been drastically improved through the integration of text prediction software Swiftkey , which has doubled the professor 's speech rate by adapting to his lexicon . Hawking explained at the event that his old system was making it `` very difficult to communicate effectively and to do the things I love to do . '' He added : `` With the improvements inside , I am now able to write much faster and it means I can continue to give lectures , write papers and books and , of course , speak with my family and friends more easily . The new system is life-changing for me , and I hope it will serve me well for at least 20 years . '' The new toolkit is open source and Intel is hoping that researchers and technologists will be able to use it to create customised solutions operated through touch , eye blinks , eyebrow movements and other inputs for communication .

Intel has purchased password management company PasswordBox , although the terms of the deal - and Intel 's full intentions here - were not disclosed . PasswordBox is a cross-platform tool that sets up tough-to-crack passwords for all the apps and websites you use . Intel says it wants to extend PasswordBox 's reach to more customers , and it 's adding the company to the Intel Security Group 's Safe Identity organization . That group `` is committed to delivering solutions that reduce the pain of passwords , simplify and strengthen security and providing consumers with easy access to their digital lives , '' reads an Intel press release , and no doubt PasswordBox will help further those goals . Intel laid out its general plan for PasswordBox , but failed to mention anything concrete . PasswordBox generates passwords and then fills them in automatically for users on mobile and desktop devices , and Intel says it plans to `` extend and expand '' that capability . Intel will also use PasswordBox 's inherent simplicity to make the authentication process more simple , the company 's announcement says . `` Intel Security and PasswordBox share the same goal of improving digital identity protection across all devices and platforms , '' Intel Security Group Senior Vice President and General Manager Chris Young said in the announcement . `` We believe we have the technology , expertise and reach to bring simple , secure access to consumers worldwide .

Google is set to launch a new version of its Glass wearable next year this time powered by an Intel processor . The new version of Glass will offer better battery life than the current Explorer Edition that 's available to buy for £1,000 ( $ 1,500 ) as well as a refreshed design , according to a report in the Wall Street Journal . Rather than a consumer-focused device , the new partnership with Intel seems to position Glass as a piece of professional equipment . The WSJ reports that the two companies want to bring Glass to hospital networks , manufacturers as well as develop new workplace uses for the wearable . There 's no word on specifically what Intel hardware will be inside the new model , but The Verge has speculated that the company might use the same low-power chip from the Intel MICA bracelet . Google has already refreshed Glass a couple of times , the most notable addition being extra RAM . But even with the boosted memory the uses of the headset are , for the most part , limited . And with such a steep retail price , Intel and Google have an uphill battle to secure mass adoption next year .

Intel 's fifth-generation Core vPro platform allows PC makers to create slimmer business-focused laptops and 2-in-1s . Another , arguably more interesting advantage that it brings is the ability for users to wirelessly display content on TVs or monitors using vPro 's Pro Wireless Display ( or Pro WiDi ) feature , which looks to eliminate cabling between devices and displays . The idea is that employees can shuffle into conference rooms and instantly begin collaborating and working on ideas without wasting time trying to locate physical cables and dongles . Combined with Wi-Dock , a wireless docking feature in vPro that sees users ' laptops or tablets instantly connect to displays when sat within range , Intel reckons the small time savings accumulated could lead to increased productivity over time and larger profits as a result . Intel has said that businesses and education authorities need to buy a WiDi Pro dongle adapter to slot into the HDMI port of the TV , PC monitor or projector and receive the image from vPro-enabled devices . Actiontec , the chipmaker 's main lead WiDi Pro partner , is the first to launch an adapter and will be followed by OEMs later this year . To find out more about WiDi Pro , TechRadar Pro spoke to Jim Russell from Intel 's vPro Expert Centre , and Jay Taylor , Director of Strategic Alliances at Actiontec . TechRadar Pro : What 's the difference between Intel WiDi Pro and Intel Wireless Docking ? Jim Russell : Intel The Wi-Dock is geared toward office environments and fairly short distances , so it 's about huge speed but more for one person in their office . The Pro WiDi is meant for conference rooms with people at greater differences . You can go around 30 metres and still be connected to it . WiDi also allows multi-connect with up to 16 people connected , and you can transition between different presenters . It 's really more meant for collaborative environments -- a no-wire solution for the conference room , where as the WiDock is a no-more wires solution for the office . People will already be familiar with WiDi as it allows you to extend or mirror your desktop content exactly as you would in Windows 8.1 . TRP : What wireless frequency band and channel does the Actiontec adapter run on ? JR : The adapter runs on the 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands . Channel assignment is done by IT — it 's not up to the individual to configure infrastructure — it 's designed to be invisible to the user . When you buy it , it comes with the default channel . IT needs to configure the channel and its name — so you would put a conference room like room 101 or room 102 . It helps not to put something cryptic . TRP : How will workforces be able to manage multiple devices ? JT : Remote management is a key feature that Actiontec has built into these devices . We 've enabled a CMS — Central Management System —- that allows IT administrators to see every deployed device . They can set security and management policies and turn on and off different Pro WiDi features — such as being able to push firmware updates and set custom splash screens and images from a central location . For large deployments devices can be managed through a central systems . TRP : Can organisations deploy that application on-premise ? JT : In some cases you can and in some cases you ca n't . It can run on a virtual server in a window console , which shows the devices as soon as you plug them in . You can rename them and do what you want in batches . TRP : How will Actiontec 's WiDi adapter be sold into organisations ? JT : In a number of a different ways . For example , if you look to Toshiba , Dell or Lenovo , they 're selling our branded adapter through their online stores . Some manufacturers may do a bundle , so for every 10 devices you buy you may get a free adapter . It 's all about the solution , and understanding the needs of the consumer -- the customer in this particular case . Businesses do n't have to go through an OEM to get it -- they can get it through a reseller , system integrator or whoever they want to do the integration . TRP : Companies other than Actiontec will be selling devices soon . Are there any requirements for what they must do to support WiDi ? JT : Other adapters have to meet certain requirements and have an opportunity to differentiate . Actiontec is Intel 's lead partner having helped develop the technology . We 've overseen aspects such as performance and reliability , and have done a ton of testing on HP , Dell and any other systems we can get our hands on to ensure the greatest range of flexibility to make sure these things just work . There 's an enormous amount of engineering work takes place , and then we work with Intel on the business side , working with sales organisations and distribution channels .

Everybody knows that in business , time is money , a message that Intel spent almost two hours communicating at the launch of its fifth-generation vPro processor in London . The latest version of the chipmaker 's business-focused CPU aims to deliver the company 's vision of a no-wire workplace , where employees can connect laptops and tablets to displays and projectors without wasting time fiddling with cables and dongles . Intel Pro WiDi is the technology that lies at the heart of this vision . It allows content to be beamed from vPro-powered devices to HDMI-equipped TVs and monitors using a compatible adapter , the first of which is being launched by California-based Actiontec -- and Intel says that third-party alternatives are on the way . Speaking at the launch , head of Intel 's Business Client Platforms group , Tom Garrison , noted how vPro 's wireless capabilities can allow businesses to take advantage of the increasingly common trend of downsizing to cut costs on office real-estate . He said : `` Initially the motivations around workplace transformation was real-estate savings , getting them into smaller and more confined areas to save on costs , but one of the side benefits of that was around collaboration and creativity . `` [ vPro ] allows you to capitalise on those savings -- not only in having multiple employees using a singe workspace -- but also saving cost on docks . Until recently you would might have a dock from one OEM , and then a second docking solution from another OEM . Multiple docks would have been cost prohibitive , so this enables IT to deploy a single solution . '' In a video that began to roll , one HP executive estimated that the company could save half a billion dollars on the back of employee productivity gained per year . WiDi aside , other vPro benefits mirror the advantages seen in consumer laptops housing Intel 's fifth-generation Core-M CPU -- namely slimmer and lighter devices with longer battery life . Garrison showed off four of them , with each one demonstrating a particular advantages introduced by fifth-generation vPro -- including HP 's `` thin and light '' Elitebook 1020 and HP Elite X2 convertibles -- in addition to Lenovo 's Helix 2-in-1 which offers up to eight or 12 hours of battery life depending whether used in tablet or laptop mode . Intel now claims to have shipped more than 100 million vPro-powered devices , something that Garrison said should give developers and ISVs ( independent software vendors ) confidence that their applications will be optimised with vPro-enabled devices . Additional savings could be found in the costs saved from managing such a number of devices , he added , particularly in instances where enterprises are deploying anything from 50 to 160,000 clients at a particular time .

Intel is quietly building up its range of NUCs ( Next Unit of Computing ) with not one but six new Broadwell-based stock-keeping units . Three of them are Core i5 models and two are Core i3 ones ; the most interesting unit however is one based on a Core i7 processor with an empty 2.5-inch hard drive bay . The NUC5i7RYH will land in the second half of the year with a suggested retail price likely to be high . Current models from Zotac and Gigabyte retail for anywhere between £400 and £500 , a price that excludes the OS license and any component ( memory , hard drive ) or peripheral ( keyboard , mouse ) . All the new NUCs support up to 16GB of system memory , 2.5-inch drives , M.2 SSD as well as providing with four USB 3.0 ports , 802.11ac , a VESA mount , three year warranty and for some of them , mini HDMI and mini DisplayPort . The NUC fill a nice gap between traditional desktop-size computers ( down to USFF sizes ) and the growing number of Windows-based , Intel-powered HDMI dongles that provide convenience without the associated cost .

Fujitsu has unveiled a new Stylistic tablet , two new Lifebook convertible laptops , and an Ultrabook running Intel 's latest fifth-generation Core processors known as Broadwell . Broadwell 's biggest appeal is stronger battery life , and Fujitsu claims up to 20-hour computing time on the Lifebook T935 convertible . The enterprise class systems are equipped with Intel 's vPro technology and come with security features such as Smart Card readers , embedded TPM , encrypted drives , and fingerprint scanners . Read more : Fujitsu Lifebook U939X 2-in-1 convertible business laptop The range of devices include an Ultrabook-class Lifebook T935 2-in-1 with a swiveling tablet hinge , a Lifebook T725 2-in-1 with modular expansion bay , the 14-inch Ultrabook Lifebook U725 , and a detachable Stylistic Q775 2-in-1 . Both 2-in-1 hybrid systems feature a bi-directional rotating hinge to convert the laptops into tablet mode . Fujitsu is highlighting the MIL-STD testing and features like strengthened glass displays and spill-resistant keyboards for road warriors on both systems . The 13.3-inch T935 features a premium design with materials like magnesium housing and an aluminum palm rest that help keep the thickness at just 0.75 inches ( 1.9 cm ) . Though this model will give you up to 20 hours of power on a single charge , mobile users will appreciate the removable battery in the T935 , allowing you to carry a spare when you run out of power . Trading in the slimness of the T935 , the 12.5-inch T725 is a no-compromise system with 15-hour battery life and a multitude of expansion options . The modular bay in the T725 can be used to accommodate a second battery while the Lifebook E Series docking station expands the number of available ports when you 're using the T725 in the office . Both models also support optional built-in 4G LTE mobile broadband connectivity . Targeting users of the competing Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon , Fujitsu is billing its U745 as a 14-inch business-class Ultrabook . The 0.75-inch ( 1.9 cm ) thick U745 features an HD+ anti-glare display with optional touchscreen configuration and the same magnesium housing and aluminum palm rest as the Lifebook T935 2-in-1 . With easy access to the battery , memory , and internal storage , users or IT departments can upgrade to a larger capacity SSD or change to a spare battery in the field if needed . A legacy VGA port is also found on the system , allowing easy connection to projectors . For additional ports , the U745 works with the Lifebook E Series docking station . A backlit keyboard is not a standard option on this device and unlike the 2-in-1 , the U745 does n't benefit from a more rugged MIL-STD tested design . For security , the U745 also has an option for a palm vein scanner . Unlike the Lifebook T935 and T725 convertibles , the Stylistic Q775 's hybrid design allows you to detach the 13.3-inch display from the keyboard dock for tablet use . Boasting a semi-rugged design , the Q775 has a strengthened 13.3-inch glass display and MIL-STD tested design . The Q775 also features support for pen input . The optional Shell Concept adds Smart Card , Palm Vein , mounting and mag stripe shells for different computing environments . All systems will be coming in February of this year except the the Stylistic Q775 , which will arrive in March . Fujitsu has not announced pricing for any of the systems at this time . For comparison , the base model Ultrabook Lifebook U904 that we reviewed came with a suggested retail price of $ 1549 ( around £1363 or AU $ 1660 ) .

Intel one-upped itself at CES 2015 , announcing a new wearable module that can fit on devices no bigger than a coat button . Called Curie , the module shown onstage during the company 's keynote was only a prototype , but the potential feels very real . CEO Brian Krzanich provided a visual comparison between Edison , announced at last year 's CES , and Curie . The difference was remarkable . `` We knew we could do better , '' Krzanich said of the Edison to Curie evolution . `` We knew we could make computing and compute smaller . '' Curie is based on Intel 's Quark SoC , and Krzanich said another dedicated processor can quickly and precisely identify different sporting activities . Wearing Curie during the keynote , Krzanich was able to record how many steps he took onstage . Bags , pendants and jacket buttons could all house Curie , Krzanich mused . `` It changes the game of wearables , '' he said . Curie arrives in the second half of the year , and Intel already lined up eyewear company Oakley to make `` an intelligent product '' aimed at athletes . Other brands , like Basis Peak , the Fossil Group and SMS Audio are part of Intel 's Curie push . Curie was n't the only thing Intel had to show . Krzanich and a host of guests touched on a host of technologies , including the company 's RealSense cameras and applications based around the technology . The most entertaining demonstration of RealSense 's capabilities centered around drones . Equipped with RealSense cameras , the drones could maneuver around obstacles and avoid running into people and closed doors with no one controlling them . It was impressive , if not a little creepy . Another demonstration showed a RealSense application in the kitchen ; a chef could call up a recipe video on a ThinkPad tablet , pause it and navigate a page on the Food Network with just his voice and hand gestures , no need to smudge the screen with chicken wing sauce . Krzanich said more RealSense-equipped products from seven Intel partners , including Acer , Asus , Lenovo , HP and Dell , are due this year . Dion Weisler , executive vice president , printing and personal systems at HP , revealed the company is entering the 3D printing space with its Multi Jet Fusion printer , powered by a Core i7 processor . Finally , Intel announced it 's partnered with Marriott to launch a wireless charging initiative that will eventually reach Hilton , Jaguar Land Rover , Dupont , and the San Francisco airport . The program will launch in Marriott properties in Q2 this year .

Details of the 14nm successor to the current Bay Trail family have emerged in Singapore courtesy of online website , VR-Zone . Top of the agenda for Intel 's answer to ARM 's growing armada of system-on-chip will be power saving tweaks as well as graphics performance improvement . Cherry Trail-T is likely to have twice the number of graphics core , each of them being a Gen8 one ( rather than the current Gen7 model ) . It will also support HDMI 1.4b which adds enhanced 3D capabilities . As for the power tweaks , a lot of it is likely to come from the graphics department itself including Intel 's 6th generation display power saving technology which will look at drastically reducing backlight without any noticeable impact on quality . Another way of decreasing power consumption will be to adapt refresh rates according to content being displayed . An idle system will have a lower refresh rate ( hence consuming less energy ) . Intel confirmed yesterday that Cherry Trail will include RealSense technology , no wires , no password as well as Intel 's Context Aware technology capabilities . Products with Cherry Trail inside – which share the DNA as the 5th generation Intel Core family - will be available in the first half of 2015 . They will target tablets initially , offering 64-bit computing capabilities as well as LTE-advanced connectivity .

Intel has unveiled its fifth generation Core processor family , commonly known as Broadwell-U , one that supersedes Ivy Bridge and complements the company 's existing Core M processor range – which targets products focused on mobility . The new processors are generally smaller than their previous counterparts while cramming significantly more transistors ( 35 % more transistors on a die that 's 37 % smaller ) . While productivity benchmarks are almost flat ( up by 4 % ) , others like video conversion ( 50 % faster ) , 3D graphics ( up 22 % ) and battery life ( up 90 minutes ) shows that Intel 's 5th generation CPU is going the right way . Beyond the introduction of these new processors though is the promise of augmented functionality across the board . A quick look at the processor map shows that the actual CPU only occupy a very small faction of the die . Expect much better graphics performance with DirectX 12 baked in and 4K resolution promised even in Wireless Display mode as well as improved sound with its smart sound technology . There 's also a number of associated technologies that Intel expects its partners to roll out together with Broadwell-U . These will include RealSense , Voice assistant , Wireless Gigabit Docking and Biometric password capabilities . Products have already started shipping ( with high end laptops like the new Thinkpad X1 Carbon likely to be the first candidates ) . Expect many more to come over the next few months and in the build up to Windows 10 .

To make it easier for consumers to understand the different performance levels of its mobile and tablet processors , Intel is splitting its Atom brand into three lines . Starting with the next generation Atom Cherry Trail - we 're currently on Bay Trail - Atom CPUs will be classified as the Atom x3 , Atom x5 , and Atom x7 , rather than the confusing number scheme used today . Under the new classification , the higher the number , the more performance of the Atom processor . Intel 's Atom chips are designed for lower power consumption while delivering performance to compete against chipsets based on architecture from ARM . As such , Atom is designed for phones , phablets and tablets . Intel does n't mention that the x3 , x5 , and x7 Atom processors will be headed to netbooks , low cost laptops , and Chromebooks in its infographics . Intel claims the Atom x3 will offer basic performance with an x86 architecture . The x5 offers `` more capabilities and features for people who want an even better experience , '' while the Atom x7 is the flagship chip in the line . For those who want higher performance , Intel offers Core m and Core i processor series for convertibles , hybrids , laptops and Ultrabooks . Both Intel Core series offer more performance than the Atom chipset , but come at an increased cost . The Core m processor combines the benefits of longer battery life and a fanless design from the Atom series with the increased performance from the Core i series . We reviewed the Dell Venue 11 Pro 7000 series with a Broadwell-based Core m processor and appreciated the lighter , thinner fanless design , longer battery life than the Core i5 model of the same tablet , and performance that almost matches the Core i5 . The Core i series will offer the best performance , but those chipsets are designed for premium notebooks and Ultrabooks . Cherry Trail is Intel 's newest processor design for Atom . Earlier this year at the Consumer Electronics Show , Intel announced devices running on Cherry Trail Atom processors will arrive within the year . With Cherry Trail , Intel is shrinking its processor architecture from 22nm to just 14nm , offering better efficiency in battery life and better performance . Cherry Trail is based on the x86 architecture and is designed to work with both Windows and Android . Cherry Trail , like the Atom Bay Trail that it succeeds , will be able to run the full versions of Microsoft 's Windows operating system rather than the more limited Windows RT that ARM processors are confined to . This means that tablets will be able to run Windows 8 , Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 on Cherry Trail . With the release of Cherry Trail , Intel will be boosting the graphics performance . The company claims that with Atom Cherry Trail , users will have desktop-grade graphics power on mobiles and tablets . This will allow Cherry Trail to handle casual gaming and more graphics intensive tasks better .

Intel 's sixth-generation Skylake processors wo n't be ready in time for Computex 2015 in June and will debut at some point in August with a showcase at the Intel Developer Forum being tipped as the date for the diary . A recently leaked product roadmap shows that the Skylake-U mobile chip and Skylake-S desktop version are both looking at a Q3 2015 unveiling with Broadwell chips picking up the slack in the meantime . VR-Zone also confirmed some of the TDP ratings of the range of desktop Skylake-S chips that is topped by the quad-core K CPU , which has a 95W maximum and is joined by the more energy efficient 65W and 35W variants . Reports midway through last year already mentioned the top-end 95W TDP rating when a leak stated there will be four versions of Skylake with some possessing eDRAM ( up to 128MB ) , support for DDR4 and TDP from 4W up to 95W . Skylake chips are expected to bring increases in battery life and power efficiency for laptops as well as cord cutting features such as support for wireless charging and the ability to send data and display signals over WiGig .

Not so long ago , processors were judged largely by raw clock speed alone , a measure of how many calculations the chip is capable of performing in the space of a second . These days , it 's all about cores , which have allowed chipmakers like Intel to boost speed by splitting tasks across a number of processing units that exist on the same die . Coupled with software designed to take advantage of multiple cores , such processors can wind up tackling intensive work faster than ever before . However , shopping for a new processor is n't quite as simple as picking the one with the fastest processor speed and the most cores , but we 're here to help outline the subtle ( and not-so subtle ) differences before purchasing your next PC . Let 's start with a bit of backstory on what Intel has to offer - but if you 're just curious which processors are the fastest currently available , jump straight to the wrap-up to find out . For the purposes of our discussion , we 'll focus strictly on central processing units ( CPUs ) manufactured by Intel , who is considered the market leader powering the majority of Windows and Mac OS X-based systems available . ( Competitor AMD typically costs less , and is therefore more commonly found on budget-priced Windows boxes . ) Intel also makes processors dedicated to servers and embedded devices , as well as an increasing number of mobile devices . While these CPUs are classified into a number of product families - familiar names like Xeon , Atom and Core - our focus will mostly be on the traditional desktop and notebook CPUs the company is best known for . The most popular Intel processors would be the Core `` i '' series , now in its fifth desktop generation with the current Broadwell code name . A successor to the Core 2 processor introduced in 2006 , the `` i '' series is broken into three categories that could be generally classified as `` good , better and best . '' Despite their names , Core i3 , Core i5 and Core i7 do not signify how many processing cores each has - rather , they are simply designations that classify how many stars Intel would assign to a given chip , based upon expected performance . ( Intel abandoned the previous star rating system in favor of this numeric designation . ) One of the easiest ways to categorize Intel Core processors is to look at how Apple has implemented them into its line of popular notebooks . Core i7 processors are used to power the high-end 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display , while Core i5 processors are used in a variety of speeds for the less expensive 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display , as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch MacBook Air models . Apple does n't currently utilize the lower-end Core i3 processor in its notebook or desktop lineup , but plenty of Windows OEMs certainly do - if you happen to see an advertisement for a system with a price that appears too good to be true , there 's a good chance it may powered by something from the Pentium , Celeron or Core i3 family . Core i7 debuted first in 2008 with a 1.6GHz clock rate at the lower end of the spectrum , ramping up to as fast as 4.4GHz more recently . The i7 category actually breaks down into two camps : Quad-core processors that dissipate a modest amount of power ( 45 to 130 watts ) , and those intended for desktop systems ( between 130 and 150 watts ) which offer a variety of more powerful multi-core options ( more on that in a moment ) . The next rung down the ladder is Core i5 , the popular midrange processor lineup Intel first introduced in 2009 . Core i5 chips are available for desktop and laptop systems in dual-core and quad-core configurations that are surprisingly efficient ( 17 to 95 watts ) . Last but not least , Core i3 is considered the new kid on the motherboard , introduced in 2010 as a cost-effective , dual-core option with initial clock speeds of 2.4GHz that have been increased to 3.7GHz in recent months . While the Core i3 may fall short in raw power , it more than makes up for that in low power dissipation ( between 35 and 73 watts ) , but generally speaking , this series will be found in budget-priced systems . The Core lineup certainly was n't Intel 's first rodeo - far from it ! The company introduced the Pentium line way back in 1993 with a meager clock rate starting at 60MHz ( yes , megahertz ! ) and not a second core in sight until 2005 , when the Pentium D/Extreme Edition ( EE ) served up a dual-core CPU capable of running multi-threaded applications . A year later , the first-generation Intel Core processor would be introduced , eventually paving the way for Intel Core and Core 2 CPUs and the eventual leap to the current Core i3/i5/i7 lineup . Along the way , Intel introduced a dizzying variety of Pentium-class chips , including the MMX ( 1996-1999 ) , Pentium Pro ( 1995-1998 ) , Pentium II ( 1997-1999 ) , Pentium III ( 1999-2003 ) , Pentium 4 ( 2000-2008 ) and the Pentium M ( 2005-2008 ) . Remarkably , the Pentium 20th Anniversary Edition was released in 2014 to celebrate this venerable granddad of PC processors , which continues to hold a strategic position at the lower end of the Intel lineup .

Intel has introduced seven new processors that will make their way into affordable laptops and desktops . The new chips , from the Braswell family , are manufactured using a 14nm technology and will take over Bay Trail parts in the long term . Interestingly , all the announced Celeron parts cost the same except the N3150 ( the top range model ) and come with four cores clocked at 1.6GHz with 2MB of cache . Braswell ( for desktops ) and Cherry Trail ( for tablets ) are both part of Airmont , which is a die-shrink of the current Silvermont architecture . The popular Geekbench 3 application suite shows that the N3150 scored 843 and 2689 respectively on its single-core and multi-core benchmarks , both very decent numbers . The newcomers are likely to find their way into Intel 's next generation NUCs ( Next Unit of Computing ) , in addition to entry-level desktops and laptops . Braswell was announced last year in China as part of a concerted push by Intel to produce Chromebooks and similar devices costing as little as $ 199 ( about £120 , AU $ 240 ) . That said , if Intel wants to hit that price point , it will have to significantly reduce the suggested retail prices of the newly-released processors which hover around the $ 100 ( about $ 60 , AU $ 120 ) mark .

Semiconductor giant Intel is said to be in talks with Altera , a specialist in the FPGA ( field-programmable gate array ) market for a potential outright buyout worth more than $ 10 billion ( about £6.8 billion , AU $ 13 billion ) . That would dwarf its previous big acquisition , that of security firm McAfee back in 2010 . Wall Street appeared to be pleased by the prospect of this transaction , sending Intel 's shares up by 6 % at one point . Intel 's hegemony on microprocessors is currently being challenged by ARM in the embedded and mobile markets . However , Altera is likely to be used at the opposite end of the CPU spectrum , within the entrails of data centres . Intel used it already in a range of semi-customised Xeon processors that have been employed widely across a range of selected customers . So what 's the deal with FPGA technology then ? It essentially allows hardware manufacturers ( Oracle , Huawei , Cisco ) and hyperscale customers ( Baidu , Amazon , Microsoft ) to fine-tune/tweak/hack the processor to fit their workload . It can be done very quickly and most importantly , without human intervention . It 's essentially a middle-ground between ARM 's laissez-faire and Intel 's regimented approach to who controls the CPU . Speaking of ARM , Altera , like Intel , is a licensee of the Cambridge-based fabless company .

Using floating gate cells , Intel and Micron announced manufacturing has started on its 3D NAND flash storage and should be in products within next year , a move that could make 10TB solid state drives a reality . Like how city skyscrapers help accommodate more capacity by building upwards compared to flat , single family homes , Intel says that 3D NAND technology allows cells to be stacked vertically to allow more storage on the same footprint . Both companies claim that their 3D technology , based on floating gate cells , delivers up to three times the capacity of existing 3D NAND storage technology . Intel says that 75 % of a terabyte can fit in a fingertip-sized package . `` The new 3D NAND technology stacks flash cells vertically in 32 layers to achieve 256Gb multilevel cell ( MLC ) and 384Gb triple-level cell ( TLC ) die that fit within a standard package , '' Brian Shirley , Micron Technology VP of Memory and Storage Solutions , said . `` These capacities can enable gum stick-sized SSDs with more than 3.5TB of storage and standard 2.5-inch SSDs with greater than 10TB . '' In addition to increasing storage capacity , a benefit of vertically stacking cells together is that this will increase endurance and performance of the chips as the individual cell dimensions can be larger . Micron claimed that the move to 3D technology will help `` enable Moore 's Law for many , many generations to come '' as `` we 're reaching a path of diminishing return '' on planar flash . Bill Leszinske , General Manager for Business Development and Strategy at Intel 's New Devices Group , said that the company designed 3D NAND to be cheaper than 2D NAND , and that the `` first-generation 3D NAND is architected to achieve better cost efficiencies than planar NAND . '' Micron has already begun sampling of its 3D NAND to select partners . Pricing for the new chips was not announced .

The mobile processor arms race is back on as both Intel and AMD have unveiled smaller processors at the of start 2015 . Intel kicked things off by introducing 14nm Broadwell , a miniaturization of the company 's already efficient 24nm Haswell architecture , at CES 2015 . Not to be forgotten , AMD announced its 28nm Carrizo architecture on February 21 , claiming it found a way to squeeze 29 % more transistors into the same space as its older processors . Although it might seem like Intel has the leg up on AMD with a smaller manufacturing process , both companies have essentially created a shrunken CPU core . There are big benefits to be had from going smaller as these components draw less power and invariably produce less heat . This potentially paves the way for thinner and longer-lasting laptops , similar to what Intel 's Core M chip has done for fanless laptops like the Asus ZenBook UX305 . So without further ado let 's dive into two chipmakers are tackling smaller processors and the benefits you can expect this CPU generation . When we say CPUs are shrinking , the chip itself is n't the only thing getting smaller . Invisible to the naked eye , the underlying transistors that make up the processors ' brains became even tinnier . Intel 's Mobile Marketing Manager Karen Regis said that with Broadwell , the company found a way to mince its 22nm Haswell transistors into even finer 14nm bits . Despite making the processor die smaller , Intel was able to fit more transistors . This was thanks to reducing the size of everything else on the CPU , from the transistor pins to the gates to the interconnecting material holding the part together in 13-layers . In doing so , Intel claimed it was able to increase Broadwell 's power efficiency by 30 % . The new CPUs use less energy thanks to being inherently smaller and having better built-in power management for a laptop 's other components . `` We can help to reduce the power consumption across other components in the platform like , say , memory , '' Regis said of the benefits of Broadwell 's improved power management . In our own benchmark testing we found an Intel Core i5 Broadwell-powered Dell XPS 13 was able to perform on equal footing with last year 's model , which came sporting a higher-end Core i7 processor . Battery life also saw a considerable bump from 3 hours and 47 minutes to 4 hours and 21 minutes . While that 's closer to a 15 % increase in battery life , users upgrading to new Broadwell-powered machines should see a net increase in battery life from Haswell-powered machines.. Even smaller and lower-wattage CPUs like Intel 's Core M processor have enabled manufacturers to come out with thinner , lighter and longer-lasting laptops . The Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro and Asus ZenBook UX305 are two such laptops that offer users the full Windows 8.1 experience on a machine that lasts just over five hours . Energy efficiency is n't the only trick Broadwell has up its sleeve . With its latest mobile processor refresh , Intel also improved the on-board integrated graphics . Broadwell features a shrunken GPU die , which allowed Intel to attach more graphics execution units responsible for driving the visuals on the laptop to deliver better performance . Additionally , the processor maker increased the peak frequency on its graphics engine . All in all these improvements should allow even small form-factor devices without the space for a discrete graphics to perform exceptionally well with graphics-intensive applications and games .

`` Things tend to happen in cycles '' , Jennifer Healey , research scientist at Intel , remarked at the beginning of our interview . Thin clients attached to mainframes became fat clients , who tend became hooked to the cloud to become thin again ( think Chromebook ) and while sensors are `` thin '' for now , their realm - commonly known as the edge - is likely to become more powerful . And it could n't happen sooner according to Healey . The Internet of Things gives the end user insights into things . Yes it does get rid of serendipity but it 's always optional . The combination of access to data and predictive intelligence is a boon for businesses and humans are very much actively involved in the process , either as receivers or designers . `` The Internet of Things is all about offering '' , Healey quipped . `` But more intelligence is needed at the edge , '' she quickly added . Like in a human organisation , the rise of employees often means adding layers between the boss and the army of lower-ranked staff . The same is likely to happen for the edge where the middle manager would essentially sift through data sent by the sensors and decide whether stuff would need to be sent back to the cloud ( or clouds ) . Simplifying big data also helps to mitigate the looming storage shortage crisis that a Seagate VP mentioned last year . The majority of data can be kept off the big cloud and locally distributed while being accessible to the big cloud when needed . `` The cloud and the edge need to work closer , '' she said , before noting that there is a general tendency to oversimplify the edge . Bringing the compute closer to the sensors means that there is no need to constantly send data to the cloud . That reduces or eliminates latency and introduced nuanced decision making at the edge about whether to send some details or not to the cloud . That in turn will increase the complexity of solutions at the edge . That dovetails nicely with the messaging Intel had when it launched the Xeon D a few days ago . `` Extending intelligence to the edge '' via edge routers , wireless base station , network and security appliances as well as entry level SAN and NAS is on Intel 's roadmap . In the industrial segment where , Healey , a former Windriver alumni , hails from , that 's taken care by the `` Moon Island '' family , powered by the Quark X1020D . As for the massive rise in data being processed at the edge , she reckons that it will make users become … . edgy . `` People will become more picky and strategic about what they send to the cloud '' , Healey noted . Interestingly , the same point was raised by Ian Drew , the CMO and VP Business Development at rival ARM during his keynote at CeBIT later that same afternoon . Drew used the recent announcement of a cloud-connected Barbie launched by Mattel to highlight the responsibilities shared by cloud service providers when it came to privacy and security .

Intel has pulled the curtains on the latest additions to its server-focused Xeon family with immediate availability . The Xeon Processor D fills a gap between the low-end Atom-based C2750 and the mainstream Xeon E5 range and looks destined to reinforce Intel 's formidable armada as competition from ARM ( via Cavium , Calxeda , Applied Micro and AMD ) heats up . With the Xeon D , Intel moves the focus from the Data Center edge to the Network edge , a clear threat to ARM 's established partners like Freescale , Broadcom or Marvell . Amongst the target products are edge routers , microservers wireless base stations , network and security appliances as well as entry-level NAS and SANs . And Intel is coming out with all guns blazing with more than 50 design wins expected on the Xeon Processor D range , including the likes of Cisco , NEC , HP , QCT , Sugon and Supermicro . The Xeon D range consists of two models , the 1520 and the 1540 , both of which have a 45W TDP and are system-on-chip solutions . They 're based on the Broadwell architecture ( Haswell shrink and 14nm manufacturing process ) . Intel says that the more powerful of the two , the 1540 , has eight cores , with 16 threads and is clocked at 2GHz . The company quotes a performance improvement of up to 3.4x compared to the C2750 and 1.7x better performance per watt ( although the figure is likely to be higher as the tests were carried out on a pre-production Xeon Processor D clocked at 1.9GHz ) . What is likely to make vendors and businesses more excited , beyond the performance , is that it integrates connectivity and other IOs . There 's support for two 10GbE Ethernet , 24x PCIe 3 , 8x PCIe 2 , six SATA3 and four USB 3.0 ports . Others will like the fact that it supports up to 12MB of L3 cache and can address up to 128GB of DDR4 memory . The Xeon Processor D is already available to select partners . Price starts from $ 199 ( about £130 , AU $ 230 ) for the D-1520 .

Intel is upping the ante for PC gamers everywhere by bringing its powerful Iris Pro processor to desktop machines . The fifth-generation LGA-socketed Core processor with Iris Pro integrated graphics was announced at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and it marks a 100-fold upsurge in graphics compared to where the company stood in 2006 . Intel originally announced the integrated Iris graphics line alongside new Broadwell chips in January and an improved version of that , the 65W socketed Iris Pro 6100 , will be inside desktops shipping in the middle of 2015 . Gamers will also get a new level of optimisation on their Intel-based PCs thanks to a partnership with Raptr that automatically provides optimised settings that can be changed with the touch of a button by using the utility . Raptr creates a list of settings for each game using information from Intel , later combining it with machine learning and metrics from client machines running Raptr to provide the best group of settings possible for each title .

Intel has announced plans to split its Atom range of CPUs into three distinct tiers aimed at different audiences . The move , which mirrors what the company did to its mainstream core processor family , aims to simplify a product line that is becoming increasingly more complicated as more stock keeping units are added . The new system-on-chips ( SoCs ) are called Atom x3 , Atom x5 and Atom x7 . Atom has been a big priority for Intel in its attempts to wrestle the mobile market away from ARM and its partners . There are three X3 processors , two X5 and one X7 CPU . The X3 CPUs , which are rebranded SoFIA chips , are all Bay-trail based models with 3G or LTE connectivity baked in while the X5 and X7 are based on the 14nm Cherry Trail platform . Interestingly , Intel went for an ARM Mali solution and a mature 28nm manufacturing process for the X3 range , possibly to slash the time to market and to reduce costs . Pricier parts will get Broadwell-class GPUs , albeit with reduced capabilities . Products based on the X5 and X7 will be launched in the first half of the year and will receive Intel 's new LTE modem , the XMM7360 capable of up to 450Mbps download speeds .

Update : Intel 's Compute Stick is now available for preorder in the UK from Dabs for £129.98 ( about $ 200 , AU $ 250 ) . Note that only the Windows version is available for now . Devices like Google 's Chromecast and Amazon 's Fire TV brought instant media streaming to the living room , and now Intel is looking to go one further with a stick that transforms any HDMI-equipped TV into a fully-fledged PC . Unveiled at CES 2015 , Intel 's Compute Stick is a four-inch device that 's powered by a quad-core Intel Atom Bay Trail Z3735F CPU and runs Windows 8.1 or Linux . Features include built-in Wi-Fi and a microSD slot to boost storage . The Windows version comes with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage for $ 149 ( around £98/AUS $ 184 ) , while the Linux option offers 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage for $ 89 ( around £57/AUS $ 110 ) . Newegg has the Intel Compute Stick available for pre-order currently . The Windows version sells for $ 149 ( around £98/AUS $ 184 ) , while the Linux option retails for $ 110 ( £74 , AU $ 145 ) , slightly higher than the announced $ 89 ( £57 , AU $ 110 ) price that was announced originally at CES . The retailer is listing both versions as not in stock currently with a release date of April 24 and an estimated arrival date of May 1 . Like the Chromecast , the Compute Stick uses a micro-USB port for power , meaning it may be possible to power it using one of your TV 's spare USB ports rather than a mains socket . In addition to web surfing and other common activities , Intel reckons the Compute Stick 's energy efficient nature makes it suitable for on-the-move developers or business users who require remote IT support in the field . While not the cheapest way of carrying a full Windows 8.1 PC in your pocket ( a Linx 7 Windows 8.1 tablet with HDMI-out can be had for £79 ) , the Intel Compute stick will no doubt appeal to those looking for the most portable way to lug around Windows 8.1 or Linux when it lands in March .

Another day , another couple of leaks that reveal a little more about what Intel has planned for its Broadwell and Skylake families this year . Kicking things off with Broadwell , a slide reported by WCCF Tech almost certainly confirms that the desktop incarnation of the popular chip will gets its first outing at Computex 2015 in June . The slide goes on to say that the fifth-generation Intel Core processor will be the first LGA-socketed CPU to have Intel Iris Pro graphics , will take the form of a 65W TDP unlocked version , and have embedded DRAM as part of the package Intel 's Skylake range , meanwhile , is ready to include a pair of `` enthusiast-class '' CPUs later this year that will bring a new level of power and efficiency to the range , according to Kit Guru . The range of quad-core processors kicks off with the Core i5-6600K chip clocked at 3.50GHz that can be turbo-boosted to 3.90GHz and is complemented by 6MB last-level cache , a dual-channel DDR3/DDR4 memory controller with 1600MHz or 2133MHz support . It also offers a 95W TDP , LGA1151 packaging and integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000 . Alongside this the Core i7-6700K shares the same features except but is clocked at 4.0GHz frequency ( 4.20GHz Turbo Boost ) and a 8MB last-level cache . Both Broadwell and Skylake are built using a 14nm process and further details on both products will likely be unveiled at Computex 2015 in June .

Intel will release a downgraded itineration of its Itanium product line later this year thanks to there being just enough demand for the IA64 chips First reported by Kitguru , an Intel spokesperson stated that `` Kittson '' will become the first new version of the chipset since 2012 and bring a 32nm process technology that is a downgrade from the original 22nm plan . `` Intel remains committed to the Intel Itanium product line and to the delivery of the next-generation Intel Itanium processor , code named 'Kittson ' , '' said Anna Cheng , a spokeswoman for Intel . `` Kittson will be manufactured on Intel 's 32nm process technology and will be socket compatible with the existing Itanium 9300/9500 platforms , providing customers with performance improvements , investment protection , and a seamless upgrade path for existing systems . '' Intel has been relentlessly focusing on its Xeon chips to the detriment of the IA64 chips that are way behind x86-64 chips . That attitude saw multiple partners move away from the Itanium 9500 `` Poulson '' chip , which was the last new release , and over to Xeon chips . HP is one of the only big players to still use the Itanium chips and it makes the post-Kittson future of Itanium a precarious one . `` Intel , HP and our other OEM partners remain in discussion about the timing and feature set of Kittson , '' added Ms. Cheng . `` We have not disclosed any product plans after Kittson . '' With HP also working towards moving to the X86-64 ecosystem there will might soon be no call for the Itanium chips and all eyes will be on Intel 's next announcement regarding the future of the family .

Panasonic is giving its Toughpad 4K tablet a refresh with the addition of Intel 's 5th Generation Broadwell processor . The Toughpad 4K was first introduced in 2013 as the world 's first rugged 20-inch tablet with a high resolution 4K display . Panasonic is targeting video professionals with the latest refresh by adding an HDMI 2.0 input that will allow users to view content from other sources on the tablet . `` The new HDMI 2.0 input , alongside other connectivity options such as USB 3.0 , Intel Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac , Bluetooth 4.0 ( class 1 ) , Ethernet and Mini DisplayPort output , allow professionals to connect a greater range of peripherals and tools directly to the tablet for more efficient workflows , '' Panasonic said in a statement . In spite of the enhancements , the Intel Core i5-powered Toughpad 4K will launch in July at $ 2,999 ( £2,050 , AU $ 3,955 ) , or half of the $ 5,999 ( £4,090 , AU $ 7,910 ) cost of the first generation model . Panasonic has not revealed what battery life improvements Broadwell brings to the Toughpad 4K , but the stated battery life on the first generation model is rated at two hours . Intel claims that Broadwell chips provide 30 % more efficiency than prior generation processors , so users should expect to squeeze additional battery life out of the new Toughpad 4K . In our early hands-on with the first generation model , a downside with the 4K display is that icons appear tiny given the high resolution screen . Using the touchscreen became problematic because of this , as it means users had to tap on small icons . Hopefully , Panasonic addressed the screen scaling issue on the new generation . Although the Toughpad 4K has a large 20-inch IPS Alpha LCD display , the rugged tablet can handle tumbles . The magnesium alloy frame and reinforced glass fiber case construction mean that the Toughpad 4K can survive 30-inch drops on its back while powered on . With the device turned off , Panasonic says that the Toughpad can survive 12-inch drops to 26 angles . Video professionals who take the Toughpad 4K into the field for use as a display wo n't have to worry too much about accidental drops . For those who prefer to use the Toughpad 4K at a desk , there will be an optional desktop cradle to convert the tablet into an all-in-one ( AIO ) . The result would be similar to Dell 's consumer-grade XPS 18 with FHD display and Lenovo Horizon 2s . The Toughpad 4K also has a VESA-compatible mounting adapter .

Intel has promised to deliver the world 's most powerful supercomputer system to the US Department of Energy 's Argonne Leadership Computing Facility ( ALCF ) . The contract , which is part of a the DOE 's multi-million dollar plan to build supercomputers , involves two separate machines that will help the US energy sector to advance its position at the forefront of next-generation exascale computing . The star of the show is the `` Aurora '' high performance computing ( HPC ) system that has a peak performance of 180 petaflops and is 18 times more powerful than its predecessor `` Mira , '' while only using 2.7 times the energy . The DOE will use the system to advance a range of research goals including battery and solar panel development , improved transportation systems , new plans for the placement and design of wind turbines , and various other initiatives . Aurora is based on Intel 's scalable system framework that combines Intel HPC building blocks , future Intel Xeon Phi chips and Omni-Path Fabric high-speed interconnect technology . The plan is for the ALCF to take delivery of Aurora in 2018 . Its smaller sibling , `` Theta , '' offers performance of 8.5 petaflops using just 1.7 megawatts of power . The HPC will work as an early production system for the ALCF and be delivered in 2016 . Power will come from Intel Xeon and next-gen Intel Xeon Phi processors , and it is based on the latest Cray XC supercomputer . Intel 's $ 200 million contract is part of a wider initiative by the US DOE to develop state of the art computers at its Argonne , Lawrence Livermore and Oak Ridge National Laboratories . To that end it has already signed a $ 325 million contract with Nvidia and IBM to provide two GPU-accelerated supercomputers by 2017 .

More details on Intel 's next generation Skylake processors have seeped out at the Intel Developer Forum in Shenzhen , China . First reported by Hexus , Intel used a conference session to show off the graphical capabilities on a range of machines , explaining certain versions of the Skylake processor will be capable of handling super sharp Intel Iris 6100 graphics . The Skylake processors capable of handling Iris 6100 have a TDP ( thermal design power ) of just 15W , and Intel will release four such Core i5 and i7 processors before 2015 is out . The firm will then follow this up with four more SKUs , offering the same support in 2016 . Integrated Iris Graphics 6100 were first introduced into Broadwell processors earlier this year and Intel has only rolled it out to four different chips that all have a 28W TDP , except the Core i7-5557U that can bring this rating down to 23W . Broadwell – a refinement or shrinking of Haswell 's design , also known as a `` tick '' – and Skylake – a brand new design , or Intel 's `` tock '' – are both built using a 14nm process . Plus , the fact that an Iris 6100 can be implemented inside a chip with a TDP as low as 15W shows the confidence Intel has in Skylake 's power consumption . When Intel 's Skylake chips eventually get their full release later this year they will bring to laptops the obvious huge uplifts in both battery life and power efficiency , and will target both the high `` Extreme '' end of the market and low-end machines .
In an efforts to not be left behind in the fast-moving Internet of Things ( IoT ) sector , Intel has introduced a new universal firmware engine that helps developers get hardware using Atom or Quark chips off the ground quicker . The new Firmware Engine , which was unveiled at IDF 2015 in Shenzhen , China , takes the form of a GUI that lets developers build custom firmware images for Intel-powered devices without needing to fiddle around with the source code . Developers start off with an Intel-approved firmware image where they can then add or remove features to fit their needs . There is even the opportunity to add third party components and integrate custom boot payloads . The images produced at the end of the process are based on Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) specifications and can be booted on compatible operating systems such as Windows , Android and Linux . For any developers in the hankering for a little bit more , they can extend the firmware 's usefulness by using the Firmware Engine SDK . The firmware itself supports reference boards based on Atom chips as well as the specialised Quark chips that are geared towards IoT devices . The first boards to be supported are the Intel Galileo Gen 2 and MinnowBoard , according to The Register . Intel unveiled an IoT platform in December 2014 that combines software and hardware and is designed to allow its partners bring complete IoT systems to market that already take security and management capabilities into account . Alongside this there is a solution from Intel-owned McAfee called Enhanced Security for IoT Gateways based on the platform and it 's hoped this will assuage fears of IoT security becoming a problem .
Intel Security has buddied up with the FBI and Europol to bring down a notorious botnet with a sting in its tail . The polymorphic Beebone botnet , which at its peak in 2014 infected over 100,000 machines in 195 countries , was taken down using tools developed by Intel alongside the FBI , Europol 's European Cybercrime Centre , Dutch authorities and various private sector agencies . `` Intel Security is aware of more than five million unique AAEH samples with more than 100,000 machines from 200 countries identified . This kind of takedown could not of happened without the cooperation between police organisations and private companies , '' said Raj Samani , EMEA CTO at Intel Security . Intel Security first identified the threat way back in March 2014 and it was only in September 2014 , when it had collected sufficient data , that it approached the international cybercrime fighting community for help . Beebone was dangerous because it allowed other malware to be downloaded to target machines that could include everything from banking password stealers and rootkits to fake antivirus software and ransomware . It had a worm-like ability to infiltrate new machines by spreading across networks , removable drives and inside infected ZIP and RAR archive files . The prevention action carried out by Intel and its partners saw the complete eradication of the threat and the takedown of some 100 domains in the process . Microsoft worked with the FBI in a similar way back in June 2014 when it leant its botnet fighting expertise to get rid of the GameOver Zeus Trojan that was targeting passwords and also tried to pilfer online banking details .

Intel has agreed a deal with eASIC to develop a new breed of customised Xeon chip designed for specific workloads like security and big data that can cut the time-to-market for chips in half . The collaboration is part of Intel 's plan to get reprogrammable technology inside its Xeon processors and bring a greater level of performance and power at a more competitive price level . In order to bring that new level of customisation to its chips , eASIC will integrate its renowned platform technology with future Intel Xeon chips to bring a highly customised and integrated hardware solution to cloud service providers . The new technology will reportedly enable acceleration of up to two times that of a field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) for workloads like security and big data analytics , and accelerate the time-to-market for custom application specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) development by up to 50 % . Intel hand-picked eASIC to provide the technology because it can increase flexibility and fast-time-to-market compared to traditional ASICs as well as increased performance and lower power consumption when up against FPGAs . `` Having the ability to highly customise our solutions for a given workload will not only make the specific application run faster , but also help accelerate the growth of exciting new applications like visual search , '' said Diane Bryant , senior vice president and general manager of Intel 's Data Centre Group . Neither firm clarified the Xeon chips that will be getting the eASIC treatment beyond stating that it will be `` future Intel Xeon processors '' .

Intel 's Compute Stick attracted its fair share of criticism when it launched because of its underpowered ( but crazily affordable ) Bay Trail-based Atom processor , the Z3735 . Now , a spokesperson for the semiconductor company has confirmed that future iterations may well include Core M processors , similar to what powered the Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro . That helps explain why the Compute Stick had a fan stuck in despite the fact that other similar products ( tablets , dongles or computers ) used a passive heat dissipating setup . The Core M dissipates about twice the amount of heat of its Atom counterpart . A Core M processor will certainly improve the device 's compute and graphics performance . Intel will , however , almost certainly need to cut prices as it is an expensive part , costing more than twice the current Compute Stick on its own ( and roughly 17x the price of the Atom Z3735 that powers it ) . Source : Notebook Italia
Intel has refreshed its top of the range Xeon processors with the new Xeon E7 v3 models , based on the Haswell microarchitecture , a product line that will target analytics , business intelligence , ERP , OLTP and so-called big iron tasks . The new family comprises of 12 SKUs with up to 18 cores and 45MB of L2 cache on the biggest ( and most expensive ) model , the E7-8890 , which is clocked at 2.5GHz . Intel is still using a 22nm process , which explains why that particular chip has a rather toasty TDP of 165W ( in all fairness , some of the increase might be due to the integration of the voltage regulator ) . The next iteration of that chip , codenamed Broadwell-EX , will be etched using a 14nm process , which is likely to cut power consumption . Other notable features include DDR4 support , up to 1.5TB of RAM in 8-socket mode , up to 32-socket per configuration and the ability to mix and match different SKUs in the same system . The new platform is expected to deliver up to 10x performance improvement per dollar compared to the ( mostly RISC-based ) competition , at about one-eighth of the total cost of ownership spread over four years . Even compared to the previous Ivy Bridge-based models , Intel claims up to 600 % improvements on some enteprise applications although that is down mostly to software optimisation .

Pricing for Intel 's new range of entry level NUC ( next unit of computing ) have emerged in the US and in the UK . The NUC5CPYH and the NUC5PPYH both run Braswell CPUs , which are built using the same advanced 14nm technology as their more expensive siblings that often power Ultrabooks . The first model runs a dual-core Celeron N3050 CPU at 1.6GHz while the other model is powered by a quad-core Pentium N3700 CPU clocked at 1.6GHz . Both models support USB 3.0 ( they have four of them ) , DDR3L-1600 ( up to 8GB ) , HDMI 1.4a which supports 4K , GbE port , a SD card slot , an infrared sensor , support for a 2.5-inch drive , a TOSLINK jack , 802.11ac , Bluetooth 4.0 and a three-year warranty . Surprisingly , Intel chose to include a VGA port rather than a DisplayPort . That 's because a lot of displays out there ( including a fair few projectors ) still sport that legacy connector . Amazon listed the cheaper model for $ 129 ( about £80 , AU $ 160 ) but it now shows as being unavailable . In the UK , one little known shop listed the Celeron-based NUC for £105 ( about $ 150 , AU $ 200 ) and the Pentium-based one for £150 ( about $ 225 , AU $ 300 ) . Another affordable compute solution from Intel is the Compute Stick which comes with storage and an OS but does n't offer either the performance or the expansion capabilities of the NUCs .

If you own Intel 's mini NUC PC or Compute Stick and find yourself in need of a keyboard and touchpad to interact with your diminutive Windows computer , Intel has a solution . In an odd marriage between Windows and Android , the Intel software , available in the Google Play Store , allows Android users to use their phone 's touchscreen as a keyboard or touchpad for their PC . You will need a Windows 8.1 PC , and pairing your phone to your computer is as easy as scanning a QR code once the free Intel Remote Keyboard app is downloaded to an Android smartphone or tablet . The best part is that the software brings gestures to the computing experience . For example , when in mouse mode , users can perform a left click with one finger , a right click with two fingers and a finger slide across the touchscreen to emulate a scrolling motion . The Intel Compute Stick is about the same size of Google 's Chromecast . Essentially the size of an HDMI dongle , the Compute Stick plugs into the HDMI port on a monitor , projector or HDTV and brings the full Windows experience to a form factor that 's much smaller than a mini PC or traditional desktop . The downside is that if you plug the Compute Stick into your living room TV , for example , you may not always have a keyboard and mouse or trackpad nearby when you need to do computing tasks . The Intel Remote Keyboard Android app makes it easy as most users will always have their phones nearby . Intel 's Compute Stick costs $ 170 ( £107 , AU $ 218 ) . In addition to Intel , other manufacturers , including Foxconn and Lenovo , are exploring smaller PC form factors .

Intel has introduced 10 new desktop processors at the Computex event in Taiwan ; most of them come with the Iris Pro Graphics 6200 , the first time that the GPU is brought to the desktop market . All the parts , Core i7 and Core i5 Broadwell-H models , are manufactured using Intel 's 14nm process technology and have a TDP ranging from 47W to 65W with dual and quad-core models . A couple of them are unlocked which means that users will be able to overclock them . Intel also claims that graphics performance will be double that of previous CPUs which used HD Graphics 4600 . The semiconductor company has also added more powerful graphics subsystem to a Xeon E3 CPU . The E3-1200 v4 gets Iris Pro graphics P6300 GPU to deliver what Intel calls its most powerful data centre graphics . A server rack running these Xeons should be able to deliver more than 4300 HD video streams simultaneously , a 40 % improvement on the previous generation . The current generation is viewed as a stop gap ahead of the launch of Skylake , the company 's 6th generation architecture , later this year . Paradoxically , we 've witnessed a number of products being launched at Computex with Skylake processors ( or so it seems ) .
Intel has confirmed that it will be using the USB Type-C connector for the Thunderbolt 3 , its next generation data communication standard , a move that brings both technologies closer . The move comes after Apple introduced the first mainstream device to run USB Type-C , the 12-inch MacBook , which controversially only has one port . Intel says that the new connection will deliver up to 40Gbps , twice the speed of the current Thunderbolt and four times the maximum theoretical speed of USB 3.1 ( and DisplayPort 1.2 ) . USB Type-C will allow users to run two 4K displays concurrently at 60Hz while providing up to 100W in power and 15W per device over distances of up to 60m ( when using active optical cables that are expected to launch in 2016 ) . Thunderbolt over USB-C will also support more protocols including PCIexpress - and you will still be able to daisy-chain up to six devices . The new technology paves the way for a single-cable docking with charging as well as Thunderbolt-based networking and external graphics cards . Products , based on the Alpine Ridge controller , are likely to be available later this year just in time for the launch of Skylake , Intel 's next generation architecture .

Asus has unveiled four devices that run on an unannounced , not yet launched 6th generation Intel Core I-series Skylake processor , which comes after Broadwell . The first two are gaming workstations while the third is a mini PC , the VC65 , which brings some exciting features like onboard RAID ( which means it has space for two drives ) and , from what we could gather on pictures , even a serial port . Its design is reminiscent of the Dell GX620 Ultra Small Form Factor from 10 years ago but with smoother curves and a VESA mount . Unlike many of its competitors , the PSU is built in , which has its advantages - such as reducing clutter but making it compulsory to send the part back if there 's any power-related issues . The rest of the configuration is pretty enticing ; you can connect at least four displays to it ( one USB 3.0 , one Display Port , one HDMI and one VGA ) , plus there 's an Ethernet port , six USB 3.0 connectors and two audio ports . The fourth device to feature a Skylake , 6th generation Intel Core CPU is the VivoMini UH65H , which is Asus 's take on Intel 's NUC ( next unit of computing ) . This one comes with an Iris Pro GPU and supports an M2 SSD and a 2.5-inch hard disk drive . There 's also 802.11ac dual-band Wi-Fi and from what we could see from some blurry shots , four USB 3.0 ports , an Ethernet port , Display Port and HDMI as well as a SD card reader . Unlike the VC65 , the PSU is likely to be outside .

Intel announced that it was teaming up with Micron , another US semiconductor company , to release what could be considered to be a game changing technology , a non-volatile memory technology called 3D Xpoint , the first paradigm shift in memory/storage since the introduction of NAND 25 years ago . Shares in both companies went up shortly after the announcement ( Micron by a whopping 10 % and Intel by a more conservative 2 % ) and brought up a potentially fascinating scenario . We know that at least one company , Chinese behemoth Tsinghua Unigroup , has approached Micron with a potential bid of $ 23 billion ( about £15 billion , AU $ 31 billion ) , but given how sensitive the technology Micron is handling is , the US government is unlikely to greenlight the transaction . Micron 's eagerness to explore a potential buyout comes after the company issued a profit warning earlier this month following a softer-than-expected quarter . It could also attract interest from Intel as it seeks to extend its zone of dominance beyond compute . It showed its financial clout earlier this year when it acquired FPGA maker Altera for nearly $ 17 billion ( about £11 billion , AU $ 23 billion ) . Micron is more expensive , currently standing at just under $ 20 billion ( about £13 billion , AU $ 27 billion ) , but could fill in a gap that would make of Intel the only end-to-end supplier of compute , storage and network on the market . That 's not unlike Apple which control a lot of its own software and hardware but still has to rely on Intel and Samsung for a lot of its components . The two companies have been collaborating on a number of innovative technologies over the last decade or so and the new memory technology , the first to be launched in more than 25 years , only serve to exemplify the complementary nature of both companies . Should Intel acquire Micron , the Santa Clara company would not only inherit an impressive portfolio of patents but also prevent other potential competitors from owning a whole portfolio of promising technologies . Other than 3D Xpoint , Micron has been working on Automata , a highly parallelized compute engine , Phase Change Memory , 3D NAND , I/O virtualisation and PCIe sharing . Its bread-and-butter products remain DRAM-based , which coincidentally is what Intel needs to become self-sufficient and in a position to provide with entire , self-contained solutions for several key markets ( mobile , PC , servers , embedded ) . Only Samsung , with the possible acquisition of AMD could potential rival an Intel/Micron tie-up . Acquiring Micron would also allow Intel to accelerate the pace towards a unified architecture that blends compute and memory resources in a seamless way , a goal shared with AMD and to a lesser extent by the HSA consortium . More importantly though it would allow it to increase its profit margins at a time where other Intel business units are feeling the price pressure from ARM-based competitors and Samsung . Micron remains the missing piece of the puzzle for Intel ; the question remains whether someone else will swoop in and trash its party .

Leaked Intel presentation slides show what is believed to be Skylake 's improvements over the company 's current Fifth Generation Broadwell processors . The new Skylake chips , expected later this year , will deliver faster processor compute performance , better graphics and longer battery life . Skylake will be Intel 's Sixth Generation processor architecture . Intel will have three different mobile chips – Y-Series , U-Series and H-Series – as well as the desktop-class S-Series for this generation . The leaked slides show that Skylake brings at least an 11 % processor improvement across the board , and graphics performance will increase between 16 % and 41 % compared to Broadwell 's integrated Intel HD Graphics . Not only will mobile workers be able to get better computing performance , you 'll also be able to work longer on a single laptop or tablet charge . Skylake is anticipated to deliver a 30 % increase in battery life , and Intel is claiming 1.4 hours longer battery life in its Y- and U-Series processors . Intel 's current U-Series processors are used in many mainstream Ultrabooks . The current U-Series Broadwell-based Intel Core i3 , i5 and i7 processors are the CPUs found in systems like the Dell XPS 13 , Acer Aspire S7 and Asus ZenBook UX301 . Broadwell 's biggest improvement over the prior Fourth Generation Haswell chip is better battery life . The H-Series family deliver more power than the U-Series , and the chipset is expected to arrive in the next Apple MacBook Pro , which comes with Intel 's improved Iris graphics . The Y-Series processors use a fanless design , and are optimized for tablets . This could give a boost to the two-in-one convertible market , and current fanless notebooks can also benefit from the performance gains . Fanless notebooks on the market today include the Intel Core M-powered HP EliteBook Folio 1020 G1 , Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro , Asus Transformer Book T300 Chi and the Apple MacBook . According to Windows Central , Skylake is anticipated to arrive in Microsoft 's Surface Pro 4 , with the site claiming that the next-generation flagship tablet could arrive in October . Skylake is also expected to launch in this timeframe , and Intel previously confirmed that the chip will arrive in the second half of this year . We previously reported that Skylake could arrive as early as August , which is the time that Intel will host its IDF developer conference . Additionally , new memory improvements could lead to a 50 % increase in 3D gaming performance compared to Broadwell , so it means you 'll also be able to get a better gaming experience on your downtime . Even though the performance claims look promising , a lot could still change between now and when Skylake officially launches . These slides are taken from third-party site Fanless Tech , so the information should be taken with caution as the information has n't been confirmed by Intel . Skylake was shown off in a few mini PC systems from Asus earlier this summer at Computex . Skylake will also come with improved camera support . The leaked slides indicate that Skylake will support a 4K camera , four full-HD cameras or Intel 's RealSense 3D camera . Native support for RealSense 3D could mean that we 'll see more devices supporting Windows Hello 's biometric security . In addition to using a fingerprint , Windows Hello 's facial scanning and recognition feature requires Intel 's camera , which is harder to trick than a traditional webcam . Consumers can use face recognition to log into Windows 10 in lieu of a password or PIN .

Windows 10 's launch could be marred by a bug that can reportedly reduce the time some machines stay alive by just shy of 10 % . First reported by PC World , Intel confirmed that it 's working hard with Microsoft to repair the bug that has the potential to blight battery life ahead of the launch of the new OS , which is slated for July 29 . `` While we are working on technical optimisations , we have seen very minor hits to battery life but even the upper end of what we have seen is below 10 percent . Do know that we expect battery life on Windows 10 systems to be nearly the same as on Windows 8.1 systems once the final Windows 10 drivers have been updated and released , '' read a statement from Intel . Bugs on the first day of any new OS version are n't anything new and an entire OS on the level of Windows 10 will bring with it enough glitches that Microsoft is widely expected to bring a hefty Day 0 update to users on the first day . Sticking with the battery life issue , certain PC makers are unsurprisingly warning that turning Cortana on will have a detrimental effect on battery life and that `` Hey Cortana '' will mean an increase in CPU usage of about 6 % . Windows 10 gets its long-awaited release in a little under a week 's time with PC manufacturers , owners and Microsoft waiting with baited breath to see just how well it gets on in its new guise as `` Windows-as-a-Service '' .

Qualcomm is ready to cut 15 % of its workforce following a shocking set of results for the third quarter of 2015 that affirm the fact that competition in the mobile processor market continues to bite . Qualcomm 's quarterly earnings report revealed a 14 % revenue drop to $ 5.8 billion ( about £3.73 billion , AU $ 7.87 billion ) from $ 6.8 billion ( about £4.37 billion , AU $ 9.23 billion ) in 2014 - and that 's just the tip of the iceberg . Additionally , operating income dropped off by a shocking 40 % to $ 1.2 billion ( about £770 million , AU $ 1.63 billion ) in just a year and net income decreased by 47 % to $ 1.2 billion ( about £770 million , AU $ 1.63 billion ) . Following this body blow , Steve Mollenkoft , CEO of Qualcomm , told shareholders that a major restructuring is in order and 15 % of workers may lost their jobs . Most of the losses will come in the firm 's temporary workforce , engineering and the physical offices themselves , according to AnandTech . It 's easy to see where the loss comes from as Samsung , arguably Qualcomm 's biggest customer , chose to use own Exynos processors for its flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone rather than a Snapdragon chip . Additionally , the chip maker ran into trouble with overheating Snapdragon 810 chips , plus added research and development costs of an additional Snapdragon 808 chip . The hope is that the job losses will help it to save some $ 1.1 billion ( about £710 million , AU $ 1.49 billion ) in expenses per year . Qualcomm also plans to further reduce the annual share-based compensation by approximately $ 300 million ( around £193 million , or AU $ 407 million ) . The planned purge is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2016 . There are also plans to review the entire corporate structure of the firm , capital return opportunities , and any other way they can squeeze some more stockholder value from the firm . Despite all this doom and gloom , it should be pointed out that Qualcomm made a profit . Just not the big one that it was expecting .

Intel demoed Unite , its new collaboration solution , earlier today at an event in Central London . Unite was officially introduced globally at Computex in Taiwan early last month in partnership with HP . At its core is a mini desktop running a 4th or 5th generation Intel Core vPro processor , Windows 7/8.1 or Windows 10 and Intel 's Unite Software . In its simplest form , it is a video-conferencing platform that allows other OIC-compatible solutions ( Open Interconnect Consortium ) like Cisco Telepresence , Lighting Control and Panacast Control to plug in seamlessly . Chad Constant from Intel underlined how nearly two thirds of corporations have been undergoing a workplace transformation effort that includes killing the cubicle and making conference rooms smarter . Intel , he says , want to have more compute in the conference room as the prerequisite to enabling more things in the future . The company is not bent on making money from the software for now , focusing instead of building margin on the hardware . Constant sees a high potential for accessories for Intel and its partners and the momentum , if sustained , could see the ecosystem grow into something of a de facto semi-open standard for smart offices , a clear threat to established players . Currently five manufacturers ( Lenovo , Asus , Dell , Fujitsu and HP ) have confirmed that they will be releasing Unite systems with more OEMs coming later . VARs ( Value Added Resellers ) are also expected to sell Intel 's own NUC Unite solution , something that will not go well with its partners . Constant acknowledged that the current version of Unite , which requires a powerful vPro Broadwell or Haswell CPU , has its shortcomings . For example , the video frame rate is fairly low ( we noticed significant lag during the sessions ) , there 's no audio support for the time being and Mac compatibility is patchy at best . The current client application will target enterprise for now with SMBs being added to the mix later this year . But there 's more to come according to Constant . Future models – Intel has committed to a three-year roadmap and is working on improving the quality of the videos using existing/fixed processing resources . As for video in full HD at 60Hz ? Constant was adamant that it would happen very soon .

Asus and Dell have started the race towards Skylake ultrabook supremacy by revealing CPU updates for some of the most popular models out there . First reported by Notebook Italia , revamped versions of the Asus Zenbook UX303UB and Dell XPS 13 have started cropping up on retail sites across the continent offering Intel 's sixth generation Skylake CPU . The Zenbook UX303UB is an update to the ultrabook released last year and is expected to have a spec list similar to the original that includes an Nvidia GeForce GPU , Quad HD+ touchscreen display and of course an upgraded Intel Core i7-6500U chip . On Dell 's side of the market , the XPS 13 should have the same Intel Core chip , Dell 's popular infinity display , 8GB of RAM , a 256GB SSD , and a quad HD touchscreen option like above that gives it an edge against Apple 's MacBook Air . Skylake was unveiled at the annual intel Developer Forum earlier this month after a frenetic build-up that has gathered pace considerably in recent weeks . The new 14nm architecture pushes the envelope when it comes to speed and , at the same IDF 2015 gathering , it broke seven world records by achieving speeds of 6.8GHz quad-core with DDR4 data-reading at 4,795MT per second and a base clock rate of 552 MHz . Pricing for the two new laptops has yet to be revealed by Asus and Dell but you can expect the Dell XPS 13 to start at $ 799 ( £520 , AU $ 980 ) and the Zenbook UX303 to have a price point of $ 699 ( £649 , AU $ 902 ) .

While many are looking forward to Intel 's Sixth Generation Skylake CPU for its improved processing performance and power efficiency , the chip 's graphics may be its most underestimated asset . With Skylake , Intel 's Gen9 integrated graphics not only brings significantly better graphics performance to the average computing users , but Intel is also setting its sights on usurping the role of dedicated graphics , like those from Nvidia and rival AMD 's Radeon line . Intel has n't released specifics about Skylake or its integrated Gen9 graphics at IDF 2015 , opting instead to focus on wearables , RealSense and the Internet of Things . However , Intel has made significant progress with boosting its integrated graphics , two Intel insiders told techradar independently , which will `` soon result in Apple transitioning its MacBook Pro [ solely ] to Intel graphics . '' Today 's most expensive 15-inch MacBook Pro configuration comes with a discrete AMD Radeon R9 M370X graphics , but that may no longer be the case in the future if our intel on Intel is accurate . When pushed if this will happen in time for Apple 's Skylake refresh , our sources would not offer additional details . Apple reps have not responded to our request for comment . Winning over Apple will be a major coup for Intel in validating the power of its integrated graphics , which has been seen in the past as lagging behind dedicated graphics . Notorious for its attention to detail and focus on providing the best user experience for its customers , if Apple adopts Intel 's solution on its professional notebooks without requiring Nvidia or AMD Radeon for backup , it will be the second major stamp of approval for Intel . Apple gave Intel its first nod when it switched from Power PC processors to Intel 's x86 chips , which are now found on the company 's MacBook , MacBook Air and MacBook Pro laptop lineup as well as on desktops like the Mac Mini , iMac and Mac Pro . This would be an especially important win for Intel because many graphics and video professionals rely on Apple 's MacBook Pro to do production work . It would show that Intel 's solution can at the very least match the performance of the AMD Radeon R9 on this generation 's 15-inch MacBook Pro or the Nvidia GeForce GT970M on the prior generation model . In the past , Apple chose to rely on Intel 's premium integrated graphics architecture on its notebook line . Whereas PC rivals often use Intel HD graphics , Apple uses Intel 's higher-end Iris or Iris Pro graphics . The role of dedicated graphics would still be important on workstations , gaming rigs and dedicated mobile workstations , but Intel appears confident that Skylake will be powerful enough for the majority of computing users .

What do cell phones , laptops , flying drones , robots and cars have in common ? Intel 's vision is that these devices can connect to an even faster next generation 5G wireless network by 2020 . The 5G network will provide a backbone for Intel 's Internet of Things endeavors , a theme key to IDF 2015 , and allow devices to connect at up to 100 times faster speeds than current 4G LTE technology today . Another benefit of 5G networks is that there is very little latency or delays , which will enable real-time , instantaneous response , feedback and control of IoT devices . This opens the doors to remote robotic surgeries , self-driving cars and potentially even turning humans into droids . With delays as low as just 1ms , Intel claims that 5G will be suited for tele-medicine . The network will also have minimal impact on battery life . For devices that do n't need a constant connection , a battery can last up to 10 years on a single charge . Paul McNamara , Vice President at Ericsson , said that 5G networks can be very adaptable to prioritize important commands for critical response . For instance , for general safety , communications from a connected car can get prioritized in an event of a collision over a signal sent from a connected appliance . This way , the car can warn other nearby connected cars to brake while it is activating its airbags . This would be more critical than a connected appliance . Wearables will also benefit from greater and broader 5G connectivity and coverage . Sandra Rivera , Vice President and General Manager , Network Platforms Group at Intel Corporation , predicts that one day your body can speak to your appliances , cars and other connected devices . Rivera envisions a day when people will begin implanting chips into their body . The 5G future Intel wants can turn us into half-humans , half-Terminators . This means that rather than wearing wearables , the sensors could someday live in or on your body instead , said Alex Choi , Chief Technology Officer at SK Telecom . Want to find out more about 5G ?

Data is a thing of power and beauty , Intel announced in a video introducing its session on the Internet of Things and Big Data Insights , stating that data is an abundant resource that is underutilized . Data that can be securely shared can even lead to the cure for diseases like cancer and more personalized medical treatments . In its session on big data analytics , Intel demonstrated how industrial IoT devices can be connected and given RealSense cameras to sense , see and understand the world around them as they collect data . Scientist must process and analyze that data , and Intel announced a few new tools to help data scientists make sense of the data . Bryant called data `` the next big tech disrupter , '' and data , combined with the sensing IoT tech that collects data , can transform even the world 's oldest industry : agriculture . Big data can be used to help solve real-world problems , like cancer research in healthcare . Intel 's goal is to be able to map the human genome in one day to deliver precision healthcare that 's personalized towards the patient by 2020 . Why is precision healthcare important ? The primary reason is that treatment can be performed outside of the hospital . Intel says that the US spends $ 10 billion a year to fight infections contracted while patients are in the hospital . With IoT devices and remote medicine , patients can seek in-home care and therapy , rather than risk infection in hospitals , in many instances . In an Oregon trial , Intel provided 450 people with a connected blood pressure cuff and the Basis Peak smartwatch . These devices provided 300 million data points per night , which is more data than what can be collected in a doctor 's office visit . In helping to analyze and share this data in a safe and secure way , Intel announced its new Collaborative Cancer Cloud . Intel says that even when we have abundant collected data , the information is trapped because researchers are worried about the security implications of sharing . The benefit of sharing is that it can help speed up research , provide more rapid diagnosis and treatment and help researchers develop cures at a faster rate . To help researchers , the Collaborative Cancer Cloud will create a secure virtual machine for data to be shared . Once the information is shared , data is then wiped , said Diane Bryant , Intel Vice President and General Manager of Intel Data Center Group . Data can be used to help farmers understand more about their crops and fields , and this leads to the elimination of waste and an increase in production , Intel partner Farm Logs told the audience at IDF 2015 . Farm Logs demonstrated a new sensor hub called Flow , which can connect to farming machines and harvest data from sensor networks . Once the data is collected , processed and analyzed , farmers can make better decisions about fertilizing , pest control , crop disease and more , said Doug Davis , Intel Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel Internet of Things Group . Personalization is a big theme that was introduced by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich during his IDF keynote on Tuesday morning , and personalization results in being able to understand the world around you through seeing , hearing and touching . Can these inputs help create personalized farming equipment ? Davis tasked a group of Intel interns with the challenge of bringing the company 's RealSense 3D cameras to off-the-shelf robotics . Similar to Krzanich 's control of robotic spiders during his keynote , interns used a computer with a RealSense camera on stage to control manufacturing robot arms during the demo . Set to the tunes of Beyonce 's `` Single Ladies '' and Mark Ronson 's `` Uptown Funk '' interns used arm gestures to control the robot arms to dance . While the demonstration may not necessarily apply to agriculture , I can see the potential use of Intel 's RealSense technology for remote robotic surgeries in the future . Commercial IoT requires a platform that helps users make sense of the collected data with a scalable and flexible platform with tools , resources and technical support . Bryant claims that data is `` the currency of the digital world , '' but that it takes more than just data . Once data is collected , how do you make sense of the data ? Understanding the data is changing the conversation from data to algorithms , and this shift resulted in Harvard Business Review naming data scientist the top job of the 21st century . Intel made two announcements to help scientists understand the data . The first is Streaming SQL to enable real-time intelligence , and the second is Discovery Peak , an open-source , standards-based platform that Bryant claims will be easy to use , highly customizable to support your applications and innovative . Combined with fast memory from Intel 's 3D XPoint-based Optane SSDs , data scientists will be able to store more data and have quicker access to data . Optane claims to be the first non-volatile memory that can be used as main system memory .
New innovations are making technological products more accessible . One of the finalists for Intel 's Make it Wearable challenge showed that a bionic arm , traditionally sold for $ 10,000 , can be obtained for as little as $ 3,000 . Designed by the Open Bionics team , the 3D printed bionic arm is constructed with polymers with varying levels of firmness . The part that attaches to an amputee 's limb is made with a softer , more flexible material , while the hand and fingers are more rigid and firm . At the technology showcase at IDF 2015 , Open Bionics showed the arm in action . A band , with sensors and a custom board with Intel 's Quark microprocessor , is attached to the wearer 's forearm . When the sensors detect muscle contractions in your forearm , the hands and fingers move . Wearables and the design of personalized , connected accessories are the highlights of Intel CEO Brian Krzanich 's keynote on Tuesday morning . Intel showed off the power of its Intel Curie processor for IoT devices , which is based on the Quark design , in a variety of different applications , including as sensors for BMX bicycles . Open Bionics 's bionic arm certainly fits Krzanich 's vision for Intel 's future . The diminutive Quark microprocessor inside the arm provides powerful instructions to control individual finger movement and helps users articulate the hand . According to the team , the bionic hand can grip a bottle of water , but I was n't able to witness that in the IDF demo . Additonally , with 3D printing , upgrading the bionic arm will be less expensive than commercial solutions available today . Open Bionics informed me that the arm must be adjusted as a user grows , especially in the case of pediatric amputees . With the Open Bionics solution , the battery , electronic components and Quark processor can be saved and reused . All that is needed is a new 3D printed arm in a larger size . While it 's easy to imagine a fun and immersive world of IoT gadgets , computing does n't get anymore personal than a connected limb attached to your body .
Skylake has been the talk of the town since it was unveiled two weeks ago . Today , at Intel 's developer 's conference , IDF 2015 , the chip 's manufacturer provided additional details about the processor 's 14nm architecture . By leveraging a wider core than its predecessors , Skylake is designed to provide smarter instructions for each intended processing action , as well as improved energy efficiency . The chip , although featuring a wider core , will be smaller than previous Broadwell and Haswell processors , which will help Intel sell it to manufacturers as a processor for wearables and other small form factor computers . Read more : Intel Core i9-9980XE When overclocked , Skylake broke seven world records and was able to achieve speeds of 6.8 GHz quad-core , with DDR4 data-reading at 4,795MT per second and a base clock rate of 552 MHz . The chip is also being marketed to help boost display output and energy performance , as well as image signal processing on cameras . Intel claims Skylake can power a 13 megapixel camera with zero shutterlag , and record up to 2160 resolution video from four cameras with two running simultaneously . Additionally , the Skylake chip offers enhanced graphics performance by leveraging embedded dynamic random access memory ( eDRAM ) and up to OpenGL 4.4 APIs . On Skylake , eDRAM is called eDRAM+ , and this memory will serve as a cache for both the CPU and GPU . This will help bring improved performance to general computing tasks and not just gaming . Skylake can also be used to drive video output to multiple displays , even on mobile form factors . In a gaming demonstration , Kirk Skaugen , Intel Client Computing Group Senior Vice President and General Manager , said that even a slim device , like a prototype Microsoft Surface Pro tablet , can drive up three 4K displays at 60 frames per second . However , when asked about specific details about Skylake , Julius Mandelblat , Senior Principle Engineer at Intel declined to comment , noting that `` today is not the launch of Skylake . '' The chip wo n't come for another couple of weeks , according to another Intel official in the room . A new feature called Speed Shift will help Skylake remain efficient while delivering high performance . Speed Shift allows the processor to change its power state , which will make the computing experience feel more responsive . This will help PCs resume more quickly and perform better when in a power-saving state , features both beneficial to notebook users . Intel did not provide details on what kind of battery life gains you can expect from Skylake over the current Fifth Generation Broadwell architecture during the IDF session . Likely , these details will arrive when the chip launches officially . In addition to delivering better performance , Intel introduced two new security extensions to help safeguard your system . With Software Guard Extension , or SGX , Intel hopes to reduce privilege attacks . The second extension is the Memory Protection Extension , or MPX , which can `` help identify errant pointer usage prior to release as well as mitigate exposure at runtime . ''
With a dense , stackable design , Intel has been promoting the merits of 3D XPoint as being significantly faster than the storage available today . The technology was developed jointly between Intel and Micron , and at IDF 2015 Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that Intel will be bringing 3D XPoint to market in 2016 under its Intel Optane brand . Optane promises to be 1,000 times faster with 1,000 times the endurance of NAND while being 10 times denser than conventional memory . Because memory is written at the cell level rather than in block arrays , data can be accessed more quickly and efficiently with Optane 's 3D XPoint technology . On stage , Krzanich showed that an early prototype of an Optane SSD can access data up to seven times faster than Intel 's leading NAND-based solid state drive . Krzanich says that this is the world 's first live demonstration of 3D XPoint in action . Intel said that Optane products will be available in standard solid state PCIe form factors as well as a DIMM module . The PCIe form factor can be used in form factors spanning Ultrabooks to servers , while the DIMM module can be used in Xeon-based systems for more bandwidth . Intel did not announce pricing for Optane . The 2016 availability matches what Micron announced . In late June , Intel and Micron told TechRadar that even though the technology is jointly developed , each company will go to market separately with its own products . According to Intel , 3D XPoint and Optane is the first memory breakthrough in 25 years since the arrival of NAND . Intel said that when coupled with Skylake and the new integrated Iris and Iris Pro graphics , gamers will also see speed improvements with Optane , Intel said in a separate gaming-focused session at IDF . Optane can lead to more realistic and immersive gaming experiences with faster refresh rates . For enterprises , Optane can be used for faster data analysis and real-time analytics .
Over $ 34 billion are spent on PC games this year . Worldwide , there are 1.8 billion gamers , of which 1.2 billion consider themselves to be active gamers . Active gamers pay for a new game each month , and they upgrade their systems every two to three years on average , compared with PC users who hold onto their PCs for around six years . These numbers are important to Intel , which hopes that users will upgrade to its Sixth Generation Skylake processors . At IDF 2015 , Doug Fisher , Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel 's Software and Services Group , and Kirk Skaugen , Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel Client Computing Group , showed off key features of Intel 's hardware that make it appealing to gamers . Not only does Skylake provide CPU improvements over the previous Fifth Generation Broadwell architecture , but Fisher and Skaugen pointed out that Skylake will also come with improved graphics capabilities with Intel 's integrated Iris and Iris Pro . Gaming is not just about play . Gamification in schools can help motivate students and encourage learning . 74 % of teachers use games in curriculum , according to Fisher , and games can help the elderly keep their minds active . Gaming also affects non-gamers as well . Doctors who spend on average three hours a week playing games make 37 % fewer errors and operate 27 % faster in surgeries . Fisher notes that games help refine motor skills . Intel announced its Skylake processors at Computex , which comes with an overclocked K SKU for gamers . These performance machines also comes with Intel 's integrated Iris and Iris Pro graphics . Overclocked systems come can go in excess of 4GHz with multi-core setups . On stage , Skaugen showed off the power of Skylake , which not only can handle 4K UHD video output at 60 frames per second , but can do so on up to three 4K displays . Iris graphics can pump video out to three 4K monitors simultaneously , so gamers will be able to create a multi-monitor setup with Intel 's integrated graphics . For professional users , the improved CPU and GPU performance of Skylake means that you can also setup workstations with multiple screens . But beyond that , Intel is pushing performance into smaller packages so that slim devices , like a prototype Microsoft Surface Pro tablet with Skylake , can also push out 4K video to three displays . This brings the power of a desktop down to even mobile devices . Performance will also be improved with Intel 's Optane memory , which is based on the previously announced 3D XPoint memory architecture . Optane will hit SSDs next year , said CEO Brian Krzanich in his IDF keynote Tuesday morning , providing speeds up to seven times that of NAND storage . Optane 's fast speeds will allow games to look more realistic with faster refresh rates , and enterprise customers can also perform real-time analytics on larger data sets . With its RealSense 3D camera , Intel wants the gaming experience to be personalized . RealSense can be used for the front-facing camera on tablets and phones to enable gesture input as well as on the rear of the camera to scan objects for simulation . As part of his demonstration , Skaugen showed that you can use the rear camera to scan yourself . It takes Skylake about two to three minutes to render your scanned image , but once this is completed , you can insert yourself into the game to create a highly personalized gamin experience . In another example , objects are scanned into the game . For instance , healing objects and health objects in the game , which are depicted as first aid kids in some current games , can be replaced with whatever you choose . In the Intel demo , a koala bear was scanned and used as a healing object in a game that is developed with China-based Tencent .

At IDF 2015 , Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced Tuesday that Intel is partnering with Google to bring Intel 's RealSense 3D camera to Google 's Project Tango smartphone . Krzanich showed off a prototype of the un-named smartphone prototype , which is running the company 's Atom processor and comes with a 6-inch display . RealSense 3D enables more computing possibilities on a smartphone . For one , users can begin making 3D scans and models in real-time . At the technology showcase at IDF , the prototype that I played with came pre-loaded with a few apps and games that benefit from the `` world-oriented , '' otherwise known as rear-mounted , '' dual-camera setup . Beyond just simple scans , you can map the world around you with RealSense 3D . By using the camera , users can begin modeling their living room or garden , and then they can build off of that map by placing furniture , flowers or plants into the space . This would be a good app for a landscape or interior designer . Architects can also create immersive building experiences . They can create a home , for example , and then with the camera , they can walk through and traverse the different rooms in the home on a 3D augmented reality tour with their smartphone display . In the example shown at the technology showcase , Intel staff members at the Project Tango booth built a brick home , and you can virtually `` crawl '' through the brick rooms . Rather than strapping a phone to your head a la augmented reality and virtual reality glasses , you can attach a RealSense-enabled phone onto toys and peripherals to enhance the experience . In another demonstration , Intel attached the phone to a Nerf-like gun . Rather than shooting real Nerf ammunition , you get an augmented reality experience . This could very well be the perfect toy for parents as kids wo n't be able to do any `` real '' damage with their virtual bullets . Intel said that the Project Tango phone shown at IDF 2015 is only a prototype and it 's up to OEMs to bring RealSense to market . Intel is n't disclosing component costs , saying it varies by volume . The company would not disclose what type of premium a phone with RealSense will have when questioned .
At IDF 2015 , Intel focuses on the computing experience , rather than its big name processor , like Skylake . CEO Brian Krzanich highlighted the computing experiences that 's enabled by devices like Intel 's RealSense 3D camera , the Intel Curie platform for Internet of Things and wearables . The computing experience is delivered based on three assumptions , Krzanich said during his keynote . These include sensification , smart and connected devices and experiences that are more personal and an extension of you . With sensification , Intel hopes that its developer partners will work to deliver a more immersive computing experience . Instead of being confined to a 2D world , that 's often defined by a keyboard and mouse experience , sensification brings added dimensions to the computing experience with feedback . With Intel Smart Sound technology , for example , Intel adds extra capabilities into the Cortana digital assistant on Windows 10 . There is an integrated digital signal processor that 's always listening , and this allows you to use voice to wake up your PC from a power saving state . On stage , Krzanich 's team showed that you can say `` Hey Cortana , wake up '' to command your PC to wake up your PC . It takes about five seconds for the PC to wake up from hibernation with just your voice command . With RealSense , Intel is expanding the use beyond just password authentication . Working with Google , Intel is bringing RealSense to smartphones like Project Tango . With RealSense on your phone , you can use the camera to create 3D scans and maps . RealSense is not only a great camera , Krzanich said , but it can also measure depth and positioning . As one example , Intel talked about a drone equipped with RealSense navigating through a forest of trees . Called the `` Game of Drones , '' Krzanich said that RealSense , along with fast , real-time computing , helped the drone avoid crashing into trees . RealSense can also power the next generation of robotics . Working with Savioke , RealSense can be added to robot butlers , like the Relay . This way , robots can navigate around the physical world and avoid obstacles , preventing collisions with humans . To make RealSense smarter , Intel says you can add connectivity to bring real-time feedback . One example is a new smart mirror developed by Memoi that is available at high-end retailer Nieman Marcus . These mirrors can superimpose different color options on clothing , so you can try on a red jacket and see how a blue , black or purple jacket will look on you . When you 're done trying it on , you can share the images and videos with friends so they can help you decide what 's the best color and fit . For gamers , Razer is making a RealSense peripheral that can track where your eyes are looking in a game . In a demonstration of a racing game , when the player moves his focus , the view of the game also adjusts on the screen . Turn your head to the left , and the view of your race shifts to the left . This makes gaming more immersive , Krzanich said . A connected Nabi babyseat is another way that connectivity can make IoT more practical . If the Nabi babyseat buckle is connected , and you walk out of Bluetooth range of the seat , your phone will send you visual and audible alerts to warn you that your baby is still in the seat . Intel says that this will help prevent the deaths of forty or so babies that are left behind in car seats everywhere . Additionally , Intel is working with partners Microchip and Amtel to bring its Enhanced Privacy ID , or EPIC , security to IoT devices . EPIC brings silicon-level root of trust security to deliver secure , anonymous communications for IoT devices . A simple way to make computing personal is to expand into the wearables space . Intel partner Fossil Group showed off a collection of braccelets , smart watches and a connected watch with a digital display on stage . Fossil says that its watches will be available under its own brand as well as through partner brands , like Armani , Michael Kors and Tory Burch . For IoT devices , Intel showed off the capabilities of its Intel Curie processor , which is the brains behind gadgets that need to connect . For example , in extreme sports , like BMX biking , Curie can be embedded into the handle bars and car seats , and Intel says that additional sensors can even connect to Curie . Curie gives real-time data on the movement of the handles , rotation and how the bike 's body moves . This data allows the athlete to train better and for the audience to understand how tricks and stunts are performed . Wearables can also make it more safe and easy for log into your computer . Similar to how Apple Pay requires you to authenticate once on the Apple Watch , a new Intel bracelet prototype allows you to quickly log into Windows 10 when you 're within proximity of your PC . To keep things even more secure , once you take your bracelet off , you 'll need to authenticate again with your password . This way , if someone steals your laptop and your wearable , they ca n't access your data . The technology integrates with Bluetooth Low Energy , uses Intel 's ID IQ and integrates with TrueKey . To bring more devices to market , Intel partnered with famed reality television producer Mark Burnett to host a new competition called the America 's Greatest Maker 's challenge , with winners set to receive $ 1 million . The challenge , hopefully , will bring more personal and connected devices that helps bridge the digital and physical world .

Lenovo gave its mobile workstations major performance boosts today , unveiling a pair of models at the SIGGRAPH 2015 show . Even though the new laptops carry the same design aesthetics as Lenovo 's ThinkPad W541 , these mobile powerhouses are the first to feature Intel 's Xeon processors . The two models include a 17.3-inch ThinkPad P70 and a 15.6-inch ThinkPad P50 . Both models usher in the end of Lenovo 's ThinkPad W series as Lenovo begins standardizing on the P Series brand , for power , performance and ports . Popular models in the W Series in the past include the ThinkPad W540 , ThinkPad W541 and ThinkPad W550s . The W Series has n't seen a major power upgrade for some time , forcing users to choose between models with an older and more powerful quad-core Haswell processor or the newer and more energy efficient dual-core Broadwell chip from Intel . Under the P Series , with a brand new Intel Sixth Generation Skylake processor mobile Xeon chip , users no longer have to make the compromise between power and performance . The ThinkPad P70 is the flagship model in Lenovo 's new P Series and brings a number of firsts to the ThinkPad line . It 's the first mobile workstation to feature a 17.3-inch screen , as prior models have maxed out at a 15-inch display . It 's also the first to feature a high resolution 4K UHD display , besting the 3K screens on older models . Power users will also appreciate that the P70 can be maxed out with a 2TB hard disk drive and 1TB SSD for a total of 3TB storage , 64GB DDR4 RAM , swappable optical drive bay and Nvidia Quadro graphics . The ThinkPad P70 and the smaller P50 both come with Intel Sixth Generation Skylake or Xeon family processors . In an interview with TechRadar , Brooks Flynn , Worldwide Segment Marketing Manager at Lenovo , would not give specifics about the Quadro graphics . Instead , Flynn told us to confirm the information with Nvidia , leading us to speculate that this may be a new and unannounced GPU . One of the highlights of the P70 is that it comes with plenty of ports . The laptop accommodates HDMI 1.4 , Mini DisplayPort 1.2 , Ethernet , docking connector , headphone and microphone combo jack , Smart Card reader , ExpressCard 34 and SDXC memory card slot in addition to the four USB 3.0 ports and two Thunderbolt 3 ports . Hopefully , with the power of Intel 's Xeon family of processors on a laptop for the first time and the assortment of ports on the ThinkPad P70 , you can leave behind your desktop workstation without compromising on productivity when you travel or work remotely . Gone from the prior ThinkPad W Series is the swappable Power Bridge Technology battery . This means you ca n't replace a depleted battery for a fresh one while you 're working in the field , but fortunately the new Intel processor promises better battery life . Lenovo rates the 8-cell battery for between five and six hours of use . Likely , you 'll still want to be within range of a power outlet as this wo n't get you through a full work day . The cost to having this much power is size and weight . The ThinkPad P70 comes in a 7.6 pounds ( 3.4kg ) and measures 16.4 x 10.8 x 1.2 inches ( 416 x 275.5 x 31.5mm ) . Equipped with a 15.6-inch display and 4K UHD resolution , the P50 shares many of the features that make the P70 a great desktop replacement , including a Xeon processor , dedicated Nvidia Quadro graphics , 64GB DDR4 RAM and maximum 3TB storage . The ThinkPad P50 has all the connectivity of the larger P70 except the two Thunderbolt 3 ports . You can configure the ThinkPad P50 with either a 4-cell or 6-cell battery . Lenovo rates battery life at 3.6 hours with the smaller battery and six hours with the larger capacity battery . Like the P70 , the battery can not be replaced . Lacking the swappable optical drive , the P50 is slightly slimmer than the larger P70 . It measures 14.86 x 9.93 x 1.02 inches ( 377.4 x 252.3 x 24.5 - 25.9mm ) and weighs 5.6 pounds ( 2.5kg ) . For users requiring production-quality displays , both ThinkPad P Series models feature an integrated X-Rite Pantone color calibration reader built into the keyboard deck adjacent to the touchpad . The screen can achieve 100 % color gamut , according to Lenovo , and you can calibrate the display to achieve more accurate colors by running the pre-installed utility , shutting the lid down and letting the software read and adjust your screen 's settings . For users working in environments requiring added security , Lenovo also has a new fingerprint reader . Whereas the older ThinkPad W550s and ThinkPad W541 feature a swipe to scan reader , the new biometric scanner on the P Series requires you to touch your finger to the reader to scan . The new reader takes up more surface area , but is far easier to use , said Flynn , because it does n't require you to hold your finger at a specific angle or swipe your finger at a specific speed . If you 've used a ThinkPad notebook before , you 'll be delighted to know that Lenovo 's excellent keyboard makes a return on the P Series , featuring full-sized island-style keys with curved key caps and comfortable key travel . The P Series make use of dual mouse input with a red TrackPoint nub and also a trackpad . Unlike the recent ThinkPad W541 and ThinkPad W550s , the trackpad features three buttons , rather than just a large clickable surface . The ThinkPad P70 starts at $ 1,999 ( £1,281 , AU $ 2,696 ) and the ThinkPad P50 starts at $ 1,599 ( £1,025 , AU $ 2,156 ) . Both laptops will be available in the final quarter of this year .

Intel processors from the late 90s reportedly have a hidden flaw that allows rootkits to be installed by malicious actors . A security researcher has claimed that a design flaw in the x86 processor from 1997 has lain undiscovered until now and would allow attackers to implement a root kit in the low-level firmware that is virtually undetectable by security products , reports PC World . The feature added to the x86 architecture in 1997 was disclosed at the Black Hat security conference by Christopher Domas from the Battelle Memorial Institute . Domas revealed that the toolkit can be successfully installed in the System Management Mode ( SMM ) . Once an attacker has done that , the flaw can be used to delete the UEFI ( Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ) , the BIOS or reinfect the OS following a clean install . Domas goes on to add that starting up in Secure Boot mode wo n't help one jot as that relies on the SMM to run correctly . Before panic sets in , be advised that attackers need to have kernel or system privileges on the computer in question to be able to exploit the flaw . Domas also went on to claim that x86 processors made by AMD may even be affected , however , no testing has been done to indicate that as being the case . To prevent the flaw being exploited , Intel is rolling out firmware updates for older processors and has mitigated against the issue in its latest CPUs , however , Domas claimed that not all of the older processors can even be patched .

Earlier this year , a little-known Chinese company emerged as a potential suitor for AMD , the US-based archrival to Intel . That company , Loongson , shares common roots with Lenovo , the world 's biggest PC manufacturer and has quietly amassed a rumoured war chest of 120 billion yuan ( about $ 18.8bn , £12.1bn , AU $ 26.3bn ) . A massive bounty that it may want to use to take on the global microprocessor market ( CPU or processors for the rest of us ) which is currently dominated by Intel and ARM . We caught up with the president of Loongson , Weiwu Hu , to discuss about the company 's plans . ( Thanks to A.Voica from Imagination Technologies for his help setting up this interview ) Techradar Pro : What computer do you use every day ? Weiwu Hu : [ I use ] is a laptop that uses our Loongson CPU . I have been using PCs and laptops with Loongson CPUs for my daily work for more than 5 years . In fact , the answers for this Q & A have been written on that same Loongson platform , the one you see in the picture . TRP : Can you tell us more about Loongson , where it comes from , why it was launched and how big the company is ? WH : We originally started in 2001 as a CPU research center that was part of the Institute of Computing Technology ( ICT ) inside the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CAS ) . In 2010 , according to the requirements of ICT-CAS , we decided to set up Loongson Technology Corporation Ltd. with a clear mission to bring the fruits of our research work to the market . We soon found that we needed to refocus our research to fully meet the requirements of the computing market . For example , academic research in ICT promoted the use of many-core architectures for chip design , but the consumer market required dual-core or quad-core products that were missing from our roadmap . Furthermore , we discovered there was more work to be done to improve the performance of our Loongson CPU . We thus worked hard to improve the micro-architecture dramatically . Today , we are very excited to announce that the sophistication of the Loongson GS464E micro-architecture is on par with Intel 's Ivy Bridge , which enables us to address many market requirements . We have around 300-400 hardware and software engineers developing our core CPU technologies but also software and toolchains , rivalling the size and scope of many processor companies . Additionally , our ecosystem of our customers and partners has rapidly grown to include over 10,000 software and hardware engineers developing products based on our CPU technology . TRP : Why did you choose MIPS and not ARM as most other vendors ? WH : Our goal is to build a new ecosystem that will challenge the existing CPU providers . The MIPS architecture provides a way for us to differentiate and quickly achieve our goal . MIPS provides very high performance at lower power and reduced area in comparison with their direct competitors . By choosing MIPS64 , we also have access to the one of the most mature 64-bit software ecosystems in the industry . In addition , the MIPS architecture license is more flexible than ARM . For example , MIPS customers can add new instructions through UDI ( User-defined interface ) . TRP : You also developed your own Linux distribution . Why was that the case ? WH : Firstly , we try to contribute as much as possible to the open source community . For example , Loongson Technology is one of the 14 companies working on ( Google 's ) Chromium , and contributed almost 100,000 lines code to this project . Secondly , we have several operating system partners and many PC and server customers in China that prefer to use LOONGNIX , our in-house Linux distribution . Servicing all these partners one by one would have been an inefficient approach , so we decided to create and maintain LOONGNIX to service them in parallel . This also enables us to collaborate with our partners and continuously improve the ecosystem of Loongson CPU together . TRP : Your focus seems to be on desktop , servers and embedded . What about mobile ? WH : The most important factor for us is to focus on certain industries where we believe we can make a difference , rather than trying to hit all possible markets . We currently have a development plan that stretches to 2020 . We plan to support customers in desktop , servers and embedded markets . We also have CPUs used in mobile devices running Android and Linux OS , but only for certain very well-defined applications . Our goal is to start with the markets mentioned that require good embedded performance , then evolve to markets with more high-performance applications running on general purpose operating systems . We plan to expand into the open computing market after 2020 . TRP : Could you tell us more about LoongBT and how it could help developers ? WH : LoongBT is a set of instructions added to MIPS to speed up binary translation of x86 and ARM applications running on a Loongson CPU . 90 % of the instructions of x86 , ARM and MIPS ISAs have the same core functionality . Therefore implementing a binary translation mechanism for these instructions from x86 and ARM to MIPS was a smooth process that resulted in high efficiency . But we found that the other 10 % may greatly reduce binary translation efficiency – code would run up to 10 times slower without hardware acceleration . LoongBT implements acceleration for these 10 % x86 and ARM instructions using the MIPS instruction format to make the translation of all instructions from x86 and ARM to MIPS very efficient , and more than 10 times faster . Of course , the run time structure such as registers and TLB should also be improved and that improvement is part of LoongBT . On top of these ISA additions , we are also working at the API level such as Java , JavaScript , QT , ART , etc . We hope to produce an efficient software package that provides APIs that can work across multiple operating systems such as Linux , Android and Windows . We are developing the binary translation software and will provide it to our partners freely . We believe competition in CPU design is a good thing for both suppliers and customers and that everyone should have access to an open computing ecosystem that is free of any monopoly . We hope to remove the barrier between different ecosystems with this technology improvement . TRP : How do you see the global market for processors evolving over the next 12 months . Any trends ( HSA , lower power consumption , greater role of GPU etc ) ? WH : As I said , now we are mainly focusing on applications and use cases for certain industries . Loongson is still a small CPU company and it is more important for us to work closely with our customers to understand their requirements , rather than simply pursue international trends . We 've found that if we work hard with partners and customers to build this new ecosystem , we can create highly optimized solutions that are much better than repurposed generic systems from mainstream providers - even though each part of the system might not be as good as its mainstream counterpart . TRP : What is your relationship with AMD ? WH : Loongson CPUs use the HyperTransport system bus [ from AMD ] , and some Loongson motherboards use AMD 's chipsets .

Intel wants to foster collaboration in the connected vehicle sector through the launch of the new Automated Security Review Board ( ASRB ) . The new board is committed to making sure that the connected cars of the future are completely secure . The group 's initial remit will be to focus on the cyber-physical systems that control everything inside the vehicle . `` We can , and must , raise the bar against cyberattacks in automobiles , '' said Chris Young , SVP and GM of Intel Security . `` With the help of the ASRB , Intel can establish security best practices and encourage that cybersecurity is an essential ingredient in the design of every connected car . Few things are more personal than our safety while on the road , making the ASRB the right idea at the right time . '' Cyber physical is used to describe the system of different computational elements that control physical things , which in the case of connected cars is basically anything that contributes towards it staying on the road . Intel 's part in the whole process will be to provide an automotive advanced development platform on which to conduct research . Findings will then be available when they are discovered . Intel will also award a new car to the member of the group that provides the best contribution , thus making sure the board is constantly working towards the highest safety standards possible . Security is one of the key concerns surrounding the connected cars of the future and alongside the formation of the ASRB , the Intel Security-owned McAfee brand produced a white paper explaining all the different security implications of driverless cars . Some of the major areas it has flagged up are steering and braking , remote keys , airbags and lighting systems . By forming a board of this ilk it will go some way to assuage the doubts of those worried about connected cars and bring forth a standardised set of security practices that connected cars can abide by .

At IFA 2015 , Lenovo unveiled refreshed notebooks from its ThinkPad and IdeaPad lineup complete with Intel 's sixth generation Skylake processor . Compared to PCs released just five years ago in 2010 , Intel claims that Skylake delivers up to 2.5 times better processor performance , 30 times the graphics improvement and three times better battery life . If you 've been holding out on upgrading your ultrabook , laptop or desktop , hopefully Skylake 's performance gains will entice you to one of Lenovo 's new systems . Along with its new laptops , Lenovo is also introducing a redesigned logo and branding . On its consumer laptops , the `` L '' in the Lenovo logo is now capitalized , but Lenovo is dropping capitalization on its consumer-based ideapad range , which is now in lowercase . Additionally , it is making its models easier to understand . Lenovo is moving towards three-digit series numbers . For example , a 100 series will be an entry-level model with base configurations and a more affordable price . The 300 and 500 series will come with better material selections , upgraded components , and represents Lenovo 's more mainstream mid-range lineup . Finally , a 700 series is the top-of-the-line model with even more premium materials and components . The consumer IdeaPad offerings will be available in October . In addition to these laptops , Lenovo also introduced a Surface Pro 3 challenger in the form of the IdeaPad MIIX 700 tablet . The IdeaPad `` S '' series represents Lenovo 's consumer Ultrabook laptops , featuring a thinner design than the non-S series and more premium materials . The Lenovo IdeaPad 100S is available in either an 11.6-inch ( $ 189 , £122 , AU $ 264 ) or 14-inch ( $ 259 , £167 , AU $ 362 ) configurations . The 11.6-inch comes with a quad-core Intel Atom Z3735F processor , while the larger model is equipped with a Celeron N3050 CPU . Both models are available in black , feature a 1,366 x 768-pixel screen resolution , are rated for eight hours of battery life and come with 2GB RAM . The smaller model has two USB 2.0 ports and 32GB storage , while the 14-inch laptop comes with 64GB storage and one USB 3.0 , 2 USB 2.0 , HDMI port and SD card reader . The 11.6-inch model has a thickness of 0.69 inches ( 1.75cm ) and weighs 2.2 pounds ( 0.99kg ) . The 14-inch has a thickness of 0.73 inches ( 1.85cm ) and weighs 3.1 pounds ( 1.41kg ) . The IdeaPad 300S ( $ 249 , £162 , AU $ 349 ) and 500S ( starting at $ 499 , £325 , AU $ 701 ) are available in Ebony Black , Platinum Silver or Flamenco Red colors . The IdeaPad 300S comes with an 11-inch screen and quad-core Intel Pentium Braswell N3700 processor , while the more premium 500S is available in 13- , 14- or 15.6-inch FHD screen configurations and can be configured with up to an Intel Skylake Core i7 processor .

The Intel model starts at $ 499 ( £323 , AU $ 699 ) and $ 849 ( £550 , AU $ 1,189 ) , respectively . Both notebooks have a thickness of 0.96 inches ( 2.44cm ) and the 14-inch starts at 4.6 pounds ( 2.09kg ) , while the 15-inch starts at 5.1 pounds ( 2.31kg ) .
With more than half of the PCs in the world more now five years or older , Intel says that this is the time to upgrade to a new desktop , laptop or tablet . At IFA 2015 , Intel officially took the wraps off of its sixth generation processor , known as Skylake , and the company is packing in the performance to tempt owners of older laptops to upgrade . So how does Skylake compare to CPUs running on systems from five years ago ? `` Skylake delivers 2.5 times faster compute performance , 30 times better graphics and three times the battery life , '' said Kirk Skaugen , Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel 's Client Computing Group . Compared to laptops from just five years ago , Skylake will have four times faster wake-up times , said Navin Shenoy , Intel Corporate VP and General Manager of Mobility Client Platforms . There are over a billion PCs that are over three years old , and that 's the market that Skaugen and his team are targeting with Skylake . On mobile , Skylake is a highly scalable architecture , said Schlomit Weiss , VP of Intel 's Platform Engineering Group . The architecture can work on 4.5W on tablets running Core M processors to 45W on more advanced laptops , Ultrabooks and mobile workstations . Additionally , Skylake is also found on desktops . There are three different families of mobile architectures in Skylake 's architecture family , with each successive series consuming more power and delivering better performance . The Y-Series is a 4.5W processor that 's more commonly known as Intel Core M. This model is found in light laptops , tablets and 2-in-1 systems . The next model is the U-Series , which are the Intel Core i processors used on Ultrabooks . These processors consume just 15W of power . And finally , the more powerful Core i processors used on mobile workstations are found in Intel 's H-Series family , which are 45W processors . These processors are the most efficient that Intel has ever created , Shenoy boasted in a meeting ahead of IFA 2015 , stating that Core processors on Skylake use up to 60 % and are up to 60 % faster compared with a Haswell processor from two years ago . In fact , the processors are eight times more efficient than Intel 's best from five years ago , leading to two times better processor performance at just a quarter of the thermal power . Haswell was succeeded by Broadwell , and Skylake is the followup to Broadwell . In addition to the Skylake family designed for laptops and tablets , Intel also has the H-Series for desktops . On desktops , Skylake provides a 10 % boost in processor performance and 20 % increase in graphics performance compared to Broadwell , said Gregory Bryant , Corporate VP and General Manager of Intel 's Client Computing Group Desktop Client Platforms . In addition to processing improvements , the integrated Intel HD 500 graphics also got a boost with Skylake . The Intel HD 500 graphics will let you watch up to ten hours of HD video on a single battery charge . You can also create content , with up to 20 % faster 4K video encoding . For those looking to consume 4K video , Intel HD 500 graphics can drive up to three displays showing 4K videos at 60 frames per second . Gamers will appreciate the 40 % better performance when it comes to 3D rendering . Intel 's more advanced graphics , known as Intel Iris , will finally be available on 15W U-Series graphics . Previously , it was available on the H-Series on laptops , and Iris has been a staple on Apple 's MacBook Pro series . Iris will deliver even better performance on Skylake thanks to integrated eDRAM . Systems with Iris graphics wo n't ship until later this year , and Intel says that Iris Pro will arrive in 2016 . Currently , the most mainstream notebook that uses Iris Pro is Apple 's 15-inch MacBook Pro . With Intel 's timeline , this could mean we wo n't see a MacBook Pro refresh until 2016 at the earliest . The biggest news when it comes to graphics , Skaugen claims , is that Iris can deliver up to 80 % of the performance of the discrete graphics chips on the market today , which is a significant performance improvement . In fact , Iris on Skylake delivers up to 100 times the graphics performance compared to just a decade ago . `` Intel is going from predictable to incredible , '' Shenoy said . These graphics gains may be enough to force Apple to re-think the use of dedicated GPUs on its MacBook Pros , two Intel insiders told techradar .
If your desk is now overrun with wires running between your laptop 's power , HDMI , USB and Thunderbolt port , Intel hopes to bring some relief to your tangled reality in 2016 . Intel will support Rezence wireless charging , said Kirk Skaugen , Senior VP and GM of Intel 's Client Computing Group . Unlike more popular competing inductive wireless charging standards , like Qi , Rezence does n't require you to line up your devices perfectly with the charging plate , Intel executives highlighted as a benefit of the Rezence solution . The standard will be supported by Intel 's Cannonlake and Kaby Lake architectures , and wireless charging will start to appear on systems shipping in the second half of 2016 , Skaugen told techradar ahead of Skylake 's launch in San Francisco , California . Unfortunately , this means that you 'll need new hardware . The wireless charging will be built into the keyboards of laptops and the keyboard docks of two-in-one convertible systems . In a demo at IDF 2015 , Intel executives showed that the charging plate could be mounted under table tops and does n't require you to embed the plate within the table surface , saving cost . Once electronics , like laptops and smartphones , are placed on the table , charging begins . Essentially , you 'll have one wire connecting the charging plate to your power outlet , but you wo n't need to plug in your devices to power cords once you have OEMs build in Rezence charging receivers into their devices . Wireless charging is the last component of Intel 's vision for a world without wires . Skylake will help users shed wires from their devices . Intel 's sixth generation architecture will come with support for wireless display , docking and conference room technologies through WiDi , WiGig and Unite , respectively . We 've already begun to see these technologies appear with Broadwell-based systems , but Intel promises that more models will be coming . WiDi will essentially allow users to ditch the HDMI or video output cable on their systems . It will allow you to mirror your laptop 's display on a larger monitor without wires . WiGig is an extension of that , and the protocol is currently supported on select Broadwell systems from Dell and HP , Intel executives told techradar at an IDF 2015 demo . WiGig allows you to connect your USB peripherals and display to a WiGig hub . Once your laptop is within proximity of the hub , it will recognize your peripherals and displays so you do n't have to plug these accessories directly into your laptop 's ports . Your laptop will recognize USB flash drives , hard drives , keyboard , mouse , printers , monitors and other accessories that are plugged into the WiGig hub . For security , only one laptop can be connected to a WiGig hub at a single time . The last part of the technology is Intel Unite , which allows you to collaborate and share your screen wirelessly in a conference room . It also allows remote conference participants to share their screens and log into a conference room when they 're at a different location . Through these technologies , Intel hopes to free your laptop from its tethered chains on your desk . There will still be wires , but those wires wo n't have to be connected to your tablet or laptop . Instead , they 'll run through the WiGig docking station or to the Rezence charging plate .
Intel 's current Core M processor is an energy efficient chip that brought enough processing power to current laptops and tablets like Apple 's MacBook , Dell 's Venue 11 Pro 7000 Series and Lenovo 's Yoga Pro 3 . However , one of the complaints with the M architecture is that for heavy processing tasks , these systems can feel slow , but the tradeoff is that you get better battery life in a thin , fanless design . With the second generation of Core M processor , Intel promises significantly better performance . Thanks to Skylake 's underlying platform , the new Core M systems , which will start shipping in laptops and tablets , can achieve twice the processing performance of today 's leading tablets , said Navin Shenoy , Corporate Vice President and General Manager of Intel 's Mobility Client Platform , in a meeting ahead of Skylake 's unveil at IFA 2015 . Processing power is n't the only thing that gets revamped . Shenoy says that the new Core M comes with `` 40 % gen-on-gen graphics improvements , '' meaning that graphic performance will be 40 % better with Skylake than the current crop of Core M devices . Yet , despite a huge boost in performance , Intel is still committed to delivering all-day battery life with Skylake 's Core M , increasing battery life by an hour . Whereas the current Core M chips can deliver up to nine hours of battery life , Skylake 's Core M processors can do 10 hours of computing on a single charge . Core M also supports USB-C so you can use one connector for peripherals , display and charging . With the new M , Intel is segmenting the chip based on performance . The Intel Core M3 will be the base model , and Intel will also offer a Core M5 and Core M7 processor , with the M7 SKU offered on high performance , premium fanless tablets and notebooks . The new Skylake Core M processors will support Intel vPro technology for enterprise use . When asked if performance differences between various Core M Ultrabooks on the market today forced Intel to create separate models in the lineup , Kirk Skaugen , Senior VP and General Manager of Intel 's Client Computing Group , responded only by saying that the company was able to create enough distinction between the M3 , M5 and M7 processors to give the chips their own identity , similar to what Intel has done for the Core i3 , i5 and i7 processors . Because Core M systems use a fanless design , improving graphics performance was an important decision for Intel as these machines can not accommodate discrete GPUs . In highlighting some of the graphics power of Core M , Skaugen and his team showed that Core M can drive up to three displays at 4K UHD resolution playing videos at 60 frames per seecond using the integrated Intel HD 500 graphics . Intel is honing its focus on 2-in-1 convertible owners with its Core M processor design . In a study , Intel found that half of 2-in-1 owners had considered a tablet , but ultimately went with a 2-in-1 design for its versatility and productivity . Additionally , these buyers will refresh their hardware faster than traditional tablet owners . The market is also headed in this direction , Shenoy hinted as he flashed a few prototype 2-in-1 designs in a meeting ahead of IFA 2015 . In 2013 , there were only 25 2-in-1 devices , retailing for an average of $ 900 . Today , there are over 80 devices on the market utilizing this versatile form factor , and prices have dropped . The average price for a two-in-one is now $ 650 . The diversity of devices and affordability have spurred growth in adoption in this form factor , with a quadrupling of volume of devices shipped . Additionally , we 're also hearing rumors that Apple will adopt the new Core M3 and Core M5 processors in its next MacBook release .

At Dell World in Austin , Texas , Dell introduced the most significant refresh to its OptiPlex commercial PC portfolio in five years . Along with the unveiling of the Wyse 5050 AIO zero client with VMWare , Dell said that these systems will help address the needs of the connected workforce of the future . `` We are defining the future of the PC and the role it plays in meeting our customers ' most pressing computing needs , '' said Jeff Clarke , Vice Chairman of Operations and President of Client Solutions at Dell . `` We are investing in this part of our business like never before , bringing new innovations to market that are redefining the role of the PC – whether it 's an ultra-mobile 2-in-1 , thin or zero client , or a desktop that now handles workloads for a mobile workforce who require a robust collaboration solution . '' Dell unveiled a complete overhaul of the OptiPlex commercial PC family , addressing various desktop form factors . The refresh brings better energy efficiency to Micro Form Factor , Small Form Factor , Mini Tower and All-in-One designs , Dell said , which will help business users work faster , be more productive and better collaborate . With the performance improvements delivered with the upgrade to Intel 's latest sixth generation Skylake processors , the OptiPlex PCs deliver up to 160 % better performance than a PC from five years ago . And the OptiPlex AIO brings 300 % more pixels in the 7000 Series compared to a full HD ( 1080p ) display . The family of PCs can be configured with double the memory and four times the storage of prior generation products . Dell said that background noise is reduced by 32 % with the OptiPlex 7040 Small Form Factor . Additionally , for small meeting and conference spaces , the OptiPlex 7040 Micro with Intel vPro can be configured with Intel Unite software for seamless virtual meetings . `` The PC is core to our business , '' Michael Dell said at Dell World . `` We 've been working very closely with Microsoft on the launch of Windows 10 . '' On the consumer and SMB side , Mr. Dell said that the XPS 13 and XPS 15 with Windows 10 `` may be one of the best PCs ever made '' Dell said it has overgrown its competitors with share growth , experiencing 11 consecutive quarters of growth . This is aided by Dell services , like ProSupport and ProSupport Plus . To help businesses manage and deploy devices , Dell also announced ProDeploy . The new OptiPlex PCs will follow Dell 's 3000 , 5000 and 7000 numbering scheme found on other families of devices , including Latitude and Inspiron . There will be a number of different models in the OptiPlex commercial PC family . The OptiPlex 7040 is the most powerful device , offering enterprise-class manageability , security and expandability .

You likely wo n't see Intel 's infamous `` Intel Inside '' sticker plastered on the back of the iPhone 7 , but that does n't mean that future Apple smartphones wo n't contain Intel technology . Citing people close to the matter , VentureBeat reported that Intel has as many as 1,000 engineers working on a modem that could be used in a future iPhone . The Intel 7360 LTE modem , which supports 4G LTE and 3G CDMA networks , could arrive as early as the iPhone 7 , according to the publication . Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that the 7360 modem will start shipping to manufacturers by the end of this year and will show up in products ready for consumers in 2016 , which could result in Apple getting its iPhone 7 modems from both Qualcomm and Intel . Currently , all of the iPhone modems are sourced from Qualcomm . Although Apple wo n't be using Intel 's mobile-based Atom processor on an iPhone any time in the near future , the goal would be to integrate the modem directly onto Apple 's A-series processor in a system-on-a-chip ( SoC ) design . Integrating the modem , processor and graphics together onto a single silicon chip could lead to better battery life , improved performance and faster speeds for iPhone owners . For Apple , this could also lead to thinner iPhone designs . Integrating components also means that less space is required for each individual component , so Apple could shed thickness or pack in a bigger battery on its next iPhone model . Intel 's role in the equation would be manufacturing these chips . Apple would design the rumored A-series processor , license Intel 's intellectual property to integrate the modem directly into the processor design and then send the design to Intel 's fabrication labs to be manufactured . The A9 chips inside Apple 's flagship iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus smartphones are manufactured by TSMC and Samsung . Even though the A9 chip is a 14nm processor , Apple 's partners create the interface with a 20nm design , which is n't as efficient or advanced as Intel 's 14nm design . In addition to a 14nm design , Intel has begun work for an even smaller 10nm design , which could be ready in as little as two years . This puts Intel 's timeline ready for production for an A-series processor for the iPhone 8 , with the iPhone 7S likely succeeding next year 's iPhone 7 . Infineon , the wireless company that Intel acquired , had supplied 3G modems for Apple 's iPhone until 2011 . Apple has since switched to Qualcomm as its modem supplier . Since the acquisition , Apple has hired a number of top Infineon executives , including Intel CTO Bernd Adler . VentureBeat cites conflicting sources as to the reason for Apple 's hire . Some speculate that Apple hired Infineon engineers to help collaborate with Intel , while others suggest that Apple wants to design its modem in-house , similar to how it currently designs the A-series processors . In addition to mobile , Intel 's processors are also found on Apple 's OS X products . Apple transitioned from a PowerPC architecture to Intel 's x86 processor in 2006 . Now , Intel processors span all of Apple 's desktops and laptops , including the Mac Pro , Mac Mini , iMac , MacBook , MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lines .

Slumping PC sales and a beleaguered mobile strategy is now forcing Intel to look elsewhere for growth . As the company attempts to place its own silicon into devices beyond desktops , laptops and servers , it has picked up an executive from rival Qualcomm in an effort to reorganize its chip-making strategy . A day after Qualcomm co-President Murthy Renduchintala tendered his resignation from the firm 's ARM-based Snapdragon business , Intel announced that he would oversee Intel 's processor business . Renduchintala will serve as President of Intel 's PC processor and Internet of Things ( IoT ) divisions under the reorganization . `` Intel 's strategy and direction is solid , and we continue to evolve our organizational structure to better position the company for growth , '' Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement . `` The caliber of leadership and experience Murthy brings to our executive team represents a significant move toward delivering the benefits of our strategy even faster than before . '' Intel 's vision for connecting all the gadgets , peripherals and accessories to the internet was laid out earlier this year at IDF 2015 , when Krzanich showed off drones , robotic arachnids and 3D world-sensing cameras . The company showed off its vision for connected wearables , talked about smart diapers and smart car seats and showed off new bicycles with Intel sensors and IoT processors that can help better train athletes at performing tricks and stunts . News of Renduchintala 's appointment comes a day after Intel boldly predicted that tablets will lose out to two-in-one convertibles . Intel is bullish of the form factor , and the company recently partnered with Microsoft , Dell , HP and Lenovo on a series of advertising campaigns to highlight Intel 's sixth generation Skylake processor , Windows 10 and the appeal of convertibles . Despite a slump in PC sales , Intel expects hybrid sales to increase in 2016 . The company is optimistic about its data-center business and small business segments . As Intel expands its embedded processor business , small business owners may find new tools to optimize their operations and workflow . This could help pave the way for new sensors and technology to enter the workplace , making it more affordable for SMBs to monitor their operations . And with more sensors collecting more data , Intel hopes that this will translate to growth in its data center business , as businesses look to store , monitor and analyze collected information .
Intel 's Optane products will be available as soon as next year for enthusiast PC owners – meaning those with high-end rigs such as gamers who are prepared to fork out for blazing fast SSDs . This is according to Kirk Skaugen , senior VP and general manager of the Client Computing Group , who made the announcement at Intel 's investor conference yesterday , as PC World reports . If you not heard of Optane before , it 's essentially a supposedly revolutionary new memory category which promises super speedy SSDs and system memory . It was first unveiled earlier this year as 3D Xpoint ( Optane is the snappier brand name for Intel 's version of the tech ) . 3D Xpoint ( pronounced '3D crosspoint ' ) took Intel over a decade of research to hone , and boasts a transistor-less crosspoint architecture which is something like a three-dimensional chessboard , allowing for data to be read and written in small sizes far more quickly and efficiently . According to Intel , it represents the biggest memory breakthrough since NAND flash was introduced , and it 's a big , big deal with the company claiming it 's no less than 1000 times faster than NAND ( with 1000 times greater endurance , too ) . The first Optane products will be SSDs and memory DIMMs ( the latter being aimed at servers for data centre usage and the like ) . Naturally , the first SSDs to emerge next year will be expensive for early adopters , but eventually they will start to come down in price for a more mainstream positioning ( just as with solid-state drives when they first came out – now look how cheap they are ) . Of course , Optane wo n't simply be about enthusiast PCs and gaming rigs , but it will have a wide impact across many spheres of technology , including more efficiently crunching big data , machine learning and other heavyweight applications . Micron , which jointly developed 3D Xpoint with Intel , will also be bringing its own products to market in the future .

Tablets may be going the way of the dodo bird , at least that 's what Intel wants you to believe . With the release of Intel 's sixth generation Skylake processors this autumn , Intel is hoping that the new chips will drive consumers to choose two-in-one convertibles over tablets . Combined with partner Microsoft 's launch of the Windows 10 operating system , Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told investors at the company 's annual investor meeting that `` there 's not a reason you have to go to a tablet device . '' Krzanich appears confident that the power , performance and versatility that Skylake delivers with Windows 10 will make it an easy choice for consumers . Even though Apple 's iPad tablet remains a market leader , sales have declined . With growing demand for convertibles , Intel predicts that it will ship fewer processors for tablets . Last year , its chips were found on 40 million tablets . This year , the number may be closer to 30 million . Intel is n't the only one bullish on the convertible form factor . This summer , analysts from Gartner , IDC and Canalys predicted that even though tablet sales may be slowing down , there is a bright spot for growth with the two-in-one category . Even Microsoft 's Surface Book , which the company claims to be the best laptop ever made ounce for ounce , comes with a detachable screen that transforms it into a lightweight tablet in Clipboard mode . There are several hypotheses on why the two-in-one category is gaining momentum . First . Skylake will deliver more computing power while still being energy efficient for this mobile form factor . Second , tablet users may realize that this form factor , while great for consuming content , is n't quite suited for content production . And lastly , businesses may find this form factor appealing as they look to upgrade existing notebooks . Microsoft built in better support for convertibles into its Windows 10 operating system with a feature called Continuum , allowing users to adjust the user experience of the OS based on how they use the device . The growth of convertibles may be a bright spot for Intel as it continues to struggle against ARM with its mobile strategy . Unlike the desktop market , Intel 's chipsets are only found in a limited number of smartphones and tablets . If Intel 's prediction is correct , the shrinking tablet market and growing convertible market will help Intel reclaim mobile owners who may have previously chosen a tablet powered by ARM .
Samsung has just announced the development of S-RAM modules based on 10nm FinFET tech , meaning smaller SoCs with obvious benefits for smartphones . The news will be something of a wake-up call for Samsung 's rivals , because as ETnews reports , the development of 10-nanometre FinFET S-RAM means the company is ahead of not just TSMC , but also the chip giant Intel ( the latter has pushed its 10nm schedule back a year from 2016 to 2017 due to production costs ) . Samsung 's new S-RAM modules will be used for processor cache , and the new 10nm FinFET efforts are apparently 37.5 % smaller than 14nm S-RAM . We are talking better performance and lower power draw , which should hopefully mean some nice gains on the battery longevity front – which are always welcome . Samsung reckons that it will be ready for mass production of the 10nm memory modules by 2017 , and early on in the year for that matter . We 'll just have to wait and see if that target becomes a reality… Samsung is certainly pushing hard on chip development , and indeed in September , opened a new HQ in Silicon Valley to push forward with research and development in terms of semiconductors , as well as displays . At the opening of the new headquarters , Oh-Hyun Kwon , Vice Chairman and CEO of Samsung Electronics , noted that the firm is `` laying the groundwork for a more aggressive pace of growth over the next several decades . '' Hopefully that aggression will see rivals spurred on further , and greater progress being made across the whole industry . Via : G for Games

Intel has revealed four new NUCs ( Next Unit of Computing mini PCs ) on its website , and these devices are powered by the company 's new Skylake ( sixth-generation ) processors . Although strictly speaking , there are only two new models with two variations of each . First off we have the NUC6i5SY , which runs an Intel Core i5-6260U CPU ( dual-core , 1.8GHz with turbo up to 2.9GHz ) featuring integrated Iris Graphics 540 , with the variations being the NUC6i5SYK and NUC6i5SYH – the former just has room for an M.2 SSD , and the latter is larger with extra space for a 2.5-inch SATA drive . There 's also the NUC6i3SY sporting a lesser Core i3-6100U ( dual-core , 2.3GHz ) with Intel HD Graphics 520 , again with an identical choice of an SSD unit , or a larger box with space for a 2.5-inch drive . These new Skylake models can also take two sticks of DDR4 RAM up to a maximum of 32GB , and they offer Wi-Fi , a full-size HDMI port ( allowing for 4K resolution ) , mini DisplayPort , four USB 3 ports ( two on the front , two on the back ) , and an SDXC card slot . You also get 7.1 surround sound with the Core i5 machine if you 're intending to use this as a living room PC ( there 's also an infrared sensor on the front for remote control duties ) . And all this in a 4-inch square box ... Pricing has n't yet been announced and neither has the exact release date , but presumably these will be incoming pretty soon . Via : VR-Zone

Intel has revealed a number of new CPUs of the desktop and mobile variety , with both Skylake and Broadwell processors being added to the company 's official line-up . What 's interesting about these models – eight in total have been added to the firm 's roster – is that they have rather different model numbers , indicating that they will be an unusual or niche spin on Intel 's processor technology . For example , the two new desktop processors are the Intel Core i3-6098P and the i5-6402P . As CPU World reports , the ' P ' is likely to indicate that these are bereft of an integrated graphics solution ( at least this was the case previously when Intel used this suffix ) . The i3 model will be a dual-core CPU ( with four threads ) running at a base clock of 3.6GHz with 3MB cache , priced at $ 117 ( around £79 , AU $ 160 ) . As for the i5 offering , that will be a quad-core model running at 2.8GHz with 6MB cache , with pricing set at $ 182 ( around £122 , AU $ 250 ) . On the mobile front , Intel is also introducing the Celeron 3855U and 3955U , ultra-low voltage dual-core processors which sip power and run at a clock speed of 1.6GHz and 2GHz respectively , both being priced at $ 107 ( around £72 , AU $ 147 ) . And at the more expensive end of the mobile spectrum , there 's a pair of new Core i5 offerings ( 5200DU , 6198DU ) and a pair of i7 CPUs ( 5500DU and 6498DU ) . These are all dual-core chips running at from 2.2GHz to 2.5GHz , the price pitched at $ 281 ( around £199 , AU $ 385 ) for the former , and $ 393 ( around £265 , AU $ 540 ) for the latter i7 processors . As to what the 'D ' stands for in these model numbers , that 's not clear at this point . There has been quite a lot of excitement around Skylake 's overclocking potential , and indeed recently we 've seen that even non- ' K ' ( i.e . locked ) desktop processors can be ramped up with some serious overclocking . That means the good old days of buying a budget processor , sticking on a serious cooling solution and speeding it up massively are back – at least if you have a motherboard which has been updated with a workaround to get past Intel 's restrictions ( such as one from Asrock ) .

As you 're no doubt aware , for some considerable time now – since Sandy Bridge processors were introduced by Intel – overclocking has n't been possible ( or rather , any real overclocking has n't ) and CPUs have been locked at their default clock speed unless you pay a bit more for an unlocked ' K ' model ( and these were n't even made for the lower-end Core i3 offerings ) . There have been slight exceptions to this rule , like the Pentium G3258 anniversary edition , but everything has apparently changed with the newest Skylake processors from Intel , as not just the ' K ' models but also the standard CPUs from this range can be overclocked , Techspot reports . There has been plenty of previous speculation that major base clock overclocking could be possible with Skylake , and it was just a matter of motherboard vendors implementing workarounds to bypass the restrictions put in place by Intel . And this has happened in the case of Asrock , which has come up with a BIOS update that enables overclocking non- ' K ' CPUs on its Z170 motherboards – an update which will be rolled out soon enough , by all accounts . And Techspot has tested this out , managing to overclock a Core i3-6100 from its base speed of 3.7GHz to 4.7GHz – an impressive boost indeed , making for some equally impressive benchmarks . For example , the overclocked i3 outpaced a Core i5-4430 in Cinebench R15 in both single and multi-threaded tests . This is certainly exciting news for folks who like to buy a bargain processor , stick a fat cooler on top of it , and ramp it way up to get some real juicy performance numbers out of a relatively cheap piece of hardware . While Asrock is the first motherboard manufacturer to successfully implement this update , it doubtless wo n't be long before other major vendors follow suit with their mobos . Then overclocking enthusiasts just have to hope that Intel does n't attempt to block such workarounds . Further performance benefits will come to those running a Skylake CPU with Windows 10 thanks to Intel 's Speed Shift technology , although this will hardly make the same impact as a substantial overclock .

AMD 's long-awaited line of Zen processors will indeed be arriving for high-end PCs later next year , fans of the Intel alternative will doubtless be pleased to hear . It 's hoped that Zen CPUs will bring AMD back on a more competitive footing with Intel , and confirmation of the launch was reported by WCCF Tech , coming courtesy of AMD 's chief financial officer , Devinder Kumar ( a stalwart of the company who has worked there for over three decades ) . At the Raymond James Technology Investors Conference , Kumar said that AMD would introduce high-end desktop FX processors of the Zen variety next year . He noted : `` I think the key is getting through 2016 is to continue to stabilise the computing and graphics business , commercial , professional graphics embedded and even the high-end desktops with the Zen Core should all be accretive from a margin standpoint . '' Expectations for the processor are certainly high , and last month AMD insisted that during testing these CPUs have met all expectations . Zen boasts a high-performance core design , and Zen cores can apparently handle 40 % more instructions per clock than the current Excavator cores . Zen ( which will use the company 's AM4 platform ) is apparently nicely compact and efficient when it comes to power consumption too , and CPUs will come in four , six and eight-core flavours . They will also use a high bandwidth , low latency cache system . The big chunky FX desktop processors will be the first out of the door , and will eventually be followed by the likes of new APUs and cheaper offerings in general .

Intel has launched new sixth-generation Intel Core vPro processors which the company claims will transform business computing and boost user productivity considerably – not to mention making some important improvements on the security front . The new vPro line will nestle in a range of business devices running the usual gamut of desktop PCs , all-in-ones , Ultrabooks and 2-in-1s , and Intel claims major gains when compared to a five-year-old system . We are talking up to 2.5 times the system performance , triple the battery life , and a 30-fold increase in graphics performance when put head-to-head with a five-year-old machine in a range of benchmarks run by Intel ( including SYSmark and 3DMark ) . As for bolstered security , the company has introduced a measure called Intel Authenticate , a multifactor authentication solution . This offers three factors of verification – namely something you know ( like a personal ID number ) , something you have ( like a smartphone ) and something you are ( such as a fingerprint ) . In other words , to login you 'll need a password , a device , and biometric authentication . Intel Authenticate is compatible with Windows 7 and upwards . Tom Garrison , vice president and general manager for the Intel Business Client division , commented : `` By also adding enhanced security capabilities in the hardware , Intel has helped to make these newest PCs an integral part of a business 's overall security solution , making users more secure and productive than ever before . '' The vPro processors also incorporate Intel Unite for better workplace collaboration , offering easy display sharing over multiple screens ( local and remote ) . Finally , Intel Small Business Advantage ( or SBA ) is on board as a simple and centralised way in which small businesses can share data and collaborate , with automatic security and maintenance updates . It offers file sharing , chat , and security features too . Acer , Asus , Fujitsu , HP , Panasonic , Toshiba , Lenovo and Dell are all pushing out enterprise-ready hardware with the new CPU under the bonnet , according to Intel .

Intel 's NUC , or Next Unit of Computing , PC is getting a refresh that makes them even more powerful this year . Along with updated models of the Compute Stick , Intel refreshed its NUC PCs with the company 's sixth generation Skylake processor at CES 2016 . On the surface , not much has changed with Intel 's NUC PC . The small form factor desktops maintain a similar design as last year 's model and competes in the same space as Apple 's Mac Mini . However , on the inside , this year 's model comes with either a dual-core Intel Core i3-6100U or an i5-6260U processor . Not on display at CES in Las Vegas is a quad-core model that Intel said will also be coming sometime in the future . The quad-core model will also be able to support discrete external graphics cards . The quad-core model is codenamed Skull Canyon . Intel has n't shared many details about that model , except that it will support a Thunderbolt 3 port . The Thunderbolt 3 connectivity will be good news for gamers looking at a compact PC . Even though Skull Canyon wo n't ship with discrete graphics , likely topping out with Intel 's Iris , you 'll be able to add external graphics through the Thunderbolt 3 connection . This will allow Intel to target Skull Canyon at gamers and desktop users who need a compact workstation with discrete graphics . Intel will offer its NUC PCs in several different configurations . The base models with either the Core i3 and Core i5 processors will offer a low profile design with an array of ports for connectivity , including HDMI , Mini DisplayPort , four USB 3.0 ports , two internal USB 2.0 ports and infrared sensor . The desktops will also include 802.11ac Wi-Fi , Bluetooth and NFC support for wireless connectivity . For the dual-core NUC PC models , the Skylake processors will also give Intel 's new NUC PCs a graphics boost . These PCs will come with the Skylake-based integrated graphics . The Core i3 model will be powered by Intel HD 520 , while the Core i5 model will top out with the more powerful integratedIris graphics . For comparison , last year 's Broadwell-based NUC PCs shipped with the Intel HD 6000 graphics . Additionally , Intel will also make variants with a slightly taller profile . The extra space will be used to accommodate a 2.5-inch hard disk drive . Intel has n't shared pricing information about its NUC lineup at this time , but the company stated that the PCs will arrive in March .
Intel showed off a prototype of its Project Tango phone late last year at the Intel Developer Forum , and now the phone and its embedded RealSense 3D camera is available for purchase . Intel launched a pre-order campaign for the Android-powered phone on its webstore for $ 399 ( £273 , AU $ 570 ) . While consumers can get into the action , the phone is geared more towards developers , businesses and those who may need to capture 3D scans in a more portable form factor . For consumers , the phone can also be used for augmented and virtual reality gaming . In a demo last year , Intel showed that the phone can be paired with a Nerf gun , where players can fire real Nerf ammunition at virtual targets . Intel 's Project Tango phone comes with a rear-facing RealSense 3D ZR300 camera . Additionally , the phone features a two-megapixel front-facing camera and rear-facing eight-megapixel shooter . Intel 's 3D camera will open the phone up to new experiences , including indoor 3D mapping , VR gaming and 3D scanning , Intel said . Intel provided a few demos of how the phone can be used at IDF 2015 . The RealSense camera is capable of capturing 10 million points per second . Even though the phone runs Google 's Android operating system , it will not come with the standard ARM architecture processors . Instead , the brain behind Intel 's Project Tango phone is the Intel Atom x7-Z8700 Atom-based processor . In addition to the high-end Atom chip , the phone will ship with 64GB of storage and 2GB of memory . To match other flagship phones on the market today , Intel is also equipping the phone with a spacious 6-inch QHD ( 2560 x 1440 ) resolution display . The large screen will be useful for viewing 3D scans . Intel still has not provided an exact ship date for the phone , and pre-orders are limited to one device per customer .

Intel 's compact PC-on-a-stick form factor will get even faster this year . Unlike the first generation Intel Compute Stick , Intel debuted a pair of Compute Sticks with its new Core M series processors based on the company 's sixth generation Skylake chip architecture . While the Core M processor is n't as fast as the mainstream Core i series , it will offer a performance boost over the old model 's Bay Trail-based Atom processor introduced a year ago at CES . The first model comes with an Intel Core m3 processor and will be priced at $ 399 ( £272 , AU $ 564 ) . The more powerful Core m5 version will be priced at $ 499 ( £341 , AU $ 706 ) , and both versions will ship with Windows 10 . The devices will feature 802.11ac Wi-Fi connectivity , 64GB of storage , 4GB of memory and three USB ports for expansion . Intel has n't announced a shipping date for either Compute Stick versions . The Compute Stick is essentially a Windows 10 desktop that 's packed into the size of an HDMI dongle that 's not much bigger than a large USB flash drive . The benefit of the device is that it does n't take up any desktop space , and the solution is a convenient one for those looking on building a home theater PC ( HTPC ) . Essentially , plugging the HDMI connector into your existing HDTV will turn your existing television into a smart TV . Similarly , you can upcycle old displays and give it new life with this simple hardware add-on . The device is also easy to transport , allowing you to have a PC setup in a hotel room when you travel if you connect the Compute Stick to your television and add a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard . In addition to the more powerful and pricier Core M Compute Sticks , Intel also announced a version with an Atom x5 processor . This model will utilize the Atom Z8300 processor and will be equipped with 32GB of storage and 2GB of memory for $ 159 ( £108 , AU $ 225 ) . It will also come with 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support . Intel 's Compute Stick form factor is also adopted by other PC manufacturers , including Lenovo and Asus . Additionally , Asus also released a Chromebit , which utilizes the same form factor but swaps Windows 10 for Chrome OS .
Whether it 's autonomous drones or a Segway that can convert into a digital butler , Intel shows that it is n't afraid of a world where robots can sense , think and make decisions . Technologies must enable new experiences to be successful in the future , Intel CEO Brian Kraznich said in his keynote as he rode out onto the stage on a Segway-like `` self-balancing vehicle . '' `` We believe we are entering a new era of consumer technology , '' he said . `` Consumers are choosing experiences over products . '' Part of the experience that Intel is delivering is intelligence . Not only can the self-balancing vehicle balance itself with the embedded Intel Curie sensor , it can also convert into an intelligent , autonomous home butler . The robot , which will be available to developers in the second half of the year and consumers after that , can sense and navigate through the world , avoiding obstacles thanks to the depth-percepting Intel RealSense 3D cameras . After all the sensory information is captured , the robot can can process the data and make real-time decisions with Intel 's Skylake Core m7 processor . It 's not just robots that are getting smarter . Intel showcased an autonomous drone that can understand the world and fly on its own . With RealSense camera , the drone can navigate through a forest of trees to avoid obstacles . Everything today is defined by technology , but technology is not our focus , Krzanich said . The most important thing is that the technologies that Intel will show will be delivered by its partners `` in the next few months . '' This will be `` the year of amazing experiences , '' Krzanich said . Showcasing how technology can be used to create more personalized human experiences , Krzanich turned to gaming where RealSense cameras can be used to scan a player and inject them into the game . In a Fallout 4 demo , Krzanich 's team scanned his image , and instead of an avatar or generic image in the game , we see Krzanich 's image in the middle of the game . With sports , Intel says that it 's technology will revolutionize how we play , experience and watch sports . Through a partnership with BMX , Curie sensors are embedded onto bikes , which will sense the movement of a bike as the driver perform tricks and stunts . Utilizing Intel 's Curie and its sensor hub , Intel will be able to give athletes real-time feedback as they perform and train . Curie is sampling today , and Intel says will ship this quarter in volume at less than $ 10 ( £6 , AU $ 14 ) . Intel also announced that it is partnering with ESPN and X-Games to bring Curie to the Aspen games next month . For athletes , Intel is working with New Balance to bring a new smartwatch to the market . Intel 's previous partnerships in this space include Fossil and Tag Heuer . New Balance will also work with Intel to launch new wearables through its Digital Sports division . Similarly , Intel had worked with Oakley to develop an intelligent digital coach to help train athletes . The coach collects real-time sensor data and makes instant decisions on how to help motivate and push athletes , similar to a real coach . Radar Pace uses voice control and guidance to train an athlete . It will announce real-time information , such as pace and other stats to the athlete , and it will also use this information to help customize a workout to the athlete . In addition to consumer use , Intel shows that its technology can also be used in industrial settings . In a partnership with DAQRI , Intel showed a smart helmet that is now shipping . Like Microsoft 's HoloLens and Google Glass , DAQRI can show augmented reality information , and Intel says that this is suitable for workers in the field . In a demo , Intel showed a field worker performing a repair . DAQRI overlays augmented reality information to guide the worker in the repair process , and the helmet can even assist the worker with the ordering of parts at the end of the job . Intel shows that it 's ready to embrace a future of smarter , autonomous machines , but that this future has to be human and humane . Instead of announcing new goals this year , Krzanich addressed some of the goals that he brought up last year , and stated that Intel is well on its way to addressing some of the pressing problems it identified . For its commitment to diversity , Intel says that it will start publishing its diversity and inclusion report twice a year , and that embracing women and minorities is part of its business plan . Additionally , all Intel products shipping this year will contain conflict-free minerals . It has worked with its supply chain to help address the problems , rather than abandoning areas where problems occurred .

Intel has used MWC 2016 to announce four industry collaborations with mobile network providers and hardware manufacturers that will test the viability of 5G communications . The chipmaker is extending its current partnership with Ericsson to conduct new trials around network transformation , cloud and Internet of Things ( IoT ) . It is also collaborating with Ericsson 's archrival , Nokia , on pre-standard 5G radio technologies and network solutions to allow early implementation of 5G mobile client , wireless infrastructure . In another trial , it will work with SK telecom on new radio access technologies and joint solutions for Licensed Assisted Access ( LAA ) in unlicensed spectrum bands . Finally , Verizon and Intel are to conduct field trials for 5G wireless solutions through the Verizon 5G Technology Forum . They will demonstrate how millimetre wave spectrum can allow for fast wireless connections to homes and businesses . Intel also plans to team up with Korea Telecom to kick off joint trials in 2018 that will focus on the development and verification of 5G wireless technology and devices , virtual network platforms and joint standardisation efforts . Speaking to journalists , Aicha Evans , general manager of Intel 's Communications and Devices Group , said that infrastructure and mobile network providers have a part to play in helping 4G 's successor off the ground . She said : `` Communications are not going away , and we believe it 's our responsibility as an ecosystem to make the networks ready [ for 5G ] . It 's about getting together and making sure we 're developing trials , prototypes , and taking advantage of major events that are going to present an opportunity to demonstrate the tech . '' In contrast to 4G , which was mainly concerned with increasing speeds , Evans said that 5G will be focused on supporting `` more than 50 billion devices '' expected to connect to networks - from IoT devices to smart meters , robots and consumer technology - in the next few years . She said : `` When we look at 5G , it 's not just about a faster connection - it 's about getting everything in place so that when devices are coming onboard we 're ready , with all the major players pulling in the same direction . '' Evans added : `` We feel that we are living in a world that 's becoming increasingly smart and connected , and this is both in the consumer space as well as the enterprise . From self-driving cars to drones to robots , smart cities and agriculture , basically this is the next era . `` 5G networks and devices are essential to delivering on that promise , and we think they 're going to be absolutely necessary .

Intel has made a move to stop the overclocking of its standard ( i.e . not unlocked ' K ' model ) Skylake processors . News that such overclocking was possible first emerged last December , when Asrock revealed a new BIOS update that permitted it on the firm 's Z170 motherboards . This meant users could take a cheap Core i3 Skylake CPU and crank it right up with a big overclock ( just like back in the good old days ) . However , at the time it was thought likely that Intel would block this BIOS workaround , and indeed this has now happened . Intel told PC World that it 's priming a microcode update to put an end to this practice . The company also noted that performing such overclocking is n't a good idea , and indeed if you engage in juicing up your CPU like so , it will void your warranty as the processor is being pushed beyond its design spec . An Intel spokesman said : `` Intel regularly issues updates for our processors which our partners voluntarily incorporate into their BIOS . The latest update provided to partners includes , among other things , code that aligns with the position that we do not recommend overclocking processors that have not been designed to do so . Additionally , Intel does not warranty the operation of the processor beyond its specifications . '' In other words , if you want to overclock , Intel is insisting that you should pay the premium for a ' K ' unlocked CPU , which has been the case since Sandy Bridge was first introduced . Of course , if you 've already overclocked your Skylake processor in this way , you could always choose not to update to the new firmware that tackles this issue , whenever it 's rolled out .

Intel may be about to switch sides in the graphics world to hook up with AMD as part of a new licensing agreement . The chipmaker currently has a five-year deal with AMD 's archrival Nvidia that comes to a close at the end of 2017 . Worth $ 1.5 billion ( around £1 billion or AU $ 2 billion ) , it has never seen any of Nvidia 's tech make it into Intel 's integrated solutions . Whispers from the rumour mill indicate that Intel is currently involved in talks with AMD , attempting to forge a new deal . According to a private Bloomberg report obtained by Barron 's , signing on the dotted line would be a huge boon for AMD . The company could see a considerable – and much needed – pile of cash pouring into its coffers . So if this comes off , does that mean we could see an Intel chip with integrated AMD graphics ? That is a possibility , but of course Intel 's own integrated solutions ( Iris ) are far from shabby these days . Or , rather less excitingly , the agreement could just be about acquiring defensive patent ammunition , which could be very necessary once Intel 's deal with Nvidia expires , if the latter decides to go to war with litigation again . AMD is certainly pushing forward hard and innovating in the graphics arena of late , what with the release of XConnect tech recently , which makes it easy to hook up an external GPU to your Windows 10 laptop ( via Thunderbolt 3 – interestingly enough , this system was co-developed with Intel as well as Razer ) . And in terms of VR gaming , AMD has unveiled the Sulon Q , a wireless virtual reality headset with integrated computer , plus the company is sending its dual-GPU Radeon Pro Duo video cards out to developers at universities in an effort to spark the creation of VR content across the globe .

If you want a mini-PC , then obviously you have to make sacrifices in terms of power to get that compact form factor . But those sacrifices are gradually becoming less painful to bear , and Intel has taken another major step in this respect with its latest NUC . The new 'Skull Canyon ' NUC is admittedly bigger in stature than previous offerings from Intel , but you 're effectively getting a low-end gaming PC crammed into the 8.5 x 4.6 x 0.9-inch enclosure . The engine is a Core i7-6770HQ processor running at 2.6GHz ( featuring Turbo to 3.5 GHz ) with Iris Pro 580 graphics , and there 's room for up to 32GB of RAM , along with two M.2 slots so you can fit a pair of SSDs inside , no less . Connectivity is impressive too , and you get four USB 3.0 ports , along with a Thunderbolt 3 port , full-size HDMI 2.0 and a mini DisplayPort 1.2 . There 's also an SD card slot and an Ethernet port , plus on the wireless front the NUC offers 802.11ac Wi-Fi along with Bluetooth 4.2 . There 's also a rather nifty looking skull logo on the outer casing – and a plain black lid with no logo that you can replace it with if you think the skull is naff rather than nifty . One interesting thing to note is that because this machine has Thunderbolt 3 on board , it 's possible to hook up an external graphics enclosure like the Razer Core and further boost this NUC 's gaming chops . Mind you , that would be an expensive proposition given that this Skull Canyon mini-PC is n't cheap to begin with . Shipping is set to kick-off next month and the suggested retail price for the NUC6i7KYK kit is $ 650 ( around £450 , or AU $ 850 ) . Intel states that a typical build with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD with Windows 10 will run to around $ 999 ( around £690 , or AU $ 1,300 ) . That price will likely put a lot of folks off given the sort of desktop gaming PC you can get for this money , but you 're obviously going to pay a premium for a small machine with a considerable amount of relative power . In a way , it 's not about the actual NUC itself , but the direction these compact computers are heading in . Hopefully it wo n't be too long before we see mini-PCs with some true power start to hit more tempting price levels .

Intel has no plans to build a virtual reality ( VR ) headset , and definitely no designs on selling one to consumers . Kim Pallister , Director , VR Center of Excellence at Intel , revealed this to techradar at an event at GDC 2016 held to discuss Intel 's VR strategy . `` No , we do n't have plans to build a headset , '' he told us point blank . Pallister explained Intel works closely with a number of partners in the space , including HTC , Oculus and Razer , as well as companies that are developing VR in regions like China . `` We 're pretty satisfied working on the base platform that powers that stuff , helping them do whatever they need to do , '' Pallister said . Recent reports indicated Intel was building a headset that would use the company 's RealSense 3D camera technology for an augmented reality experience . Rather than position it as a product for consumers , Intel was said to target the rumored headset at manufacturers to demonstrate what 's possible with its parts . Intel has a long history of building hardware to show other companies what can be done with its components , without ever bringing the tech to market . Pallister said Intel is already looking to second- and third-generation VR and focusing on solving problems the current gen is facing , such as reducing - or removing - wires and bringing users ' hands into the experience using RealSense . `` RealSense is a powerful asset that we have for our clients , '' he said . `` When you look at the whole idea of putting a camera in or on the head mounted display , there 's some obvious things . I can keep you from bumping into the coffee table , or I can bring your hands into the simulation . '' He continued : `` It 's not clear that people are going to want to get rid of the controller , but [ let 's ] have it be more intuitive : if I pick up my cell phone , that should be in the simulation . We 're excited about the openness that people have and allowing experimentation . Someone at a hackathon or indie game jam or wherever will come up with a new way of using [ RealSense ] , and then we 'll see it take off as a result. `` At tonight 's event , Pallister did leave the door open for Intel to , one day , tinker with a headset to help other manufacturers improve virtual reality for all . `` Maybe we could take a hacker kit and experiment with stuff to show what 's possible , '' he said . `` But we 're not going to bring a product to market .

While just about every company under the sun is pushing ahead with virtual reality technology , Intel is reportedly looking to develop its own augmented reality headset . Intel is said to want to leverage its depth-perceiving RealSense 3D technology for the wearable , according to the Wall Street Journal , which could make it a much more powerful AR headset than we 've seen so far . That 's because the company 's RealSense 3D technology , as it has been used so far by Intel , can measure depth as well as read gestures . Using its depth perception to better map a person 's real-world environment in an AR setting could unlock a number of possibilities , making it easier to move around a room without having to worry about needing a clear space . A person 's couch or desk could also become part of the experience . Some AR experiences , like those for Mattel 's AR/VR ViewMaster , require a person to look at a specific spot within the experience to make a selection . Using RealSense , a user could potentially reach out themselves and make a hand gesture to make a selection instead . This is similar to what 's been developed by Microsoft for the HoloLens . But while Intel plans on developing the design of the AR headset with RealSense 3D tech , the report suggests that the chip-maker would pitch it to other manufacturers to actually make the headset . This would n't be too much of a surprise , as the company partnered with start-up IonVR to build a smartphone-based VR headset that also uses RealSense . It would likely hope to develop a similar partnership for an AR wearable . The IonVR headset was shown off during CES 2016 , where the chipmaker also showed off how RealSense 3D tech can be used in smartphones , Segways , drones and video games .

The PC market is in bad shape and even Intel is beginning its exit strategy with plans to fire 12,000 employees as part of a bold restructuring . The processor maker announced its plans to lay-off 11 % of its global workforce by 2017 in a bid to refocus its efforts in internet of things technology and the connected computing space . In the corporation 's first quarter earnings , the company revealed the IoT segment lead to a $ 2.2 billion increase in Intel 's revenue . Connected computing not only helped Intel turn a profit last year , it 's also beginning to become the majority of what Intel works in . The corporation also revealed IoT technologies makes up 40 % of the company 's entire revenue pool as it attempts to offset the decline in the PC market segment . Intel has steadily diversifying itself and last year it introduced new chipsets embedded in smartwatches like the Tag Heuer Connected and Fossil 's first Android wearables . Intel is likely not to drop out of the PC game but the company plans to evolve , shifting from a solely `` PC [ -oriented ] company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart , connected computing devices . '' While this is a smart move for Intel at large , our thoughts are with those affected .

Intel has revealed some blazingly fast new SSDs , including models which are the first drives to utilise its 3D NAND technology . Those 3D NAND-toting beasts are the DC P3520 and P3320 series of solid-state drives . The P3320 will be offered in 2.5-inch ( pictured ) and PCIe card flavours , and it 's optimised for cost-effective performance , with Intel claiming it delivers no less than five times the performance of a mainstream SATA SSD , with 3.2 times faster sequential reads . This drive , which will be available in capacities from 450GB up to 2TB , is designed for the enterprise – think cloud and data crunching applications – but it shows the sort of speed which is in the pipeline for consumers in the future . The P3520 is a similar offering but with further performance and latency boosts for high-performance cloud operations . Intel also unveiled the DC D3700 and D3600 range which the company notes are its first dual-port PCIe SSDs , connecting to two host systems simultaneously for redundancy if ( or when ) things go wrong . As for SSDs which will be plonked into Ultrabooks – or indeed desktop PCs – Intel also recently revealed the new 540s series which offers a combo of SLC cache and TLC NAND for what the company calls a good compromise between performance and value for money . These drives will be available in both 2.5-inch and M.2 form factors with capacities ranging from 120GB to 1TB . The base 2.5-inch 120GB model will offer sequential read speeds of up to 560MB/s and write speeds of up to 480MB/s . Intel is also producing the Pro 5400s range of high-performance SSDs aimed at businesses , again with capacities from 120GB to 1TB , boasting improved security including support for Trusted Computing Group 's Opal 2.0 protocol and Microsoft eDrive hardware encryption . And of course , further down the line we 've got Intel 's Optane SSDs to look forward to , with models aimed at enthusiast PC builders set to emerge at the beginning of next year .

Intel has unveiled its new Xeon E3-1500 v5 range of Skylake-based processors which are designed to be a cost-effective solution for streaming video and other graphics-heavy applications . As the company notes , video now accounts for something like 80 % of all internet traffic , and service providers can make use of the new Xeon CPUs – which carry integrated Iris Pro Graphics P580 – rather than going to the expense of a discrete graphics card solution . Intel boasts that the new Xeon E3-1500 v5 range offers up to 26 % more 'overall graphics performance ' than the previous generation ( E3-1200 v4 ) in terms of remote application delivery for the likes of complex CAD apps in virtualised environments . And when it comes to heavy duty media processing in the cloud , it 's capable of delivering up to 18 AVC streams or eight HEVC streams at 30 fps full HD , or going up to 4K resolution , it can achieve two HEVC streams at 30 fps . Also note that the CPUs paired with Intel 's C236 series chipset can be hooked up with faster memory , supporting up to 64GB of DDR4 running at 2133 MHz . There are five SKUs in the Xeon E3-1500 v5 family , three of them pitched at data centre usage ( being optimised for performance ) and two aimed at media processing ( optimised for reliability ) . The E3-1585 v5 is the top-end data centre offering with a clock speed of 3.5GHz and turbo up to 3.9GHz with a TDP of 65W . For media processing duties , the top dog is the E3-1578L v5 with a clock speed of 2GHz and turbo up to 3.4GHz , with a TDP of 45W . The company further notes that the range offers Intel Graphics Virtualization Technologies ( GVT ) which allows for the sharing of a CPU 's resources between designers or engineers with the inclusion of a new option on this front : GVT -g. This lets up to 7 different users share the resources of a single processor simultaneously ( alongside GVT -s , which supports a large number of users across common apps such as Office ) . Intel observed : `` The increased graphics capabilities offered by the Intel Xeon E3-1500 v5 family enable complex , 3D applications to be delivered remotely to multiple end devices from secure public and private cloud data centres – unleashing the professional 'creator ' and enabling greater collaboration among the global workforce .

The Broadwell-E Intel Core i7-6950X is arguably the world 's most powerful processor ever created . It 's the first processor from Intel to come packing 10-cores . What 's more , they 're all running at a base clock of 3GHz or up to 3.5Ghz thanks to Intel 's new TurboBoost 3.0 technology . You can bet this Broadwell-E part will absolutely decimate CPU in existence before it . According to Intel 's numbers , its new Broadwell-E Core i7-6950X processor offers a 35 % increase in performance compared to the last generation Haswell-based Intel Core i7-5960X . The this is largely thanks to the part 's new 14-nanometer Tri-Gate 3D transistors . But beyond the silicon , Intel has introduced TurboBoost Max 3.0 technology to more efficiently push each Core as far as they can go . Currently , Intel 's processors are limited to working as fast as the slowest core . However , with TurboBoost Max 3.0 lets you push every thread and core to its limit . The new chip will still fit in X99 motherboards as it 's using LGA 2011-v3 socket . Intel 's latest extreme processor also features 40 lanes of PCIe 3.0 connected directly to the CPU , which allows you to load up your ultimate rig with quad-SLI or crossfire and still have room to add speedy SSDs . And with 20-threads and quad-channel DDR4 2,400MHz memory , it brute forces its way through content creation and gaming with a new form of multi-tasking Intel calls mega-tasking . Instead of having to wait for video to finish rendering before you can do anything else , Intel claims its latest product will relieve all production hang ups . Alternatively , users could game at 4K , record their gameplay and push the same footage to a livestream all at once . The Intel Core i7-6950X processor will begin shipping in the coming weeks with a starting price of $ 1,569 ( about £1,071 , AU $ 2,177 ) . Beyond introducing a new flagship product , Intel is expanding its series of Skylake processors with more cores . Finally supplanting the Intel Core i706700K is the hexa-core 3.4GHz Intel Core i7-6800K , followed by the 3.6GHz Core i7-6850K featuring the same number of cores and lastly the octo-core 3.2Ghz Intel Core i7-6900K . Users will see performance increases from the added cores as more games are developed with DirectX 12 .

It 's not been easy for Intel to catch up with the big hitter Qualcomm in the mobile chip market but there 's some light at the end of the tunnel , if a Bloomberg report is to be believed - apparently Intel 's modems will be used in the iPhone 7 for phones sold on AT & T in the US and some international versions . Qualcomm , the current incumbent , will pick up the slack on Verizon and in other parts of the world , particularly China . While it 's not great news for Qualcomm , the company wo n't be panicking yet , and the move was to some extent expected : we heard very similar rumours last October . Note that we 're talking modem chips here , which connect your smartphone to a cellular network and control radio communications - we 're not referring to the processors in the new iPhones , a job Apple usually farms out to TSMC and Samsung . It 's possible Intel could eventually take over here , too . While you probably wo n't give much thought to who made the modem chip as you amble down to the Apple Store to pick up your iPhone 7 , it shows signs of hope for Intel in the smartphone market and indicates that Apple is willing to diversify in choosing hardware partners to help build its flagship handsets . Further down the line it could lead to cheaper iPhones if Apple manages to play manufacturers off each other in terms of price . It 's estimated that Qualcomm gets around $ 15 for every iPhone Apple sells - about $ 3.47 billion last year , then . As for the really juicy iPhone 7 rumours , there are plenty of those too . The handset , due in September , is said to be adding a camera lens , dropping the headphone jack , adding waterproofing and dropping the bezels . Aside from that , expect something that looks very similar to the iPhone 6S . Our review of the latest iPhone , the iPhone SE : Via PhoneArena

Intel has unleashed its new Xeon E7-8800 and E7-4800 v4 range of processors which offer what the company claims is remarkable performance improvements over predecessors , with CPUs boasting up to 24-cores . The Xeon E7-8890 v4 is the high-end 24-core effort ( running at 2.2GHz with 60MB of last-level cache ) , and it offers 1.3 times faster performance than the previous generation when put through the paces of key industry benchmarks . Like the other processors in the family , it will support 3TB of memory per socket , so in an eight-socket system you 'll be able to have a whopping 24TB of memory . These processors are designed for heavy duty applications in the enterprise , analytics and data crunching on a massive scale , and that impressive memory capacity means large datasets can be stored directly in memory rather than on drives , allowing for much faster results . Intel further asserts that the E7 v4 range is capable of up to 1.4 times higher performance than IBM Power8-based offerings ( and up to 10 times better performance for the dollar , no less ) . Obviously performance is n't the only concern , and Intel has made advances on the reliability and security fronts too . The company says the new processors have over 70 RAS ( reliability , availability and serviceability ) features and improved error recovery mechanisms , and new security features that allow for the encryption of data at a much faster speed . In fact , the CPUs offer up to 70 % more encryption performance per core , so keeping your data secure is much less of a drain on system resources . In a press statement , Intel noted the importance of data crunching and analytics these days : `` The key opportunity is turning the massive amount of core business data plus new sources of unstructured data into actionable and timely insights . In fact , research is finding that companies that use data-driven insights are two times more likely to have top quartile financial performance and five times more likely to make decisions faster than their competition . '' In short , it 's a data-driven world out there , and Intel 's new processors will help companies make sense of all their data in a much more efficient and timely fashion .

Intel 's Optane SSDs – which utilize 3D Xpoint tech and promise to be screamingly fast – will be with us before the year is out . Yes , Optane drives will ship before the end of 2016 according to comments made by Brian Krzanich , chief executive of Intel . Indeed , as PC World reports , some of the SSDs have already been sent out to testers ( mainly major cloud players ) . All this is in line with the schedule Intel set out last autumn , when it said that the SSDs would be available to enthusiast PC owners at some point during 2016 . 3D Xpoint technology is expected to deliver super-speedy drives and also system memory , although the latter in particular will be aimed more at servers and data centers . The Optane SSDs , however , are not just for servers and are also aimed at enthusiast PC owners and gamers – albeit those with fat wallets who can afford a drive , as the early models will doubtless be pretty damn expensive . Krzanich even talked gaming briefly , noting that the drives could revolutionize level loading times : `` You can pre-load in a cache-like environment the next level of your game so it loads almost instantly . '' 3D Xpoint has previously been billed as the biggest memory breakthrough since NAND flash was introduced , and indeed Intel has said it 's 1000 times faster than NAND , and it took over a decade of research to develop . It boasts a transistor-less crosspoint ( Xpoint ) architecture which is somewhat akin to a three-dimensional chessboard , and this means that data can be read and written in small sizes at far faster speeds .

Is Intel about to bring six-core CPUs into its mainstream processor offerings ? Apparently so , although you 'll have to wait till the year after next for them to arrive . Yes , according to a leaked slide , Intel is bringing forth Coffee Lake ( yet another 'lake ' – and a particularly tasty sounding one ) in 2018 , and this will be based on a 14nm process and offer six-core beasts as well as the usual dual and quad flavors . Previously , Intel has pushed out six-core CPUs , but only in the form of enthusiast models with wallet-damaging price tags . Obviously , mainstream offerings would be far more accessibly priced . It 's also worth noting that we were led to believe Kaby Lake processors – which have just started shipping to device manufacturers – were to be the last outing on 14nm , with Intel 's new scheme of three releases ( Broadwell , refinement to Skylake , final hurrah with Kaby Lake ) . But it seems that Coffee Lake will be the final , even further refined , take . Cannonlake ( which you may previously have heard referred to as Skymont ) will be the first step down to 10nm and is still expected to kick off next year . ZDNet , which spotted these developments , also noted that Intel will have Skylake-X processors coming out in Q3 next year , and these will be the usual high-end exorbitantly priced offerings which come in six-core , along with eight and 10-core varieties . One last thing worth noting with all these new chip families is that from Kaby Lake onwards , you 'll need to be running Windows 10 in order to be able to use the CPUs . They wo n't be compatible with older versions of Windows , so if you 're thinking of a processor upgrade in the future , that 's certainly something to bear in mind . In other words , if you do n't pull the trigger for a free Windows 10 upgrade now – before the deadline which is set at the end of this month – you may end up paying for it later . Meanwhile , AMD 's Zen 14nm processors are expected to be unleashed in the final quarter of this year , and are expected to initially be offered in up to eight-core versions , hopefully bringing some more intense competition for Intel .
Apple and its iPhone 7 may have just put the `` fab '' in fabrication news for TSMC , the Taiwanese iPhone chip maker that previously split manufacturing duties with Samsung . It 'll be the sole provider of the Apple A10 System-on-a-Chip , believed to be the next processor at the heart of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7S , reports 9to5Mac , citing The Electronic Times . TSMC is n't exactly new to this . It took charge of manufacturing the Apple A8 chip , which went into iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014 , and the new Apple TV this past year . The iPad Air 2 featured the Apple designed A8X made by TSMC and , most recently , the iPad Pro was bumped up to its blazingly fast Apple 9X successor . But Samsung has had its hands in every single other iPhone and iPad processor , from the first iPhone to the the most recent iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus . This is a big blow to Samsung because while its smartphone division has struggled in recent months , it still saw an increase in profits from making the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus chips . Apple has long been looking to push Samsung out of the picture . After all , it 's not only the top iPhone challenger , it 's been locked in a bitter court battle with Samsung since 2011 . All hope is not lost for Samsung 's phone processor manufacturing business . It 's said to be helping Qualcomm mass produce the new Snapdragon 820 chip . That speedy System-on-a-Chip is rumored to be at the center of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , both of which are expected to be unveiled on February 21 .

Following Intel 's official unveiling of its new Kaby Lake ( seventh-generation ) processors , and a rash of incoming notebooks set to use the CPUs , Microsoft has confirmed what it announced earlier this year – that only Windows 10 will support this new processor . And it 's not just Kaby Lake either , but all future processors such as rival AMD 's incoming Zen . Back at the start of the year , Microsoft said that : `` Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform on Intel 's upcoming 'Kaby Lake ' silicon , Qualcomm 's upcoming '8996 ' silicon , and AMD 's upcoming 'Bristol Ridge ' silicon . '' When PC World asked Microsoft to confirm that this was still the case , a company spokeswoman replied : `` As new silicon generations are introduced , they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support . '' `` This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon , while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon , '' she added , restating what Terry Myerson said at the beginning of this year . Both Intel and AMD representatives who were contacted also confirmed that the policy was in place for future processors like Kaby Lake and Zen . AMD said its CPU roadmap was `` fully aligned with Microsoft 's software strategy '' , and Intel clarified : `` No , Intel will not be updating Win 7/8 drivers for 7th Gen Intel Core [ Kaby Lake ] per Microsoft 's support policy change . '' So it 's most definitely Windows 10 or bust if you want your PC to have a cutting-edge CPU . However , you may recall that Microsoft did have a rethink on withdrawing extended support for those running Skylake ( sixth-generation ) processors with Windows 7/8.1 ( meaning only critical security patches would be provided ) . Originally , Microsoft was looking to cajole those on Skylake hardware to move to Windows 10 by ceasing extended support for Windows 7/8.1 in July 2017 , but following much complaining , that deadline was first pushed back to July 2018 – and then earlier this month things changed again with full support for Skylake being extended to end-of-life ( January 2020 for Windows 7 , and January 2023 for Windows 8.1 ) .

Intel 's 7th generation processors have been officially announced and the chipmaker predicts they could help create even thinner laptops . Skylake CPUs have already led us to ultra-thin machines like the 10.4mm HP Spectre , however , Intel claims with 7th gen ( codenamed Kaby Lake ) processors , we 'll start seeing 10mm thick 2-in-1 laptops and even slimmer traditional clamshell notebooks . This is all possible thanks to an improved 14nm+ architecture with a thinner fin profile and a more robust transistor channels . As a result , we 'll see more efficient chips that only use between 4- to 15-watts to start . Beyond helping to produce smaller devices , the improved architecture has also led to a 12 % process performance increase and 19 % better web performance . The double digit performance increases are impressive , but Kaby Lake processors are also focused on improving 4K video and gaming as well . 7th gen CPUs integrate a new media engine built on a Gen9 graphics architecture , which will allow users to edit 4K video in real time and render an hour of footage in just 12 minutes . Combined with a new VP9 and HEVC 10-bit decode and users should be able to stream 4K video with 'all day battery life ' ( 9.5 hours ) . On the gaming front , Intel also demonstrated a 15W chip with integrated graphics is capable of playing Overwatch in Full HD 1080p at roughly 32 frames per second . Intel is kicking off its new 7th gen series with a family of six processors . This includes three processors from the U-series destined for Ultrabooks and slim notebooks , while another trio of Y-series chips will power laptops with a convertible or fanless design . In another shake up , the chip maker is phasing out parts of the Core M-series processor tree . Intel Core m5 and m7 processors have been subsumed into the Core I-series family , while Core m3 will remain as one of the company 's most power efficient parts . Intel projects we will see more than 100 new laptop models sporting this initial lineup of Kaby Lake processors . But this is only the beginning . In January , Intel will also launch more lines including V-Pro chips to power enterprise and workstation machines , desktop SKUs compatible with the 6th generation socket , Iris graphics-equipped components for gaming , as well as H and HK class parts for enthusiast level rigs .

Notebook manufacturers producing machines powered by Apollo Lake CPUs are turning to soldered-on system memory in a bid to make these laptops as svelte as possible . Of course , this quest for thin devices comes with an obvious drawback – you wo n't be able to switch out the RAM and upgrade to more memory . Whatever system RAM you purchase the notebook with , that 's what you 'll be stuck with for the lifespan of the device . This news comes from DigiTimes and the tech site 's usual sources in the supply chain , who say that broadly speaking , most laptop vendors have ditched DIMMs in favour of on-board memory to ensure their Apollo Lake machines are nice and slim . Obviously , that 's good news in terms of portability . But consumers and businesses alike will just have to hope they can select a model which has enough memory to cater for their needs going forward into the foreseeable future . Apollo Lake ( based on 14nm Goldmont ) is a power-sipping processor that follows on from Intel 's Cherry Trail CPUs and is targeted at lower-end and wallet-friendly notebooks . In other words , they 're perfect for consumers and businesses who just want a portable that will do the basics , and most certainly wo n't break the bank . DigiTimes mentions that we should see a couple of new ultra-thin Apollo Lake models from Acer at IFA which kicks off next week – Aspire devices , both of them less than 17mm thin – and other major brands including Dell , HP , Lenovo and Asus will have similar super-svelte offerings coming out before the year end . It 'll certainly be interesting to see how they shape up in terms of aesthetics and performance , and the asking price – not to mention the battery and longevity , which hopefully wo n't suffer at the hands of the laptop shrink ray ( though Apollo Lake 's efficiency will obviously help in this regard ) .

Intel already has all giddy about the prospect of new seventh generation processor-powered laptops coming later this fall and now AMD says it 's also on track to deliver desktop-grade Zen processors by next year too . Literally a block away from the IDF 2016 conference , AMD unveiled the first official details of its next generation processor . Zen is built on a 14nm FinFET architecture that 's not only smaller , but also more power efficient while delivering 40 % better performance . Beyond the core architecture , Zen also introduces a new cache hierarchy , improved branch prediction , and simultaneous multithreading . Altogether these changes make AMD processors ready to tackle a broader range of applications from powering your everyday hybrid laptop to data centers and high-performance computing . AMD expects Zen will launch first on desktops utilizing the AM4 socket , which will be compatible with motherboards designed for seventh generation A-series CPUs . The new socket will support DDR4 memory , PCIe 3.0 , 10GBps USB 3.1 gen 2.0 , NVMe and SATA express Codenamed Summit Ridge , AMD showed off an octo-core , 16-threaded desktop processor designed to compete with Intel 's Core i7-6900K Broadwell-E CPU . Both chips were pitted in a Blender benchmark test and Zen CPU the finished rendering a half-second faster – that said , AMD had the Intel processor clocked down from 3.2Ghz meet its part its part at 3GHz . Additionally , there was a 32-core , 64-thread Zen-based server processor codenamed Naples . AMD 's plans on shipping its first desktop systems featuring 7th generation AMD A-series processor to its OEM partners towards the latter half of this year . However , it 's likely that we wo n't see Summit Ridge hit the desktop market in the first half of 2017 and Zen powered laptops even later than that .

These days , everyone 's making a virtual or augmented reality headset . Microsoft is making the HoloLens . Google pioneered cheap virtual reality headsets with Cardboard and will soon release an Android-powered VR platform called Project Daydream . Facebook owns Oculus , the makers of the Rift . HTC and Steam partnered to release the Vive . Sony is releasing PlayStation VR for its PS4 game system on October 13 . Razer has already released the OSVR HDK 2 , and AMD is collaborating on an Oculus Rift rival of its own with a company called Sulon Technologies . Heck , even 170-year-old lens maker Carl Zeiss is getting in on the action . My point here , obviously , is that the virtual and augmented reality headset market is a crowded space . But that competition did n't stop Intel , world-leading producer of CPUs , from jumping headfirst into the fray with its brand-new platform , Project Alloy . The headset was announced by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the Intel Developer Forum held in San Francisco and while there 's some very obvious comparisons to the half-dozen other headsets on the market already , Project Alloy has some very key differences : it 's completely tetherless , does n't need any external sensors and it will be powered by a 6th Gen Intel Core processor . Krzanich called it a merged reality headset – a headset that can switch in-between augmented reality and virtual reality putting you into a virtual environment surrounded by real , physical items . Krzanich joked that with merged reality you could experience all the joys virtual reality had to offer without the pain that true , all-immersive VR brings – e.g . no more bumping into walls , putting your hand through the TV and falling off the stage during a presentation because you could n't see what 's in front of you . Taken at face value , Alloy looks like it 's a smart take on a crowded genre , but when will it come out and what , exactly , can you expect to use it for ? Krzanich had few staunch details to share . We know that Intel is aiming for the second half of 2017 for a release date , and that it 'd like to get units into developer 's hands by December of this year , but there 's been no word on how much it 'd cost or what developers have already signed on board . Then there 's also the elephant in the room to consider – Microsoft 's own AR/VR platform , HoloLens , that in many ways looks significantly better than Project Alloy despite being announced over a year ago that could kill Intel 's latest tech before it ever takes off . While we may not know everything about it just yet , here 's what we know about Intel 's vision for merged reality so far . Project Alloy , aesthetically speaking , seems like a cross between Sony 's PlayStation VR and Samsung 's Gear VR – it 's mostly covered in pristine white plastic minus the back headband that packs a battery and tightening screw . It 's an easy comparison to draw to the Gear VR – not only are the colors the same , but there looks like there 's a lightness about the headset … not that Intel is letting anyone try one on this early in the game . But while it might look more like a fusion of Samsung and Sony 's wearables , it will function – primarily – more like Microsoft 's HoloLens . Take a look at the front face of the device . You 'll notice three sets of cameras . One of these is an infrared sensor that will be able to tell whether something is hot and cold ( perfect for knowing whether there 's a person or just a person-shaped piece of cardboard in front of you ) . The other set is a pair of fisheye lenses that will be able to see to the sides of your peripheral vision . And the final set is a pair of specially made Intel RealSense sensors that will be able to track depth and distance . If you 've come to be an expert in the field of virtual reality over the course of the last few months since the Rift 's launch , you might notice that Project Alloy does n't have any tracking dots or divots . That 's because the headset has enough data to know exactly where it is and what orientation it 's in – or at least that 's what Intel says . The other noticeable difference – well , besides the lack of a wire running to a PC – is that Project Alloy does n't use any sort of controller . Now , that does n't mean you wo n't be able to select options once you 're inside the semi-virtual world . On the right side are two buttons , C1 and C2 , which will likely act like the A and B buttons on a controller . It works well … sort of . Saying that Project Alloy works well in its current state requires a bit of qualification . First off , there 's almost no one – except Krzanich himself – who can say what it 's like to use Project Alloy . Intel is keeping most of the details on it , as well as development kits themselves , close to its chest at the moment . That said , as a virtual reality helmet everything looks fine . Even without the massive processing power of GPU to run the show , Alloy seemed to create a convincing reality while Krzanich was on stage . In the live feed shown to the audience there was almost no detectable tearing or troubling low polygon count . It looked close – if not identical – to the Oculus Rift . Well it did until Krzanich came too close to the headset . Then all hell broke loose . Because it 's an merged reality headset , Alloy pulls in objects from the real world . This would be neat if the camera could recognize an object – like , say , your hands – and created a one-to-one digital representation of them in your virtual space . It ca n't . What Alloy can do is pull in the live feed of your hands from the real world and put them into your virtual world , graininess and all . The final product looked as frightening and as experience-breaking as you 'd expect . Now , that might change once more developers get their hands on it – Intel is partnering up with Microsoft to optimize Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy – but that 's no guarantee that augmented reality products will ever look natural in virtual reality . Intel is n't afraid to break new ground . It 's crushed processor sales for years , and is now looking for new ways to partner with content creators . Project Alloy , like Intel Joule and any of the RealSense camera technology , is just one more way for Intel to get its products into the world and into the next-generation of heavily commoditized products . And while it might feel to some like another entry in a crowded genre rather than something completely and utterly jaw-dropping , Project Alloy has potential . When Microsoft and Intel work together , the two usually achieve more than either could on its own . If the two can sit down and develop a set of standards for all Windows-based headsets to follow , content developers will surely jump on board . If it ca n't , well , there 's a small chance that Alloy might become vaporware by this time next year .

You like power , right ? So do we , and today Intel let us in on just how powerful its 7th generation Kaby Lake processors are going to be . The chip maker revealed during its IDF 2016 developer conference that devices housing the Kaby Lake CPUs are so robust , you can play Overwatch without the need for a GPU . CEO Brian Krzanich hopped on a laptop housing Kaby Lake and proceeded to play the popular multiplayer , which only released in May . CPUs could power game graphics in the past , but never really something so recent , making this a huge step forward for graphics processing on chips . While Kaby Lake is a 14nm processor , just like the current-generation Skylake processors , it will have some notable upgrades . Those include fully integrated support for USB-C Gen 2 , native HDCP 2.2 support , and , potentially , integrated GPUs better-suited to 4K video . Kaby Lake devices should start arriving this fall , so stay tuned for more on when you can get in on Intel 's next generation of powerful processors .
Wireless headsets are the future of virtual reality , but so far only a few companies are even attempting create one . Now Intel is one of those few to experiment with such a device called Project Alloy . Announced at the Intel Developer Forum , Project Alloy is an all-in-one VR headset equipped with Intel 's system-on-a-chip technology , batteries and everything else it needs to create a self-contained virtual reality world . On top of simply exploring virtual spaces , Project Alloy is outfitted with two RealSense cameras that can analyze the world around you and bring real life objects into your digital experience . On stage Intel demonstrated how the mixed reality setup will allow users to avoid colliding into objects while interacting with physical objects in the real world . What 's more , Project Alloy supports Windows Holographic 's 3D and 2D mixed reality apps , so there should be no shortage of experiences in the near future . Intel plans to release the first version of Project Alloy to developers by December 2016 and the mixed reality headset will be available as open source hardware by the second half of 2017 . Real Sense APIs will be opened up as well .

Choosing between a Core or a Xeon processor is not as easy as one would think especially when there are literally hundreds of versions to choose from thanks to Intel convoluted strategy . Sure , you are usually tied to what you want to do in the first place but it is not clear cut , especially as the introduction of new , cheaper Xeon processors has made it more attractive to gamers . For the sake of simplicity , we 're not going to cover laptops or embedded models , focusing instead on the desktop and server models from the latest generation . 1 . The price Xeon processors tend to be more expensive than core ones with a few notable exceptions though . The lower-speed Xeon E3 are as affordable as some Core i5 processors which make them attractive options for some niche markets ( for example mobile workstations ) . Serious gamers might baulk at them because Xeon processors tend not to be very overclockable . But here 's the kicker : there is a massive second-hand market for Xeon processors , especially on eBay , which are far cheaper than the equivalent Core models . 2 . The motherboard Xeon motherboards are usually more expensive than their core counterparts . This is particularly true if you are looking for dual-socket models that take only Xeon CPUs ( E5 and above ) and can support more than 128GB memory . There are exceptions though as we 've seen a few models from Asrock and Gigabyte costing far less than £50 but only compatible with E3-1200 v3 series . 3 . The graphics Historically , Xeon processors have n't put a lot of emphasis on integrated graphics . That 's because as server or workstation CPUs , they 're expected to rely on external video resources . As such , only the low end Xeon CPUs have processor graphics , the P530 or the Iris Pro P580 . Compared to their Core cousins , these graphics parts are certified by some ISV ( independent software vendors ) which means that they have some serious firepower if you plan to do serious content creation . 4 . The memory support All Xeon E3 series and almost all Core CPUs support up to 64GB . Skylake-based Core i7 Extreme Edition models go up to 128GB and the rest of the Xeon family supports more than 1TB of memory . Gaming wo n't require that much memory as the bottlenecks are likely to be graphics or CPU-based . But anything else , content creation , simulation , number crunching and so on , will benefit from as much RAM as possible . 5 . The clock speed Speed is probably one of the least valuable metrics especially since Intel introduced Turbo Boost which allows the CPU clock speed to dynamically change depending on the workload . Clock speed and Turbo boost is usually tied to power dissipation ; the lower the thermal power dissipation ( TDP ) , the lower the clock speed . Higher TDP models usually tend to have higher turbo boost capabilities . 6 . The amount of cache Cache is a tiny amount of memory placed directly on the processor die itself . The more the merrier although its impact on performance will very much depend on the tasks being executed . All Core processors come with 8MB cache or less ; Extreme edition models can carry up to 25MB while Xeon E7 CPUs top 60MB . 7 . The core count When Intel found out , about 11 years ago , that just increasing the processor speed would n't bring much performance improvement , they decided to increase the number of cores instead , increasing that over time to four cores for the Core family ( 10 for the extreme edition ) and 24 for the Xeon family . More cores allow for more work to be performed at the same time although this depends on the applications being used . 8 . Hyper-threading Beyond an increased number of core , one other differentiation Intel put in place was Hyper-threading ( HT ) which can be best described as the ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time on the same core . One core usually can accommodate one thread but on some higher end models , that doubles to two . In theory , that increases performance – since one physical core spawned two virtual cores but like multi-core , it depends on what applications you use . All Core i7 and Xeon processors ( bar the E3-1225 v5 and 1220 v5 ) have HT enabled by default . 9 . The power dissipation All Core CPUs bar the Extreme edition have TDP below 100W while Xeon CPU go up to 165W . In general , the average power dissipation of the Xeon family is higher than that of Core . That allows the latter to overclock more easily , especially when provided with adequate ( and ample ) cooling solutions . It will depend on your needs and your budget . In the UK , the E3-1230 v5 ( 4C/8T , 8MB cache , 3.4GHz ) costs far less than a fourth generation Core i7 CPU ( 4C/8T , 8MB cache , 3.5GHz ) . And generally , you should be able to get more cores for your money if you go the Xeon way . Two Xeon E5 with eight cores each and a motherboard should cost you far less than a 10-core Core i7 CPU on its own . Xeon processors therefore makes sense if you 're building a new system , not so much if you 're upgrading from an existing one or planning to overclock your system from the onset . Then there 's the curious case of refurbished , recycled or re-used Xeon processors that are apparently what professional `` Youtubers '' are raving about .

Intel is working on a camera accessory for the HTC Vive that could help map out your surroundings . Although the Vive already features a `` Chaperone '' mode that shows a fuzzy representation of objects around you , the Intel camera would show users a video feed instead . The prototype camera was revealed on Twitter by Dimitri Diakopoulus , an Intel Prototyping Engineer . Diakopoulus told Upload VR the camera system is capable of tracking hand movements as well as IR-tracked controllers . The system can also scan a user 's environment in real-time , allowing the Vive to warn you when you 're about to trip over a chair or step on your cat . This real-time environment mapping will be handy for blending VR with the real environment , so you can pick up a glass of water , for example , without taking the Vive off . Diakopoulus did n't say whether the camera system could allow for any augmented or `` mixed reality '' features on the HTC Vive . For that , you 'll have to shell out $ 3,000 for the developer version of the Microsoft HoloLens . We expect to learn more about Intel 's camera system for the HTC Vive either this week at the VRLA expo or on August 16 during the Intel Developer Forum . Stay tuned as details roll in .

Intel is selling off a majority stake in its security division – formerly McAfee – to private investment firm TPG . Essentially , Intel 's security arm will be spun off into an independent company , which will once again be known as McAfee , and TPG will own 51 % of the firm , with Intel keeping hold of the remaining 49 % . The deal will see Intel receive $ 3.1 billion ( around £2.3 billion , AU $ 4 billion ) in cash , with the transaction valuing the business at $ 4.2 billion ( around £3.2 billion , AU $ 5.5 billion ) – including debt – and with TPG pledging $ 1.1 billion ( around £825 million , AU $ 1.4 billion ) worth of investment going forward to drive the new company to fresh heights ( or that 's certainly the plan , anyway ) . As ever , this is subject to the usual regulatory scrutiny , but if all goes well the deal is expected to close in Q2 of next year . Chris Young , currently Senior Vice President and General Manager , Intel Security Group , will be the CEO of the new McAfee , and he noted that he `` could n't be more energised about our future and how this transaction moves us forward '' . He commented : `` We will continue to focus on solving the unique demands of customers in the dynamic cybersecurity marketplace , drive innovation that anticipates future market needs , and continue to grow through our strategic priorities . '' Intel stated that the company 's security platform currently protects some 250 million endpoints and detects over 400,000 new threats daily . In the first half of 2016 , Intel Security saw revenue increase to $ 1.1 billion ( around £825 million , AU $ 1.4 billion ) which represented a growth of 11 % compared to last year .

Although high-powered Intel 7th generation are n't due until next year , that is n't stopping Razer for updating its gaming Ultrabook , the Blade Stealth . Now equipped with a new 7th generation Intel Core i7 processor , the new Razer Blade Stealth should be an even more capable machine for everyday life and gaming . Power aside , the gaming Ultrabook has also been upgraded with double the memory , bumping it up to 16GB of DDR3 RAM and a 1TB PCIe SSD . Battery life has also seen an improvement thanks to a larger 53.6 watt-hour battery – 15 % percent larger than the 2015 model 's 45WHr cells – which should afford users with nine hours of usage . The Razer Blade Stealth starts $ 999 ( about £760 , AU $ 1,325 ) with a QHD ( 2,560 x 1,440 display ) , 7th gen Intel Core i7-7500U processor with Intel HD Graphics 620 , 128GB SSD and 8GB of RAM . New models begin shipping today and the gaming Ultrabook will also be available at retail stores like Amazon and the Microsoft Store later this month . Razer is also updating its bigger Razer Blade gaming laptop with Nvidia 's latest Pascal graphics . The 14-inch notebook is now armed with the new Nvidia GTX 1060 . At first this might sound like step down from the Nvidia GTX 970 from last generation , but the new graphics chip is actually three times faster while delivering 40 % more performance . The new Razer Blade will stick with 6th generation Intel Core i7 processors until gaming-grade Kaby Lake processor are out . However , you still get a boatload of power , plus this rig is upgradable to 16GB of DDR4 RAM and an 1TB SDD . Razer is also bringing back the 1080p screen for gamers who want faster frame rates and a matte screen with minimal glare . The Razer Blade is available for pre-order starting at $ 1,799 ( about £1,370 , AU $ 2,390 ) and units begin shipping later this October .

Intel has revealed that there will be a considerable delay in the arrival of 3D XPoint memory , and the blazingly fast modules apparently won ’ t pitch up until late 2018 at the earliest . This news comes courtesy of The Motley Fool , which reports that in Intel ’ s latest earnings call , CEO Brian Krzanich said that : “ There will be a second generation of Purley that includes 3D XPoint . ” In other words , 3D XPoint memory modules will arrive with Cannonlake-EP processors , so it ’ s unlikely to be here before late 2018 or more likely , the first half of 2019 . So it ’ s at least two years away , or possibly even closer to a three year wait . Note that this is 3D XPoint memory we are talking about here , and not Intel ’ s Optane superfast 3D XPoint SSDs which are still expected to pitch up before the end of 2016 as far as we ’ re aware ( aimed at enthusiast PC owners and gamers who want lightning level loads ) . 3D XPoint is a transistor-less crosspoint ( XPoint ) architecture which it took Intel over a decade to develop , and the company claims it ’ s no less than 1,000 times faster than NAND flash ( it will also have massively more endurance than your typical SSD , i.e . a far greater lifespan ) . So you can see why folks are so keen for its arrival . Hopefully the delay in the arrival of the memory doesn ’ t foreshadow a hiccup with Optane and these SSDs sliding into 2017 . But as ever with the tech industry , that ’ s always a possibility . 3D XPoint memory is squarely aimed at server and heavyweight usage as opposed to having an enthusiast slant like Optane , but even so , development in the tech will doubtless eventually trickle down to provide benefits beyond data centres and big business applications . But not any time soon given this news , that ’ s for sure . Via : Hexus

News has emerged of a worrying flaw in Intel ’ s processors which can be leveraged to bypass a major security feature that the majority of mainstream operating systems use ( including Windows , macOS and Linux ) . The security feature we ’ re talking about in this hardware-sabotages-software scenario is ASLR or Address Space Layout Randomisation , a memory protection measure that aims to defend against the likes of stack overflow attacks and other memory corruption nastiness . Essentially , it aims to foil such exploits by randomising the address space locations of pieces of code , so an attacker can ’ t pin them down – and will probably cause a crash in any attempt to do so . And obviously the targeted application or OS crashing is a far more preferable result to having the system cracked open and left at the mercy of the attacker . The bad news is that as Ars Technica reports , a professor in the Computing Science and Engineering department at the University of California at Riverside , Nael Abu-Ghazaleh , has worked with colleagues and found a way to bypass ASLR using an exploit in an Intel Haswell processor . In a paper detailing their findings , the researchers wrote : “ We demonstrated a successful attack on a system with Haswell CPU and a recent version of Linux kernel . We showed that our attack is robust and can bypass KASLR [ Kernel Address Space Layout Randomisation ] in a very short amount time . ” The flaw itself is in the processor ’ s branch predictor , with the researchers leveraging a side-channel in the branch target buffer which allowed them to successfully pin down where sections of code would be loaded , nullifying ASLR ’ s randomisation . There are other ways to bypass ASLR , but this one is particularly effective compared to alternatives , and thus more than mildly concerning . Intel has been alerted to the findings , and the company is apparently evaluating the research . The good news is that according to the professor and his colleagues , there are several possible remedies on both the software and hardware fronts . We ’ ll just have to wait for further feedback from Intel to see what can be done in terms of keeping ASLR solid .

Self-driving cars are poised to take over our roads , and Intel does n't want to be left in the dust . For starters , the tech giant announced today a new group within its business dedicated to autonomous driving , called the Automated Driving Group , or ADG . The group 's sole purpose is `` innovating the future of driving and designing the next generation of advanced driver assist systems and autonomous driving solutions , '' according to Intel . ADG 's formation comes after Intel announced earlier this month that it plans to invest more than $ 250 million over the next two years in autonomous driving , in case you had any question how serious it is about all this . Intel vet Doug Davis will lead the ADG , while Kathy Winter , formerly a VP at Delphi , comes on as VP and general manager of the Automated Solutions Division . Her resume also includes partaking in the first autonomous vehicle cross-country drive . Intel is n't stopping with a new group and strategic investments : it 's also teaming up with Delphi and Mobileye to supply chips for an autonomous driving system . The system will start off with Core i7 silicon , an Intel spokesperson confirmed to The New York Times , but eventually move on to more powerful chips that will be announced soon . Intel 's spirited stance on self-driving cars is a savvy move as more chip makers join the autonomous vehicle fracas . In fact , Intel is really playing catch up . Rival Nvidia , for one , is a long-time proponent of self-driving cars , and recently unveiled a tiny supercomputer to power them . Qualcomm , meanwhile , is n't shying away from the sector , either . Intel likely wo n't develop its own car à la Google , but rather focus on creating smart chips , sensors and other components that will literally help drive autonomous vehicles forward . Who knows , in the not-so-distant future , you may be strolling through a car lot , trying to decide whether you should buy a self-driving ride with Intel inside . Wo n't that be a trip ?

Intel has created a quadcopter drone designed just to entertain crowds with beautiful choreographed light shows . Called Shooting Star , the drone can be programmed to fly as part of a swarm which is able to be controlled by just one pilot from a single computer . Intel says that using its Shooting Star drone will allow lightshows that might once have taken weeks to be created in “ a matter of days ” thanks to its companion software and animation interface . Rather than animators manually calculating where and when each drone has to be in order to create a particular image , Intel has created algorithms which are able to automate the animation creation process . These algorithms take an image , calculate the number of drones needed , determine where they should be placed and formulate the fastest path they can take to create the image . With built-in LED lights that are able to create over 4 billion color combinations , it ’ s safe to say animators will have the freedom to get creative , just as long as they don ’ t want to create a show longer than the drone 's twenty minute battery life . To keep things orgainsed , the software is able to check the status of each drone in a fleet and prioritise the use of those with the greatest battery life and GPS reception . Of course , safety has to be considered with drones that are designed to be used in close proximity to the public - we all saw what happened to Enrique Iglesias . To prevent damage to the drone or people in the event of an accident , Intel has constructed the Shooting Star with a soft , light frame made of flexible plastics and foam , and has encased its propellers in cages . Intel hasn ’ t revealed a price point for the Shooting Star , or whether it will be made available to the public , so you ’ ll have to sit on those plans for a magnificent Holiday light show for now . Considering Intel had to get FAA approval to fly its drones in a 500 strong swarm in order to break a Guinness World Record recently , it ’ s unlikely that we ’ ll see Shooting Star light shows outside of professional events any time soon . This is a big achievement for Intel in the area of drone fleet control , showing that large numbers of drones can perform complex tasks in unison under the control of only one person . Such technology could be useful to a variety of industries , not just entertainment , and could even prove useful in transporting large items or assisting in search and rescue missions . You can see Intel 's Guinness World Record setting Shooting Star light show in action below :

Qualcomm has announced the Centriq 2400 , noting that it ’ s the first server CPU in the world to be built on a 10nm process , and one that could be a worry for Intel and indeed AMD , particularly given other recent developments in terms of Qualcomm hooking up with Microsoft over Windows and ARM . At any rate , this new processor is designed for speedy performance in the data centre , and the Centriq 2400 is built around a custom ARMv8 CPU core ( called Falkor ) optimised for server workloads , offering up to 48 cores . As well as delivering on the performance front – and outdoing the dominant force in server chips , Intel , by racking up a far bigger core count , and of course reaching 10nm first – Qualcomm also promises impressive power efficiency , which is naturally a must for the data centre environment . The company said that Falkor has been designed from the get-go to be SBSA ( Server Base System Architecture ) compliant , meaning software which runs on any ARMv8 server platform will run on a Centriq 2400-based server . Qualcomm said that the new chip meant it was “ uniquely positioned to address the needs of cloud customers seeking new server solutions optimised for total cost of ownership , while meeting performance , efficiency and power demands ” . And the company has already demonstrated Apache Spark and Hadoop on Linux and Java running on the processor . Qualcomm says that the chip is currently sampling to key customers and will be commercially available in the second half of next year . As we already mentioned , Qualcomm has also been in the limelight due to the emergence of news of a big partnership with Microsoft , which means that desktop Windows 10 will be coming to ARM in the form of Qualcomm ’ s Snapdragon CPUs . Hence we can look forward to a new class of ‘ mobile PCs ’ going forward , and given the progress Qualcomm is making these days – and looking at the innovation on board these new server processors , for example – there are likely to be some furrowed brows at the offices of the big desktop chip makers .

From powering Samsung ’ s first-ever gaming laptops to Asus ’ VR-ready mini PC , Nvidia and Intel have proven to be the dynamic duo of CES 2017 . That said , they ’ re not without their fair share of competition . As history has proven time and time again , never doubt the underdog ; slowly but surely , AMD is catching up . Moreso in concept than in practice , AMD is beginning to make its two competitors sweat not only in low-end budget graphics and processors , but in performance-intensive areas like gaming and video production as well . Early benchmarks of AMD ’ s Ryzen CPUs , for instance , demonstrate power exceeding that of even the Core i7-6800K . All three of these companies , however , have managed to step up their game at this year ’ s Consumer Electronics Show . Not only are they all donning new hardware , but some existing technologies are now being implemented in new ways . Click ( or tap ) on ahead to find out what we mean . It ’ s not everyday that you see companies introducing new Android TV devices . As of this writing , there are only a handful – such as select Sony Bravia TVs and the Razer Forge TV , to choose from . The second-generation Nvidia Shield console is the latest addition to Google ’ s paltry catalog of Android TV-powered hardware . Coupled with the company ’ s answer to Siri and Alexa , Google Assistant , the new Nvidia Shield improves upon its predecessor with 4K HDR ( or High Dynamic Range ) streaming of both games and video . This is a unique selling point for Nvidia ’ s set-top box , which is only bettered by a more ubiquitous and portable GeForce Now streaming service . Assuming you have a properly outfitted PC , complete with a supported Nvidia graphics card , the Shield streamlines the process of streaming games from your PC to your TV in Ultra HD resolutions with HDR ticked on . The overhauled GeForce Now is compatible with games across your entire Steam catalog rather than just those deemed adequate by Nvidia . Starting in March , you ’ ll be able to use it on virtually any PC – desktop or laptop – for $ 25 ( around $ 20 ) per 10 or 20 hours of play , depending on your graphical demands . The 2017 Shield TV , on the other hand , is expected to arrive later this month starting at $ 199 ( about £189 , $ 272 ) . Although it looks like Kaby Lake isn ’ t all it was cracked up to be , Intel ’ s newest microarchitecture comes with a handful of non-performance-based improvements that make it tempting to upgrade . One of the more exciting innovations brought forth by Intel ’ s 7th-generation processors is called Optane , a technology that makes it possible for traditional hard drives to keep up with SSDs in terms of speed . It ’ s a bold claim , but if true , Intel Optane could put an end to the sluggish load times of an HDD without compromising on capacity . With that in mind , Intel Optane does require that the chip maker ’ s Iris Plus graphics be integrated into your CPU . Otherwise , your computer ’ s hard drive won ’ t be able to take advantage of the much-needed boost . Intel says that by eliminating delays , the hard drive is able to respond much more swiftly than before . Any processor Core i3 or greater is supported by the technology , so long as it meets the aforementioned prerequisite of donning Iris Plus . There ’ s no denying that team red has struggled these past few years with finding an audience outside of budget gamers . By and large , those who crave the most powerful CPUs often veer towards Intel while those in need of the highest resolutions and frame rates in their games are satisfied with Nvidia ’ s offerings . AMD anticipates that all of this will change with the debut of Vega , the company ’ s forthcoming GPU architecture designed for high-end gaming as well as demanding software applications . Rather than following in the footsteps of Nvidia and opting for GDDR5 memory , AMD is iterating on the high-bandwidth memory ( HBM ) found in the likes of the R9 Fury X . Appropriately dubbed HBM2 , AMD ’ s next generation of graphics cards will feature double the original ’ s bandwidth per pin and eight times the capacity per stack at the very least . Vega ’ s take on HBM2 also promises a smaller footprint and 512TB of virtual address space while the cache controller is said to offer ‘ adaptive fine-grained movement ’ . Alternatively , if this all sounds like nonsense , FreeSync 2 will soon be coming to a monitor near you , HDR support and all . In 2016 , Nvidia struck a chord with budget gamers when the company unveiled the GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti for the first time . Up until now , these affordable GPUs were limited to desktops only , with laptops getting only the GTX 1060 , 1070 , and 1080 . At long last , Nvidia claims you can “ play modern and classic games at 1080p @ 60 FPS ” on your laptop and save some money all the same . Boasting triple the performance of their predecessors , the GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti are capable of entertaining the screen tear-deterrent G-Sync , the in-game photography darling Nvidia Ansel and even the power-saving Nvidia BatteryBoost . With all of Nvidia ’ s key features intact , it ’ s clear the company is chasing after lost customers who may have fled to AMD but long for the software benefits that only Nvidia bears . The laptops to support these budget-friendly cards will touch down sooner than expected as well , with the first round slated for the first quarter of the year . These particular notebooks will come from Alienware , MSI , Asus and Dell , starting at the enticing cost of $ 699 ( £570 , AU $ 970 ) . Last but not least , Intel ’ s business-focused , seventh-gen Kaby Lake processors are rapidly approaching as well . Intel stopped at nothing to ensure that its enterprise lineup this time around covered just about everything . The least power-draining of them all is the vPro Y-series of CPUs , which are intended to for use in conjunction with 2-in-1 , or hybrid , laptops . These range from the 1GHz m3-7Y30 dual-core chipset with Intel HD Graphics 615 all the way up to the Core i7-7Y75 , which Turbo Boosts all the way to 3.4GHz . There ’ s a lot to see in this category , and it gets pretty intense as we reach the top-end Core i7-7600U sporting up to 3.9GHz in Turbo speeds . You would be mistaken to believe that Intel ’ s vPro processors stop there , however . In addition to a wide range of 2-in-1 picks , there ’ s also an entire lineup of workstation processors coming your way . For laptops , the quad-core E3-1505M v6 ships with a base clock of 3GHz and Turbo speeds up to 3.6GHz with Intel HD Graphics P630 while the E3-1535M v6 takes it up a notch 3.1GHz and Turbo to 3.9GHz . All of these come with improved battery lives over the previous Skylake architecture and luckily , there ’ s security built directly onto the chips , too , so there ’ s no need to fret about exploitation hazards .
Intel ’ s latest invention is a tiny computer about the size of a credit card , and the idea is it can be plugged into connected devices like smart TVs or fridges ( or indeed smart kiosks ) to provide an easily upgradable brain for the gadget . The Intel Compute Card , announced during CES 2017 , has all of the components you ’ d expect in a full PC , including a SoC ( system-on-a-chip ) , memory , storage , plus wireless connectivity . Smart devices and IoT gadgets will be built with a slot designed to take the Compute Card , and if the user wants to add smart capabilities , they can simply purchase the most appropriate card for their needs – there will be different models offering varying levels of performance . And of course this is an easy way to upgrade your smart device in the future . When more powerful Compute Cards are made , if you want to upgrade , say , your smart TV , it ’ s simply a matter of buying a new card and plugging it in . We ’ ve seen similar plug-and-play upgrades for smart TVs in the past from the actual manufacturers , of course , but this is a solution that aims to be universal across the smart home – or at least with those hardware makers who partner up with Intel to offer a Compute Card slot , of course . Intel says it ’ s already working with hardware partners including Dell , HP , Lenovo , Sharp , InFocus and a number of others . The first Compute Card will be launched around the middle of this year , although Intel didn ’ t say anything about the exact specs it will come with , save that Kaby Lake processors will be in the mix .

Over at CES , MSI has unleashed a new generation of refreshed “ true gaming ” notebooks which boast Intel ’ s newest Kaby Lake processors and Nvidia ’ s GTX 1050 ( and 1050 Ti ) graphics to better drive VR gaming ( and of course traditional titles , too ) . There ’ s a whole range of refreshed models , including the ( deep breath ) top-end GT83VR – which gets an RGB keyboard – plus the GT73VR , GT72VR , GT62VR , along with the GS73VR , GS63VR , GS43VR , and the GE72VR , GE62VR , plus the GP62VR , GP72VR , GP62MVR , GP72/GP62 , and finally the GL72/GL62 . All of these notebooks will come packing up to Core i7 Kaby Lake ( seventh-generation ) HQ-series CPUs which MSI estimates will provide a 15 % ( non-overclocked ) to 25 % ( overclocked ) performance boost over the previous Skylake CPUs . On the graphics front , MSI is introducing Nvidia ’ s GTX 1050 and GTX 1050 Ti with its new line-up . Compared to the last-gen GTX 960M , you can expect 15 % better performance with the 1050 Ti , according to the company . As well as Kaby Lake and Pascal hardware helping to give smoother performance levels in VR games , MSI has also improved matters on the sonic front with the world ’ s first virtual reality sound enhancement courtesy of Nahimic VR with 7.1 surround – although this will only come on selected models . A further audio boon is the inclusion of ESS Sabre HiFi audio DAC to ensure you get the best quality output to your gaming headphones . The GT83VR series boasts a 32bit/384KHz sampling rate , with the GT73VR , GS73VR , GS63VR and GS43VR series offering a 24bit/192KHz rate . It ’ s not all about the graphics , after all . MSI further boasts that it has implemented highly efficient cooling for these machines to ensure they won ’ t overheat while being driven hard by demanding games .

Intel has added to its seventh-generation Kaby Lake and Xeon processor lineup with fresh models , boasting vPro technology and aimed at mobile workstations , unveiled at CES 2017 . As you would expect , there are CPUs catering for a variety of performance and power efficiency demands , with the most frugal power-sipping model being the 4.5W Intel Core vPro Y-series processors which are targeted at 2-in-1 detachables . The m3-7Y30 is a dual-core processor with a base clock of 1GHz with Turbo up to 2.4GHz , with integrated Intel HD Graphics 615 . Move on up to the top-end Core i7-7Y75 and you ’ re looking at a base clock of 1.3GHz with Turbo to 3.4GHz . The 15W and 28W Intel Core vPro U-series are aimed at convertible laptops along with thin and light notebooks , with the more heavyweight 45W H-series Core vPro destined for large-screen/premium notebooks . The dual-core Core i3-7100U ( 15W ) has a base clock of 2.4GHz with Intel HD Graphics 620 , and the range steps up to the Core i7-7600U with a base clock of 2.8GHz and Turbo to 3.9GHz ( and the same integrated graphics ) . There are also models with Intel Iris Plus Graphics , offering far tastier performance for integrated graphics – we talk more about this here . The new CPUs with Iris Plus also sport Optane memory support which gives a traditional spinning hard disk a massive boost when it comes to loading times . Then there ’ s Intel ’ s new 45W Xeon processors , which give real grunt to mobile workstations . The E3-1505M v6 is a quad-core ( 8-thread ) CPU with a base clock of 3GHz and Turbo to 3.6GHz with Intel HD Graphics P630 , and the E3-1535M v6 steps the clock speed up to 3.1GHz with Turbo to 3.9GHz . The company also revealed 65W S-series Core vPro CPUs for mainstream tower PCs , alongside 35W and 65W Core and Core vPro S-series models pitched at mini PCs and all-in-ones , plus 65W/95W Core processors for enthusiast towers . Better battery life than Skylake is , of course , promised , with the new Core U-series offering up to 10 hours of battery life on the move according to Intel , and the vPro CPUs offer a number of boons on the security front built directly into the chips . These include Intel Authenticate , which the company describes as a ‘ robust ’ multi-factor authentication solution , protected directly on the hardware to lessen the chances of users becoming victims to the various scammers who are increasingly prevalent these days . Intel Software Guard Extensions ( SGX ) and Intel Online Connect technology is also on board to make online shopping a more secure affair , allowing for biometric verification for purchases made online . There ’ s also built-in two-factor authentication for Dropbox and other commonly used online services .
Earlier last summer , Intel introduced a few 7th generation processors destined for Ultrabooks and 2-in-1 devices , and now it ’ s filling out the rest of its Kaby Lake lineup with some new tech to boot . The most prominent advancement is Intel ’ s new Optane memory , which promises to give your hard drive a turbo boost for SSD-like speed . The chip maker explains the new form of memory effectively removes the delay of spinning hard drives for a snappier response time while accelerating everyday applications . If the claims prove to be true , we ’ ll never have to cry over the price of a high-capacity SSD and get back to more affordable spinning disks . Now as for what actually gets Optane memory support ? Literally any processor that supports Iris Plus graphics . Intel has also said Optane memory will be available to Intel Core i3 and above chips designed for the 200-series chipset ( i.e . the new Q250 , H270 and Z270 chipset ) . There will also be Optane memory ready chips that don ’ t necessarily come with it on the chip , but rather will allow users to upgrade their system afterwards assuming they have a compatible motherboard and a requisite m.2 flash storage connector . Although we ’ ve already seen a few U-series chips come to Ultrabooks like the Razer Blade Stealth , Intel held back on introducing its next generation Iris Plus graphics found on an even higher-end set of U-series processors . Intel claims its latest integrated graphics technology affords users with 65 % higher 3D graphics performance and the ability to create videos 40 % faster . You might think that ’ s a comparison with last generation Skylake chip , however , Intel is actually showing the difference between the new Core i7-7567U chip and its previously best Core i7-7500U mobile processor . Intel ’ s new U-series ( 15W ) lineup is as follows : Intel ’ s new U-series ( 28W ) lineup is as follows : Of course , Intel has new H- and K-series processors for serious gamers and content producers . This time around we ’ ve been promised an astonishing jump forward in performance including 20 % faster productivity and 65 % faster creation of 4K 360-degree videos . Additionally , Intel claims we ’ ll be able to play games like Overwatch at 4K while on the go . We ’ ll have to see it to believe it of course . 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake H-series ( 45W ) processors : Last but not least Intel has updated its S-series lineup destined for All-in-One PCs and mini systems like NUCs . Oddly , Intel makes its meekest claim here , noting the new processors will leaps in performance compared to a three-year old PC . When compared to a Haswell Intel Core i7-4770K processor , a newer Intel Core i7-7700K chip offers 25 % faster productivity while being 35 % faster at creating and stitching together 4K 360-degree videos .

AMD ’ s launch of Ryzen processors has made some big waves , with the new range boasting affordable 8-core models which promise blazing performance levels and have already broken world records in benchmarks – but it seems Intel could fight back with a mammoth 12-core processor . The rumor from Italian tech site Bitsandchips is that Intel is working on commercializing a 12-core ( 24-thread ) beast of a Skylake-X processor as a response to the new Ryzen models . This would be in addition to 10-core processors at the high-end of Intel ’ s range . Essentially , it would be Intel flexing its muscles and playing the ‘ more cores ’ card – a strategy AMD isn ’ t unfamiliar with itself , of course . That would certainly seem to indicate Intel is worried about how competitive Ryzen is , and rightly so given what we ’ ve seen thus far , and in particular AMD ’ s pricing . Naturally , a 12-core enthusiast CPU would doubtless be very expensive , but the introduction of beefier models like this could have a trickle-down effect on prices , making 6/8-core processors more affordable . Which is what Intel surely must do in the face of AMD ’ s new chips . Granted , the source of this rumor isn ’ t one we ’ re particularly familiar with in the world of hardware leaks , but as Wccftech.com , which spotted the news , observes , the Italian site has apparently made some reliable processor predictions in the past . So yes , the usual condiment-related caveats apply – plenty of salt , in other words – but the fact is that Intel does need to make some sort of response , and a bit of core-count posturing ( and possibly also a resulting domino effect on prices ) is not an unbelievable prospect . In case you somehow missed all the Ryzen news , this is how competitive the new range is : AMD ’ s 8-core flagship CPU ( 1800X ) beats Intel ’ s Core i7-6900K in Cinebench R15 multi-threaded by a score of 1,601 to 1,474 . And the former is priced at $ 499 ( about £400 , AU $ 650 ) , less than half the price of the 6900K .

There has been a sudden avalanche of leaked information concerning AMD ’ s incoming Ryzen processors , pouring a whole heap of fresh fuel onto the hype fire , with some exciting details on the performance and pricing fronts – particularly for gamers . According to the leaked info published by Wccftech , the Ryzen line-up will consist of 17 different CPUs ranging from quad-core to 8-core ( although we ’ d already heard that ) , with TDPs running from 65W to 95W , and Black Edition models that boast XFR tech ( eXtended Frequency Range ) . What does that mean ? Essentially , not only do you get standard Turbo for the clock speed , but if the chip is remaining cool enough , XFR will automatically pile on an extra boost in performance – so the better your cooler , the more mileage you ’ re going to get here . Some of the most exciting CPUs leaked here – and remember , this is leaked , not confirmed , information – include high-end processors which benefit from XFR , but don ’ t carry a weighty price tag . Perhaps the most tempting is the Ryzen 7 1700X 8-core processor which has a base clock speed of 3.4GHz and Turbo to 3.8GHz , but XFR can intelligently push it beyond 3.8GHz depending on heat tolerances , as mentioned . And this offering is apparently set to be priced at just $ 389 ( around £310 , AU $ 510 ) . For the money , this CPU has posted some truly impressive benchmarks ( again , leaked ones obviously enough ) , outdoing Intel ’ s Broadwell-E i7 6900K in many tests – a processor which costs approaching three times as much . And as regards single-threaded performance in Passmark – an important indication of how smoothly things will run in terms of real-world gaming – the 1700X was right on the heels of the i7 6900K ( hitting a score of 2046 compared to 2095 for Intel ’ s beefy chip ) . And then there ’ s the model up , the Ryzen 7 1800X , which promises even better performance with a base clock of 3.6GHz and Turbo to 4.0GHz , again with XFR boosting beyond that . This CPU is allegedly going to run to $ 499 ( around £400 , AU $ 650 ) , which again is incredibly competitive given the performance levels on offer here . All of these next-gen Black Edition chips will reportedly come bundled with the firm ’ s HS81 Wraith cooling solution – a quality stock cooler – meaning that they ’ ll be able to deliver on the XFR front out-of-the-box , without the need to go spending extra on a fancy fan/heatsink . Ryzen quad-core models will also be very tempting for gamers on more of a budget , with the top-end quad-core processor being the AMD Ryzen 5 1400X running at 3.5GHz base with Turbo to 3.9GHz and XFR to go beyond that – priced at $ 199 ( around £160 , AU $ 260 ) . And note that all of these processors are fully unlocked for overclocking , meaning there ’ s the potential to buy one of these cheaper CPUs , and really juice it up – particularly if you throw in a beefy cooler – to get performance along the lines of the aforementioned 8-core models for what could be an astonishingly competitive price . Let ’ s try not to get too carried away yet , but it ’ s fair to say that if you weren ’ t already excited about Ryzen , you should be now . The new CPUs are expected to be unleashed at the beginning of next month .

Kaby Lake ? Forget about it – even though it ’ s hardly old news – because later this year , Intel ’ s next-generation processors ( the eighth incarnation of the Core family ) are set to arrive promising a considerable performance boost . According to a slide tweeted by Intel , Coffee Lake , as the eighth-gen is known , will arrive in the second half of 2017 . So that could be as early as July , theoretically ; just five months ’ time… The slide reveals that Coffee Lake will be 15 % faster than Kaby Lake based on Sysmark scores – an equal boost to the 15 % rise seen from Skylake to Kaby Lake on that benchmark ( although it will be interesting to see what this boost translates to in the likes of 3DMark and real-world gaming performance ) . This is something of a shock announcement , considering that last summer , Intel ’ s roadmap showed that Coffee Lake wasn ’ t due to emerge until 2018 . The timing of this tweet , and the apparent stepping up of Intel ’ s schedule , is interesting given that we are just a few short weeks away from AMD unleashing its Ryzen CPUs , with which the company hopes to claw back some turf in the desktop processor market . Coffee Lake is still built on a 14nm process as with Kaby Lake , but as we heard last summer , it ’ s expected to bring six-core CPUs into the fold of Intel ’ s mainstream processor offerings . ( Intel has of course made six-core efforts before , but those were enthusiast chips with expensive price tags , not affordable for the average punter ) . Fingers crossed , then , that we get some beefy beasts of processors rolling out later on this summer , which hopefully might have to be more competitive on price if Ryzen lives up to the hype AMD is putting behind it .

AMD has pulled off a design feat when it comes to manufacturing its latest Ryzen processors – which are due to land imminently – with the CPU being more compact than a 14nm Skylake processor from Intel , and doubling up on the amount of L2 cache , too . According to a report from EE Times , engineers from AMD made these revelations in a paper which stated that a quad-core Ryzen processor was just over 10 % smaller than a quad-core Skylake CPU , taking up 44mm2 in terms of its area , compared to 49mm2 for the latter . Both CPUs are manufactured using a 14nm process . The Zen-based effort from AMD will also boast 512KB of L2 cache in comparison to 256KB on board the Intel chip . These are design wins which add to the current feeling of anticipation building around the Ryzen CPUs , which it ’ s hoped will make AMD competitive again in the processor world – meaning lower prices for processors all-round in the longer run , with any luck . Apparently even Intel ’ s engineers have admitted that Zen clearly looks competitive , which is certainly no bad sign . Most of the chatter thus far has been about eight-core Ryzen CPUs , and indeed this report also mentions that AMD has two eight-core designs running at 3.4GHz with simultaneous multithreading . Naturally , we ’ ll only know how competitive Ryzen actually is when it comes to the launch of the processors , although as we mentioned previously , the many leaks that are popping up here and there are certainly building excitement – with some nicely impressive benchmarks around . Indeed , we saw some pretty compelling game benchmarks at the close of last year ( albeit from engineering samples ) , with positive noises on the power efficiency front , too . AMD said it will launch the Ryzen chips at the beginning of March , although there has been chatter on the grapevine that they could start shipping marginally quicker – as soon as the end of this month .

Intel is planning to make its own hybrid laptop with a curved display , according to a report citing a leaked patent . As revealed by The Leaker , Intel ’ s patent shows a detachable notebook in the style of Microsoft ’ s Surface range , with one major difference – both the screen and keyboard have a gentle curve . The curved screen is something we ’ ve seen a lot of with TVs and monitors ( featuring ultra-wide 21:9 displays in the latter case ) these days , although of course it ’ s not so easy to translate to a notebook – even though Acer managed this feat with its Predator 21 X. That ’ s a stupidly expensive laptop , mind , and presumably Intel ’ s effort would be pitched with a mainstream price . As the patent illustrations make clear , the purported product would be a detachable , meaning you could remove the curved screen and use it as a tablet on its own , just like the Surface 2-in-1s . The Leaker further notes that it seems likely there will be a battery in both the tablet and base sections of the hybrid , with the latter possibly offering additional storage and a beefier CPU . The rumor is that this product will be launched with Intel ’ s next ( eighth ) generation of Core processors , and a low-power mode will activate when the slate is removed from the base , for extra battery life when being used as a tablet . However , before we get too carried away , remember this is just a report on a patent – and even if Intel is mulling such a design , and a shift in a fresh direction with its own notebook , there ’ s no guarantee the device will actually move forward from prototyping to production . As ever , only time will tell . Looking at the design of this machine though , one slight worry is exactly what sort of typing experience this curved keyboard will make for . Still , innovation is what Microsoft is calling for when it comes to PCs going forward , and if this offering from Intel is realized , it ’ ll certainly shake things up a bit in the hybrid arena .

Intel launched its Optane Memory – which acts as a small turbocharging cache for a traditional hard disk for an SSD-like speed boost – earlier this week , but a caveat we were unaware of has emerged : the product won ’ t work with low-end Kaby Lake processors . As we reported previously , the base requirements for Optane Memory is an M.2 storage slot ( which the memory stick plugs into ) , an Intel 200 series chipset motherboard , and a Kaby Lake ( seventh-generation ) CPU . However , as Tech Report spotted , the official list of requirements on Intel ’ s Optane website stipulates that users must have a Core i3 , i5 or i7 Kaby Lake processor . That ’ s an important distinction , because it leaves non-Core family CPUs out in the cold , even if they are the latest seventh-generation . This means Pentium and Celeron models , and on the laptop front the Core Y-series ( which were referred to as Core M pre-Kaby Lake ) , isn ’ t supported by Optane either . Clearly , then , if you ’ re building a budget PC , and were thinking of boosting a large hard drive ’ s speed with 16GB of Optane Memory , this is an issue to bear in mind . For those building from scratch , a truly budget Pentium processor , that does n't cost much more than £50 ( around $ 60 , AU $ 80 ) , won ’ t work with Optane , and if you want speedier boot times and system performance , you ’ ll have to take the traditional route of a small separate SSD to go alongside that big hard drive . That said , a base Core i3 isn ’ t exactly expensive , either – you can pick one up for just over £110 ( around $ 135 , AU $ 180 ) at the time of writing . But sometimes , with extremely tight budget builds , every pound ( or dollar ) counts . The other point to bear in mind is that those who own a PC with an existing Kaby Lake Celeron or Pentium processor won ’ t be able to do a quick Optane upgrade to supercharge their large spinning hard disk . Not unless they upgrade the CPU as well , and that really isn ’ t going to be economical compared to simply plugging in an SSD . Of course , we ’ re assuming here that when Intel says ‘ requirements ’ for Optane , these are hard requirements , as opposed to a lack of official support which might mean that Optane could still work with these budget CPUs ( even if it ’ s something Intel doesn ’ t recommend ) . From what we can see here though , that isn ’ t the case . Via : Digital Trends

Asus has just pushed out UEFI BIOS updates that allow compatible motherboards to make full use of Intel ’ s new Optane memory for turbocharging a traditional spinning hard drive . As we saw yesterday , Intel launched low-capacity Optane modules in 16GB or 32GB flavors , which use the motherboard ’ s M.2 slot , and act as a cache drive , speeding up a larger hard disk . And Asus 200-series motherboards can now be updated to use these Optane products . The BIOS update is available now , and can be grabbed using the firm ’ s EZ Flash 3 utility , or via the Asus USB BIOS Flashback tool ( which allows for easy installation via a USB stick ) . For full instructions on how to update your BIOS , and the full list of compatible motherboards , check out Asus ’ Optane microsite . The broad idea of these small Optane cache modules is that they bring the benefit of fast SSD-like speeds to a big old hard disk , meaning you can have your storage cake and eat it in terms of getting capacity along with speedy performance . Much in the same vein as the traditional SSD cache drives of old introduced with Intel ’ s Z68 chipset some six years ago now , except the difference here is that Optane boasts even better performance gains . Optane uses 3D Xpoint technology , and according to Intel , can make a 1TB hard disk ( spinning at 7,200 rpm ) twice as responsive when performing daily computing tasks or booting up , and can reduce the time it takes for a game to launch ( or level to load ) by around the 65 % mark . Of course , a pure SSD will always be faster than a cache-turbocharged hard disk , but Optane offers a tempting option in terms of a cost-effective speed boost ( a 16GB module will set you back $ 44 – that ’ s around £35 , AU $ 60 ) . Last week , Intel also launched a full Optane SSD , the DC P4800X which has a capacity of 375GB – but this is a drive aimed at data centres , with an eye-wateringly high price . Eventually , we ’ ll see larger Optane-powered consumer drives with friendlier asking prices .

Hard drives are getting a much deserved kick in the pants with Intel ’ s new Optane Memory . The processor maker claims its newest technology will give old-school spinning drives solid-state drive-like ( SSD ) speeds today and eventually transform computer storage forever . Intel Optane Memory might sound like RAM , but it ’ s actually a specialized storage product that hooks up to the M.2 storage slot ( PCIe Gen 3.0x2 ) on a PC motherboard . You ’ ll find them on the latest motherboards designed for Intel ’ s latest 7th generation , or Kaby Lake , processors and the 200 series Intel chipset . The connected storage drive endows you with 16GB or 32GB of Optane Memory for blazing fast cache . Cache that can make , say , your 1TB , 7,200 rpm spinning hard drive twice as responsive in performing daily tasks and booting up or launch your browser up to five times faster . Oh , and how about 67 % and 65 % reductions in game app launch and game level load times , respectively ? These are the initial figures that Intel promises are possible out of a seemingly old hat , spinning hard drive when boosted by its Intel Optane Memory cache module . So , what ’ s the secret ? Intel ’ s answer to that is twofold . First off , Optane Memory is built differently than traditional NAND-based storage cells used in SSDs , instead crafted using 3DXpoint . Pronounced “ 3D crosspoint , ” this is a different kind of proprietary storage media , built using materials ( the identity of which Intel is keeping to itself ) in a three-dimensional pattern similar to how a processor is built – sort of like a s ’ more . However , a computer ’ s processor can only access data as fast as the storage medium can deliver it , which depends both on how quickly it can recall the data in its stores and how quickly data transfers over connectors , usually SATA ( off-motherboard ) or PCIe ( on-board ) these days . This is why RAM , or random access memory , was developed decades ago to store frequently used data . However , RAM is expensive to build at high capacities , and thus isn ’ t a realistic way to store all of a PC ’ s data . “ We want something that brings that data much closer to the processor , ” Intel Senior Fellow Al Fazio told a room of journalists when debuting the technology . “ We need something that ’ s closer and faster to provide data to the processor . ” The crosspoint is the smallest and densest silicon structure that you can construct lithographically and can switch 1,000 times faster than NAND flash , according to Fazio , because of the proximity . The physics of the data delivery have been changed . Not only , as Fazio tells it , does this make it 1,000 times faster than NAND , but it provides 1,000 times better endurance than NAND and 10 times the density of conventional memory . This technology also operates at sub-microsecond speeds , Fazio said , compared to microsecond speeds of other storage and memory . The idea is to get the capacity of NAND and the speed of RAM or better in a non-volatile solution . The second piece of how Optane Memory boosts your existing storage drive is in the product ’ s intelligence . A small processor inside the M.2 memory module runs Intel Rapid Storage Technology , firmware that allows the module to detect which apps and services you use most over time , prioritizing the files associated with those apps into its 16GB or 32GB cache . This , in turn , serves up those apps and services much faster than if their files would have to be called from the storage drive proper and then placed into RAM . The result is faster boot times , app start times , in-app data loads and generally improved responsiveness in your most-used apps . Now , while Optane Memory can reach higher capacities than RAM for cheaper , it ’ s not quite at the point of replacing either your RAM or your hard drive or SSD . This product is architected as a memory , not a storage device . In short , you can not dual boot an Intel Optane Memory module – sorry , savvy users . Now , mind that , in order to improve the speed of functions like boot time and improved responsiveness in system services , a certain amount of the Optane Memory module ’ s cache is reserved for these system process files . Exactly how much , Intel won ’ t say . Also , again , the Intel Optane Memory module only operates with motherboards that support both 7th generation Intel processors and Intel ’ s 200 series chipset . So , if you can ’ t spruce up your old hard drive with that 6th generation or older Intel chip and dated motherboard , who is this for ? For one , those looking to upgrade their PCs with gobs of storage that ’ s also fast could look to this as a more affordable route to that kind of PC build . After all , a 2TB spinning hard drive calls for a fraction of the cost of an equally capacious SSD . To that end , Intel has worked with partners to ensure that over 130 of such supported motherboards are available right now . We ’ re also told that Intel is already working with key desktop PC producers to include the option for Intel Optane memory modules in models that generally offer large amounts of spinning storage . So , otherwise hapless PC purchasers will effectively enjoy the speed of an SSD for the cost of a PC with an old hat spinning drive inside , thanks to an Optane Memory module . Since Intel first revealed its Optane storage technology way back in 2015 , we ’ ve dreamt of a world free of distinctions like “ storage ” and “ RAM ” . While that reality is still a ways off , Intel ’ s new Optane Memory module finally begins to blur those lines today . Optane Memory looks to set the computing world on fire when it launches for desktop PCs on April 24 . In the US , Optane Memory will cost $ 44 for 16GB while 32GB will call for $ 77 . We 're awaiting comment from Intel on pricing and availability in the UK and Australia , and will update this space with whatever information we receive .

A 32-core ( 64-thread ) monster CPU from Intel , apparently the Skylake ‘ Purley ’ flagship , is the subject of the latest leak to emerge in the processor world . Details of the chip were spilled via a Geekbench performance benchmark ( as spotted by Wccftech.com ) , and this is allegedly likely to be the Xeon E5 2699 v5 . The 32-core CPU managed to produce some breath-taking numbers in Geekbench , with a multi-core score of 49,647 , hitting 3,526 when it came to single-core performance . As Wccftech.com notes , that ’ s probably the highest multi-core benchmark ever achieved on Geekbench ( when talking about single socket processors ) . Apparently the chip is for an upgraded LGA 3647 socket and operates with a base clock of 2.1GHz ( although the Geekbench details show it running at 2.3GHz ) . ‘ Purley ’ also promises better power efficiency ( naturally ) and will support 6-channel DDR4 ( up from 4-channel ) . What ’ s also very interesting here is that Purley was previously said to max out at up to 28-cores , but Intel has reportedly upped the ante in order to match AMD ’ s Naples processors which offer up to 32-cores . AMD officially unveiled its Naples CPUs a couple of weeks back , offering some very impressive claimed performance levels when compared to the current Xeon E5-2699A v4 ( the latter runs to 22-cores ) . These chips aim to make a big impact in the server market ( following the recent release of Ryzen CPUs for desktop PCs ) . Of course , pricing will be a key point in the battle between these beefy processors , and it ’ s likely that this particular Intel monster will carry a weighty price tag to say the least .

Intel has revealed its first Optane SSD which uses the much-talked-about 3D XPoint technology that took the company a decade to hone . The Optane DC P4800X is a 375GB solid-state drive in the form of a PCIe card , and it ’ s aimed at heavyweight data centre usage , promising very low latency and high throughput . According to Intel , the SSD boasts a latency of under 10µs and offers random read/write speeds of up to 550,000/500,000 IOPs . What ’ s also very interesting is that the P4800X can use Intel ’ s ‘ memory drive technology ’ to make the SSD appear to be DRAM to the operating system , a useful added trick on the flexibility front . Intel notes that Optane SSDs offer “ unrivalled performance at low queue depth , where the vast majority of applications generate storage workloads , which means CPUs are more active and more fully utilised ” . The company also boasted of high endurance ratings , with the P4800X being capable of 30 DWPD ( drive writes per day ) , with a claimed total lifespan of 12.3 petabytes . The drive is available in an ‘ early ship program ’ now , with more form factors and bigger capacities due to become available in the second half of this year . As spotted by ExtremeTech , it retails at $ 1,520 ( around £1,230 , AU $ 1,970 ) , so it ’ s far from cheap ( and those larger capacity drives will be much more expensive still , of course ) . As we already mentioned , this is an SSD targeted at data centre use , but it ’ s a sign of things to come – eventually we ’ ll see high-performance Optane drives aimed at consumer PCs with less frightening price tags . Optane is , however , already being used for cache drives in mainstream laptops like the ThinkPad T series ( which has an optional 16GB Optane SSD ) .

With PC sales slowing and Intel seeming incapable of making up the ground lost to mobile chip rivals like Qualcomm , the computing company is having to diversify its interests – and self-driving cars seem to have risen to the top of Intel 's agenda , as it 's just spent a whopping $ 15.3 billion in order to acquire MobilEye and its autonomous vehicle tech . Having previously worked with MobilEye on BMW 's iNext self-driving vehicle platform , Intel now hopes to leverage the experience of the Israeli-based company to build a third-party self-driving system architecture that any car manufacturer can buy into . Rather than developing pricey algorithms and a driverless knowledge base , car manufacturers will instead just be able to dip into Intel and MobilEye 's pool . MobilEye is not a company immune to controversy , however . It experienced a relatively acrimonious split with Tesla after voicing concerns over the way Elon Musk 's company was selling its driver-assistance features . MobilEye built the system , and felt that Tesla was dangerously close to selling the concept to the public as a completely driverless solution at the time . The driverless firm will enjoy some stability under Intel 's wing then , while Intel picks itself up a company with close to 20 years of experience in car technologies . It 's a huge purchase ( and one of the biggest in Israeli tech history ) , but it seems a relatively safe bet for Intel . With everyone from Google to Uber and Ford to Tesla preparing for the driverless revolution , Intel will want to make sure it 's on the starting grid , and not repeating the rolling start it 's faced with mobile .

When it comes to VR , you might say that Intel maintains a behind-the-scenes approach compared to Nvidia and AMD ’ s chest beating . However , high-end processing power is just as important as graphics for the demanding requirements of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive on PC . For that reason , Intel is far from an underdog in the VR space , although the company is still well aware of the dangers of VR ’ s starkly divided audience . On the high-end , a VR headset will set you back upwards of $ 600 ( about £489 , AU $ 792 ) . That ’ s without factoring in the $ 1,000+ PC required to use it . Meanwhile , low-end VR is littered with mobile smartphone solutions , offering bite-sized games and apps to those curious about the technology , but not nearly curious enough to drop a more substantial chunk of cash . Save for perhaps Sony ’ s PlayStation VR , there is hardly anything occupying the middle ground . At the 2017 Game Developers Conference ( GDC ) this week , we spoke with Kim Pallister , director of the Intel VR Center of Excellence , about the virtual reality improvements the industry needs to see next . Amongst our conversations , Pallister stressed that VR is lacking when it comes to support for mid-range devices such as lightweight Intel Kaby Lake-powered notebooks . “ We really think that for [ VR ] to hit the mainstream – for it to get to a critical mass where developers can make money – there needs to be good/better/best solutions , ” he said . “ There needs to be a range of price and things that play in the mainstream space . ” As such , Intel has been working with its partners to make VR devices more accessible and cheaper without stripping it of high quality components . A major part of this puzzle was a collaboration with Microsoft , which was revealed back in October of last year to be a lineup of Windows 10-compatible VR HMDs . These come from a variety of different manufacturers including Acer , Dell and HP featuring various styles and designs , but with one thing in common : low PC spec requirements . “ As much as everyone loves the high-end enthusiast stuff , that alone is not enough to sustain a sizable market with a wide variety of content , ” Pallister asserted . “ We ’ ve been focused on the hard problem of getting a mainstream-type solution to market and Microsoft is one of the primary partners we ’ ve been working with there . ” To migrate VR over to more conservative PCs , however , there are sacrifices to clearly be made , sacrifices Intel is well aware of . The bigger challenge is determining where users won ’ t mind the compromise . From Pallister ’ s perspective , a lot of the pixels are already being wasted in VR , paving the way for opportunities aplenty to make virtual reality less reliant on high-end discrete GPUs . “ There are a lot of problems in the VR space where people just said , ‘ Just throw more GPU at it , you ’ ve got a high-end gamer GPU in there , you ’ ve got a $ 400 GPU , just solve this problem with more GPU , ’ ” Pallister told us . He says that developers have a tendency to render everything at the highest detail , even in situations where it isn ’ t needed . Because VR is 360 degrees of visual stimulation , there ’ s a lot being depicted in-game while the player only sees a narrow cone . As Pallister puts it , you have “ all of these other pixels that are way too much detail for what you can ’ t see out there , you just throw all that away . ” For mobile VR , high-end PC VR and everything in between , the trick is to “ not waste time putting detail where you don ’ t need it . ” “ I think that ’ s something you ’ ll see the whole industry focus on over the next couple years , ” which will be a piece of how you get down to more affordable price points , VR that works with thin and light notebooks [ and ] that doesn ’ t require a big , beefy desktop . ” Pallister believes there ’ s an audience for VR at the mid-range , even if it ’ s not gaining the traction he contends it deserves . “ Part of the benefit of an open platform like PC is the market will find ways to fill that spectrum in , ” he said . “ There are people who like VR that don ’ t think the phone is good enough that can ’ t afford a Vive , so let ’ s aim for a solution there . ” Luckily , according to Pallister , we ’ re already on the right path to seeing VR work on a wider range of devices , though it ’ s a far cry from where we could be . As he reminded us , Oculus took its system requirements down a peg last year . Letting users with as low as an Intel Core i5-4590 yields benefits for everyone with a virtual reality HMD . “ You saw this even with Oculus when they introduced asynchronous space warp and their scalability features last year , ” he said . With one software feature , they were able to drop their graphics performance requirements by 40 % . ” “ Is there a trade-off in quality , sure , but that ’ s okay , that ’ s the way PC gaming works is that people can come in at different points and then decide if they want to dial things up or down . ”

Fancy having a look at some comparative gaming benchmarks pitting AMD ’ s new Ryzen processors against Intel rivals ? Then your luck ’ s in , because AMD has released a whole slew of official results to feast your peepers on . In 4K gaming , AMD pitted its Ryzen 7 1800X against Intel ’ s Core i7-6900K , in a system which had 16GB of RAM and an Nvidia Titan X graphics card ( the latest Pascal offering ) . Average frame rate scores were , overall , very close across a range of games . AMD sneaked a win in Battlefield 4 with 72 fps ( frames per second ) playing Intel ’ s 70 fps , and it was a similar story in Ashes of the Singularity ( 54 fps versus 53 fps ) . Doom ( using Vulkan ) was more of a victory for the AMD processor which achieved 81 fps compared to 75 fps for the 6900K . Intel ’ s processor just edged the GTA V benchmark , though , with 123 fps compared to 122 fps for AMD , and the Core i7 was a clear winner in Civilization VI , hitting 83 fps versus 69 fps . Using 99th percentile frames per second benchmarks – i.e . excluding 1 % of potential outliers , to get a better indication of overall smoothness , essentially a more accurate average – gave similar results , but tipped things a little more in AMD ’ s favor when it came to Battlefield 4 ( 54 fps beat Intel ’ s 44 fps ) . As for 1440p gaming , AMD pitted the Ryzen 1700X against Intel ’ s Core i7-6800K in a system which had 16GB of RAM and an Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card . The Intel processor had a slight lead across most benchmarks , but again it was a very close run thing . In favor of Intel , the average frame rate in GTA V was 145 fps versus 139 fps , with Battlefield 4 witnessing 115 fps beat 111 fps , and Ashes of the Singularity was 56 fps edging out 55 fps . AMD ’ s chip did take one benchmark though – Doom ( Vulkan ) hit 127 fps on the 1700X compared to 123 fps . 99th percentile fps benchmarks were a similar story , save for one exception : GTA V swung heavily in AMD ’ s favor with 71 fps leaving Intel ’ s 52 fps in the dust . When the Ryzen 1700 was matched against the Core i7-7700K ( in a PC with 16GB RAM and a GTX 1070 ) it was a similar story of the former pretty much keeping up with the latter . With average frame rates , both processors hit 44 fps in Ashes of the Singularity , although Intel had the clear lead in GTA V with 190 fps beating out 167 fps . AMD outdid Intel in a couple of games , though . Battlefield 4 , for example : 94 fps played 93 fps – and in Doom ( Vulkan ) AMD achieved a narrow victory by 101 fps to 98 fps . Of course , we have to bear the pricing in mind here , particularly when it comes to AMD ’ s flagship 1800X , which retails at $ 499 ( £489 in the UK , around AU $ 790 ) . Compare that to Intel ’ s Core i7-6900K which it was benchmarked against – that card runs to around the $ 1,000/£1,000 mark ( around AU $ 1,600 ) . Here at TechRadar Towers , we ’ ve also been performing our own gaming benchmarks comparing the Ryzen 1800X with Intel ’ s Core i7-7700K . These tests were run at 1440p resolution with maximum detail levels , on a PC that consisted of an Asus Crosshair VI Hero AM4+ motherboard , 16GB of RAM and an Nvidia GTX 1080 . In Total War : Attila , the Ryzen chip achieved 39 fps , only lagging a touch behind the Core i7-7700K which managed 41 fps . It was a similar story in Far Cry Primal , with the AMD processor racking up 75 fps compared to 77 fps for Intel . In both Rise of the Tomb Raider and Deus Ex : Mankind Divided , the CPUs scored identically with both hitting 43 fps and 13 fps respectively . ( Note that Deus Ex is the exception here – only being run at ‘ very high ’ details , and suffering badly on the optimization front for Nvidia drivers , as you can see ) . Compared to AMD ’ s 4K benchmarking of the 1800X versus the 6900K , this is a much more favorable comparison for Intel on the cost-effectiveness front , given that the Core i7-7700K is priced at around $ 340 or £300 in the UK ( about AU $ 485 ) .

When it comes to choosing a processor for PC gaming , there are only two contenders : Intel and AMD . As part of TechRadar ’ s PC Gaming Week , we ’ ve pitted the two titans of the CPU world against each other . In the red corner , we have AMD , the plucky pretender to the throne that ’ s had a rough few years out in the wilderness , but has now come out swinging with its new line of Ryzen CPUs . In the blue corner , there ’ s Intel , the current world champion – but for how long ? The battle of the CPUs has just heated up with AMD ’ s release of Ryzen . Competitive price and performance could mean that Intel ’ s once unassailable lead in the gaming PC processor race could be in trouble . So , which company builds the best CPU for slapping into your gaming rig ? There ’ s only one way to find out… fight ! Both PCs used in this showdown were built by Fierce PC , a UK-based company , and come packed with some of the latest technology . Imperial Clash - AMD Edition CPU : 3.8GHz AMD Ryzen 7 1700 ( 8-core , 16MB cache ) GPU : Asus ROG STRIX GeForce GTX 1080 8GB Hard Drive : Seagate 1TB Hybrid SSHD Cooling System : Thermaltake Water 3.0 RGB Fans 240mm Water PSU : Thermaltake Smart Pro 650W Fully ModularRGB Fan RAM : Corsair Vengeance LPX 2400MHz 16GB DDR4 Memory SSD : Samsung SM961 256GB Super Fast M.2 Drive Storage Case : Thermaltake View 27 Mid Tower Case Imperial Clash - Intel Edition CPU : 4.6Ghz Intel Core i7-7700K ( 4-core , 8MB cache ) GPU : Asus ROG STRIX GeForce GTX 1080 8GB Hard Drive : Seagate 1TB Hybrid SSHD Cooling System : Thermaltake Water 3.0 RGB Fans 240mm Water PSU : Thermaltake Smart Pro 650W Fully ModularRGB Fan RAM : Corsair Vengeance LPX 2400MHz 16GB DDR4 Memory SSD : Samsung SM961 256GB Super Fast M.2 Drive Storage Case : Thermaltake View 27 Mid Tower Case Our two contenders first squared up over GTA V. You may have heard of this game – it ’ s sold 75 million copies since the last count – with its combination of violence , satire and storytelling obviously striking a chord with gamers around the world . And of course , the best place to play it is on PC . With a huge open world that teems with people , wildlife and of cars to steal and drive , GTA V can give any PC it ’ s installed on a good workout . For this round , we used the built-in benchmark tool for GTA V to see just how well each rig can run the game at 1080p resolution . First , we ran the benchmark on both PCs with all graphical settings set to low . As we suspected , this didn ’ t cause either rig a problem , with the AMD system hitting an average of 154.35 frames per second ( fps ) . The Intel system didn ’ t quite reach those heights , with an average fps of 148.59 . Still , these are incredibly impressive speeds that console gamers could only dream of . But , no one wants to play games at the lowest possible settings ! So , we also put all the settings to maximum in order to really test these systems . This involved increasing texture and shadow details , as well as boosting the density of people and vehicle population . Despite the extra workload placed on the machines , both PCs performed admirably , with the AMD rig averaging 66.61 fps , and the Intel machine scoring 70.23 fps . These are both more than double the frames-per-second scores that the Xbox One and PS4 can manage . Both AMD and Intel put up a great fight in this opening round , but Intel just ekes out a win , thanks to a few extra frames per second during the ultra benchmark test . Even so , the AMD machine nipped at its heels , and both CPUs proved they can produce an amazing GTA 5 experience . The Division is another popular PC game that puts PCs through their paces , thanks to a combination of large open world design and impressive graphics . Once again , we ran the built-in benchmark test that comes with the game on both low and ultra settings to see how well these PCs could cope . On the lowest settings , the AMD Ryzen rig decimated the test , scoring a huge 189.9 fps on average . Not to be outdone , the Intel machine put up an an even better fight , managing 229.6 fps on the lowest setting . But , what about with the graphical settings all whacked up to the max ? The AMD machine remained sure-footed with an impressively high fps of 97.7 . That ’ s an immense performance considering all the graphical bells and whistles enabled in ultra mode . What ’ s even more impressive is that the PS4 just about manages 30 fps at 1080p , while the Xbox One can ’ t even reach 1080p resolutions and a solid 30 fps ! So , with that kind of performance , does AMD have this round in the bag ? Unfortunately not , as Intel again comes out swinging with a whopping 104.1 fps ! In both benchmarks , Intel proves to be the victor , with a clear fps advantage . However , AMD shouldn ’ t be too despondent – its performance is still very good – and blows current consoles out of the water . With the games out of the way , we ’ re now putting the AMD and Intel gaming PCs through a series of benchmark tests that will truly find out what the best processor is for gaming . We ’ ll start with the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark . This is a recent test that puts DirectX 12-toting machines through their paces . It does this by rendering a number of action scenes with an animated character as it walks through a museum ( which contains exhibits of former 3DMark benchmarks , offering some geeky Easter eggs ) . The location the benchmark film takes place in is incredibly detailed , and at certain points the demo includes fast moving action , and a huge crystal-like monster . All of this is designed to bring even the most powerful PCs to their knees . Despite being a benchmark that primarily targets graphics cards , it ’ s also a good indicator of how well each processor backs up the GPU when they are being thoroughly tested . As with other 3DMark benchmark tests , the results are given as a set of numbers , with the higher the score , the better the performance . The AMD PC was first up , and managed 7,312 – a very decent score considering how intensive this benchmark workout is . Next up , Intel entered the ring , and scored a still decent 7,135 – but not quite enough to best AMD . Once again , the scores are pretty close , with AMD edging out Intel . This suggests that the AMD chip is slightly better at helping the GPU handle some of the advanced graphics tasks the Time Spy benchmark utilises – such as asynchronous compute . Fire Strike is another graphically-intensive benchmark test that has been built to put the latest high-performance gaming PCs through their paces , and it features impressive real-time graphics that can show off what gaming rigs are capable of . Once again , it features highly detailed environments , fast action and complex graphical and environmental effects , such as explosions and fire . With this test , the AMD rig put in a very good performance with a score of 15,444 . Meanwhile , the Intel machine , bruised from its loss in the last round , fought back with a mighty 18,043 . The Intel machine takes the lead with this test , showing that it ’ s a formidable processor for intensive games – as long as you pair it with a powerful graphics card – like we did with the GTX 1080 . Our final 3DMark benchmark is Sky Diver . This is one of the easier benchmark tests in the 3DMark suite , aimed more at gaming laptops and mid-range PCs . However , it is still a valuable tool for gauging just how well a PC can handle DirectX 11 graphics , especially when it comes to physics . Showing off realistic physics ( such as how scenery can get destroyed and react to gravity , for example ) is a key part to making games feel more immersive and realistic than ever , so a good score in the Sky Diver benchmark is definitely a good sign that your rig is up to the task . In this test , the AMD machine put in a great performance with a score of 36,851 . Such a high score compared to the other 3DMark benchmarks shows how Sky Diver is a less intense benchmark to pass . Not to be outdone , the Intel machine produced a score of 39,210 . Intel blasts ahead of AMD in this round . That said , the very high scores both PCs obtained shows just how powerful they are – either one would be a fantastic choice for your gaming rig . The next benchmark test we put both PCs through was courtesy of Geekbench 4 . This suite of tests can be used to benchmark a range of devices , and we used it to test out how well the processors in each machine perform under stressful circumstances . As the processors are the two main features that differentiate the two PCs , this is a round that each contestant would really want to win . The benchmark replicates real-world tasks and applications , sometimes very complex ones , and uses them to see how the processors react . A higher score means the CPU is more proficient at completing those tasks . Can the AMD Ryzen 7 1700 beat the Intel Core i7-7700K ? Well , the AMD scored 3,589 in the single core benchmark , and 19,054 in the multi core tests . Meanwhile , the Intel machine racked up 5,762 in the single core benchmark , and 17,314 in the multi core tests . We ’ re going to have to call this one a draw , and the mixed results really show the strengths of both the AMD and the Intel processors . Intel ’ s higher single core score points to more powerful individual cores in the chip . The fact that Fierce PC , the builders of the two rigs we ’ re testing , overclocked the Intel Core i7-7700K to 4.6GHz , while the AMD Ryzen 7 1700 is overclocked at 3.8GHz goes some way to explaining the improved single core success of the Intel chip . Meanwhile , AMD ’ s dominance in the multi-core benchmark is a clear indicator that AMD ’ s choice to include eight cores in its Ryzen 7 CPUs , compared to the Intel chip ’ s four cores , was a wise one . So , for single-core processes , the Intel chip is the one to go for , but for multi-core processes , you ’ d want the AMD . DirectX 12 , a popular collection of application programming interfaces ( API ) that many games use for advanced graphical effects , now uses multi-core CPUs more effectively than previous versions . So , while octa-core CPUs , like the AMD Ryzen 7 1700 , may still be a bit of an overkill for some games , if you want to future proof your gaming machine , you may want to look at the CPU with the best multi-core performance . Cinebench is the next hurdle our two competitors must clear , and it ’ s another benchmark that uses real-world tests to stress out the hardware of the machines it ’ s running on to see just how powerful ( or not ) your PC is . In the CPU benchmark , it uses the PC ’ s processor to render a photorealistic 3D scene whilst using a number of algorithms designed to stress all available processor cores . According to Maxon , the company behind the Cinebench benchmark , the CPU test renders 2,000 objects ( made up of over 300,000 polygons ) , with sharp and blurred reflections , lighting , shadows and many more complex effects . At the end of the test , the CPU is given a score – and the higher the number , the faster the processor is . Once again , we tested the AMD machine first , and it fared very well with a score of 1,368 points . It was then the turn of the Intel machine , which put up a valiant effort , but didn ’ t quite match AMD , with a score of 892 . AMD once again took the lead in the CPU benchmark , showing that for pure processing power , the additional four cores in the Ryzen 7 1700 prove very useful . Ding ding ding ! The bell has been rung , but let ’ s sneak in a cheeky extra round : price . This is traditionally AMD ’ s strongest area , as it is often able to undercut Intel on price grounds . On its own , an AMD Ryzen 7 1700 processor will set you back around £300/ $ 310/around AU $ 400 . Meanwhile , an Intel Core i7-7700K CPU will set you back around the same , at £320/ $ 350/around AU $ 460 . The price is also very close if you buy the ready-made PCs we tested here . The Fierce PC Imperial Clash – Intel Edition goes for £1,849.95 ( around $ 2,350 , AU $ 3180 ) , while the Fierce PC Imperial Clash – AMD Edition is priced at £1,819.95 ( around $ 2,300 , AU $ 3100 ) . It ’ s a very close result to call , but AMD is still marginally cheaper than Intel . So , if you ’ re a budget-conscious gamer , you ’ ll want to pick the AMD Ryzen 7 CPU for its price and performance combination . However , the price difference isn ’ t that great , so if the rounds wherein the Intel machine pulled ahead have impressed you , then you won ’ t go wrong with paying extra for the additional oomph . What a fight ! When these two heavyweights first squared up , we wouldn ’ t think that it would be this close . Both machines put in brilliant performances in all the tests , and each one had a number of rounds in which they truly shined . The Intel machine , packing a Core i7-7700K processor , pulled ahead in the first few rounds when it came to pushing the most frames per second in some of the most demanding PC games . However , the AMD Ryzen 7 1700-toting PC remained competitive , especially during the rounds where it could really show off its octa-core might . The fact that it kept toe-to-toe with the Intel machine , while remaining cheaper , is also supremely impressive . But neither machine landed a knockout blow that completely destroyed its competition . That means we can recommend either machine ( and the CPUs they use ) as an ideal choice for PC gamers . But there can be only one champion , and while both competitors won the same amount of rounds , there was one contender who excelled at the gaming benchmarks , which is what counts in this contest . So , this year ’ s PC Gaming Week CPU Champion is… Can AMD take the crown next time ? We ’ ll no doubt be holding a rematch very soon… Welcome to TechRadar 's 3rd annual PC Gaming Week , celebrating the almighty gaming PC with in-depth interviews , previews , reviews and features all about one of the TechRadar team ’ s favorite pastimes .

Intel ’ s Optane Memory modules look to bring high-speed storage to more people , aiming to bolster cheaper spinning drives as an alternative to solid-state storage with a solution that ’ s less expensive for the purchaser overall . Of course , one area where Intel hopes to see traction for these M.2 slot-bound modules is PC gaming , a hobby that ’ s expensive enough as it is , with many gamers having to choose between fast ( SSD ) and capacious ( HDD ) storage solutions , but not able to get both without spending a small fortune . While these modules require the latest Intel chipset to function , the idea is to bring the speed of SSDs to higher-capacity HDDs without resorting to today ’ s common SSD boot drive solution . An option that , mind you , many PC gamers can ’ t realistically afford and some can ’ t be bothered to configure . So , does Intel Optane ’ s 3DXpoint technology grant spinning hard drives a new lease on life inside gaming PCs everywhere ? Well , we wouldn ’ t say everywhere , but Optane certainly does work . It just depends entirely too much on the game at hand , not to mention your financial situation and level of technical knowhow . To figure out whether Optane memory modules actually work , we ’ ve run loading tests on an Intel Optane-equipped machine provided by Intel on two top PC games . The PC is running an Intel Core i5-7500 processor with a 1TB Western Digital Black HDD at 7,200 rpm and a 32GB Intel Optane Memory module . Using a stopwatch , we ’ ve timed how long it takes for these games to load from execution to menu screen and how long each takes to load a level , or its first piece of content upon continuing a saved or new game . All below times are measured in seconds : Portal 2 full app load times : Without Intel Optane : 23.21 With Intel Optane : 23.03 Portal 2 level load times : Without Intel Optane : 13.32 With Intel Optane : 12.45 Fallout 4 full app load times : Without Intel Optane : 26.66 With Intel Optane : 22.65 Fallout 4 level load times : Without Intel Optane : 29.37 With Intel Optane : 15.84 The first game we tested was suggested by Intel as representative of Intel Optane at work : Fallout 4 . For those who haven ’ t played , it ’ s a massive game that depicts a vast world filled with tons of graphical and physics-driven elements . Unsurprisingly , Fallout 4 showed demonstrable change between load times with and without Intel Optane enabled . In loading the app , wait times were reduced by 15 % , while time loading a saved game state was brought down by a whopping 46 % . Meanwhile , a popular PC game of our choosing , Portal 2 , displayed far less significant of a change in load times between having Optane disabled and enabled . Full app load times decreased so narrowly that it would only be fair to chalk up as an anomaly . The reduction in level load times was a little more pronounced , at 6.5 % . So , will sprucing up your dated gaming rig with an Intel Optane Memory module and a bigger hard drive , in lieu of a usually-pricier SSD boot drive combined with a large hard drive , get you into your games faster than without ? ( Don ’ t forget the new Intel CPU and motherboard . ) Yes , but that apparently depends a whole lot on the games in question , or at least the type of games . A game with lots of simulation and AI involved , like Fallout 4 , clearly stands to benefit plenty . But , smaller games , like Portal 2 , perhaps simply aren ’ t big enough content-wise to see a marked benefit . At any rate , while the load time cuts you ’ re going to see in your hard drive on Intel Optane will not be uniform , your entire system will grow faster as a result and generally for less cash ( and in a less complicated way ) than going solid-state .

After almost 20 years as a staple on the tech calendar , Intel has announced it has canned its annual Developer Forum event . Killing off the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) with immediate effect , the chipset giant has confirmed it ’ s pulling the plug on its heavily attended yearly gathering in order to focus on other opportunities . The move comes as the company has seen a shift in its core business , moving away from a solely PC-centric foundation to new emerging technologies and data-centric ventures . “ Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward , ” the company announced on its website . It added : “ Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum . ” Despite killing off its annual developer conference , the company has been keen to stress that it ’ s still keen to work closely with devs on new ideas and technologies . Instead of IDF , however , the firm has confirmed that it will focus on an “ evolved ” event mix that will see a series of smaller , more specialised events take priority . These will allow developers to focus on specialist areas and interests rather than a one-for-all style event . According to an Intel spokesperson speaking with Anandtech ( via Engadget ) , “ Intel felt that IDF no longer fills the need when it comes to giving out information . ” The report added : “ As a result , the decision has been made to find new ways to communicate with the audience ( media , developers and companies ) and the ecosystem with targeted events . ” What this ultimately means for us , the consumers , however , is the potential for more free flowing product development . Without an annual event needing big news announcements on a specific date in the calendar , Intel will be free to rollout updates and announcements on a more fluid timescale . This could pose problems for developers , however , with those looking to master development for new platforms potentially having to attend multiple events rather than one to harness the skills required . This year ’ s IDF , which was tipped to take place in August , will no longer happen . There are still major developer conferences to get excited about though , even as consumers . Next month ’ s Google I/O gathering is expected to Android O formally unveiled , while Apple ’ s WWDC event in June will likely act as the launch platform for the iPhone 8-bound iOS 11 software .

Intel 's Compute Card will ship beginning in August , with nearly a dozen partners at the ready to develop compatible products for the ultra-small PC . Designed as a kind of interchangeable `` guts '' for devices like digital signage , kiosks , smart TVs , and even 2-in-1 computers , the Compute Card is functionally a complete computer that 's still small enough to fit inside a wallet . Inside the Compute Card 's 55mm x 94.5mm x 5mm form factor is not just graphics and on-board storage , but also 4GB of DDR3 RAM , an Intel-branded processor , and both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity . Originally shown off at CES 2017 , Intel has four models of the Compute Card planned for release . You can take a gander at how each model 's specifications match up to one another in the graphic below : Additionally , Intel announced that early partners such as LG , Sharp , and Foxconn are already working on Compute Card-compatible products . LG and Sharp are currently slated to make smart monitors and digital signage , respectively , while Foxconn ( as well as companies like ECS , Seneca and NexDoc ) are developing miniature desktops and all-in-one PCs that can be easily upgraded by swapping out Compute Cards . Other partners like Dell , Lenovo , HP and Pasuntech were also announced , but have yet to declare any products they intend to make using the Compute Card . It 's uncertain yet if Intel 's standardized plug-ins will take off , ( pricing details are being saved for a later date ) but we 're definitely intrigued by the concept and will keep an eye on where Intel 's micro-PCs take it next .
At one of the most exciting – but least surprising , thanks to a series of leaks and rumors – announcements at Computex 2017 , Intel unveiled its powerful new line of Core X-Series processors , including the beastly 18-core Core i9 CPU . The Intel Core i9 is the world 's first ever consumer desktop CPU with 18 cores and 36 threads – out gunning even AMD 's upcoming Ryzen 9 Threadripper CPU , which is due to come out with 16-cores . It is also the first ever teraflop desktop CPU , according to Intel . So , it looks like Intel and AMD are engaging in a full-on CPU arms race again – which is exciting news for us consumers . Its full name is the Intel Core i9-7900X X-series processor , and this first version will be made available with 10 cores and 20 threads , with 18 , 16 , 14 and 12 core variants coming soon . The 10-core i9 variant will come with a base clock speed of 3.3GHz , Inel Turbo Boost Max technology , which ups the frequency to 4.5GHz , 13.75MB of L3 cache , support for 4 channels of DDR4-2666 RAM and a TDP ( thermal design power ) of 140W . At launch it will cost $ 999 ( around £780 , AU $ 1300 ) . The 18-core Core i9 7980XE , along with the 16-core Core i9 7960X , 14-core Core i9 7940X and 12-core Core i9 7920X should follow soon . All will come with up to 44 PCIe lanes and support for Intel Optane memory . While the new Core i9 CPUs are understandably stealing the limelight , Intel also revealed the rest of the X-Series family of processors , which Intel says is its most `` scalable , accessible and powerful desktop platform ever '' , and covers a range of processors with 4 to 18 cores . These eighth generation Core processors offer a 30 % performance improvement over the current seventh generation CPUs , according to Gregory Bryant , corporate vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group at Intel Corporation , who took to the stage at Computex to announce the new generation . These CPUs will also be up to 10 % faster for multi-thread performance , and up to 15 % faster for single-thread performance compared to the current generation of Core processors . These new processors will make use of Intel 's new X299 chipset , which comes with improved I/0 capabilities . Gaming , and virtual reality in particular , will benefit from these new processors , according to Intel , and will also improve streaming for gamers who want to show off their gameplay . At the launch event Intel demoed a PC running a Core X-Series processor that was live streaming someone playing a virtual reality game to Twitch . Thanks to the power improvements of the new CPUs , the PC was able to simultaneously broadcast a number of views and angles of the gameplay live – something that would normally take a number of separate PCs to achieve . It 's all very exciting stuff , and Intel said that we should see many Core X-series processors available to buy by the holiday system this year . Maybe even in time for Black Friday , we hope .

Intel is pushing hard to make sure Thunderbolt 3 is the future of wired connectivity , announcing an aim to bring the ports to laptops everywhere through integrating Thunderbolt 3 with future processors . Better yet , the firm plans to fully release the protocol spec for the industry at large to work with , dropping royalty charges . Thunderbolt 3 being built directly into the CPU will mean that laptop manufacturers will be able to ditch the separate components currently required to bring support for the connectors – meaning more internal space , and thus the ability to make the device thinner and lighter ( or perhaps to fit a bigger battery , or go for a similar internal boost elsewhere ) . The other major prong of Intel ’ s push here is to make the Thunderbolt 3 spec available to third-party chip manufacturers on a completely royalty-free basis as of next year , making it a far more tempting prospect for chip developers to embrace . All of this should mean wider use of the port across peripherals and computers alike . Intel foresees a world in which all ports on a laptop can be the same : namely Thunderbolt 3 , with its inherent flexibility – offering data transfer , power and video signal all across one port . Of course , there are already machines which use Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports , with Intel noting that there are in excess of 120 PC designs out there which use the connectors – with that number expected to reach 150 by the end of the year . The company also gave a major nod to its partnership with Microsoft . Roanne Sones , GM of Strategy and Ecosystem for Windows and Devices at Microsoft , commented : “ Microsoft and Intel are working together to enable Thunderbolt 3 on Windows PCs to deliver on the ‘ if it fits , it works ’ potential of USB-C . The Windows 10 Creators Update enhanced plug-and-play support for Thunderbolt 3 devices , with additional enhancements planned for future OS releases . ” Intel further underlined Thunderbolt 3 ’ s diverse range of benefits across various applications including streamlined single-cable docking stations for mobile devices , `` lifelike '' virtual reality – delivering 4K resolution in VR with just one cable – and , of course , using the port to hook up an external GPU for powered-up gaming on any laptop . Can all this help Thunderbolt 3 to make some big strides forward ? We can ’ t be certain of that , but it definitely seems like these moves – integrated support on the CPU , and the end of getting stung for licensing charges – are both major steps forward in the push for more widespread adoption .

Following recently leaked details of Intel ’ s Core i9 enthusiast-targeted CPUs , spillage has occurred on the AMD front , revealing the alleged specs of the incoming high-end Ryzen 9 series processors . Going toe-to-toe with Core i9 , Ryzen 9 – also known as ‘ Threadripper ’ – will have a flagship model with 16-cores ( 32-threads , all ripe for the ripping ) . The Ryzen 9 1998X will run with a base clock speed of 3.5GHz and a boost speed of 3.9GHz , according to Wccftech.com . It ’ ll have a TDP of 155W . Compare that to Intel ’ s top-of-the-range Core i9-7920X which will have 12-cores ( 24-threads ) and a TDP of 140W , at least if the leaked details we saw yesterday are correct ( sadly no clock speeds were revealed on this one ) . The next step down in AMD ’ s line-up will be the Ryzen 9 1977X and Ryzen 9 1977 , which are 14-core ( 28-thread ) CPUs running at base and boost speeds of 3.5GHz/4.1GHz and 3.2GHz/3.7GHz respectively , with a TDP of 155W and 140W . How does that compare to Intel ’ s second-fastest i9 ? The Core i9-7900X will run with 10-cores and a base clock speed of 3.3GHz with Turbo to 4.3GHz – and Turbo 3.0 to 4.5GHz , allowing a single core to be pushed further still . So AMD has more cores , but Intel has faster boosted clock speeds ( it ’ s likely to be the same story for the flagship model ) . That said , the base clocks AMD is purported to have achieved here are certainly impressive , particularly in the light of the quoted power consumption . AMD ’ s Ryzen 9 series then steps down to 12-core processors , of which there are three models : the 1976X , 1956X and 1956 , running at 3.6GHz/4.1GHz , 3.2GHz/3.8GHz and 3GHz/3.7GHz respectively . The 1976X will have a TDP of 140W , and the others will notch down to 125W . Rounding off the range will be the 10-core Ryzen 9 1955X and 1955 chips , running at 3.6GHz/4GHz and 3.1GHz/3.7GHz respectively , with a TDP of 125W . All of these processors will support quad-channel DDR4 memory , the same as Intel ’ s Core i9 offerings – and 44 PCIe Lanes across the range ( as is the case with Intel ’ s top two i9 CPUs , the 7920X and 7900X ) . The Ryzen 9 series processors will use a modified variant of the SP3 socket , which was originally designed for AMD ’ s beefy server chips that go up to 32-cores ( Naples ) . Remember , all of this is still speculation – but given that the leaked info is pretty in-depth on both the AMD and Intel fronts , it certainly has a whiff of credibility about it . If this does turn out to be on the money , as already mentioned , AMD is certainly winning the battle of the core count with these high-end enthusiast processor ranges , while also keeping power efficiency ticking along very nicely . The mainstream Ryzen offerings are , of course , pitched very competitively compared to Intel ’ s CPUs , and there ’ s no reason to doubt this will change with the 9 series . And if the price is right for the flagship 1998X here , this 16-core 3.5GHz chip could be an extremely tempting power proposition .

Word from the CPU grapevine is that Intel is turning up the dial another notch on its processors , with the introduction of Core i9 models as a new high-end option . Previously , as you ’ re most likely aware , Intel has offered its Core family in increasingly powerful i3 , i5 or i7 flavors . Core i9 would , of course , be the logical next step . According to the leak from an Anandtech forum member , the new offerings will comprise of four Skylake-X processors and a pair of Kaby Lake-X CPUs . If this information is correct , the top-of-the-range model will be the Core i9-7920X which will have 12-cores ( 24-threads ) and a TDP of 140W ( the spilled details – some of which come from a marketing slide , interestingly enough labelled as ‘ high-end gaming ’ Core-X processors – didn ’ t mention the clock speed for this chip ) . The next CPU down will be the i9-7900X which will sport 10-cores with a base clock speed of 3.3GHz and Turbo up to 4.3GHz ( with Turbo 3.0 to 4.5GHz – meaning a single core can be boosted further to this speed , thermals willing ) . Some impressive clock speeds indeed for a chip with so many cores . Then the 7820X will be an 8-core model ( 3.6GHz with Turbo to 4.3GHz ) , and the 7800X is the 6-core variant ( 3.5GHz/4GHz ) . All have a TDP of 140W and support quad-channel DDR4-2666 memory . There will also be a pair of Kaby Lake-X models as mentioned , which will be quad-core : the i7-7740K ( 4.3GHz/4.5GHz ) and the i7-7640K ( 4GHz/4.2GHz ) , both with a lower TDP of 112W . All these chips should be officially revealed at the end of the month at Computex , and they will be available in June – except for the top-end Core i9-7920X which reportedly won ’ t emerge until August . Pricing will of course be key here , especially coming after AMD ’ s launch of Ryzen processors earlier this year , but you ’ re obviously going to pay a premium for Core i9 , particularly the beefier offerings . The latter are likely to be eye-wateringly expensive , as ever with Intel ’ s very fastest enthusiast-targeted chips . It ’ ll definitely be interesting to see how these CPUs actually perform , and whether the introduction of the Core i9 tier is truly indicative of a major performance boost . But assuming this leak is on the money with the specs , these could be very potent introductions indeed . Image credit : Sweepr Via : Hot Hardware

The Build conference is underway in Seattle , and Microsoft is pushing hard with AI and Cortana , with an announcement that both Intel and HP have signed up to produce hardware featuring the digital assistant . Following in the footsteps of Harman Kardon ’ s Cortana-powered speaker ( Invoke – which is pictured above ) , HP will also make similar devices , along with Intel – and the latter is promising to knock up reference designs for Cortana-driven devices . This is according to a TechCrunch report , but other than the actual partnerships and basic intentions of these companies , no details have actually been revealed about the gadgets we might see forthcoming . We may hear more about HP and Intel ’ s potential creations as Build progresses , so keep your peepers peeled on TechRadar today and tomorrow . The smart home will potentially be a major market , so it ’ s little surprise that Microsoft has started to push Cortana into the various IoT gadgets that will furnish said homes . A big piece of Microsoft ’ s smart home puzzle was put in place recently with the Creators Update , which brought Cortana support to Windows 10 IoT Core , and thus potentially to all manner of gadgets from smart fridges to thermostats ( and indeed the Raspberry Pi 3 , for tinkerers building their own smart home stuff ) . As for Harman Kardon ’ s Invoke speaker , that ’ s expected to be available in the fall . There ’ s plenty of competition for Microsoft and partners , of course , in terms of Amazon Echo and Google Home . Also at Build today , Microsoft announced that its Cortana Skills Kit is now in public preview . The kit allows enterprising developers connect their apps and services to Cortana . On stage Microsoft demonstrated a few use cases including ordering pizza through Domino ’ s , playing music on iHeartRadio and looking up only the most important information on Cat Facts . What 's more , Microsoft promises they will work across platforms including Windows 10 , Android and iOS , as well as with standalone Cortana devices like the Invoke . You can sign up to access the public preview here .

Intel has revealed its new Xeon processor family , with refreshed branding and of course much improved performance , with the chips sampling now and expected to become available around the middle of the year . The Xeon Processor Scalable range ditches the old E3/E5/E7 naming convention , instead going for a scheme based on precious metals – processors will be named from Bronze at the low-end , through to Silver , Gold and top-end Platinum CPUs . Intel says that the new processors are a major architectural leap forward , and in fact represent the “ biggest set of data centre platform advancements in this decade ” , according to Lisa Spelman , VP and general manager of Intel Xeon at the company . As Ars Technica reports , Xeon Bronze CPUs will be basic entry-level processors , with Silver models offering excellent power efficiency chops , and Gold processors adding different options for advanced interconnects and accelerators , along with improved reliability . Integrated performance accelerators will include the likes of QuickAssist Technology and Intel Volume Management Device . The latter is designed to seamlessly manage PCIe SSDs such as Intel ’ s new Optane drives ( such as the Optane DC P4800X ) , allowing for ‘ hot plugging ’ to minimise any service downtime when swapping drives . The king of the hill Platinum processors will offer the best performance of the lot along with hardware-tightened security . Intel reckons that the new Xeon chips boast performance gains of around 3.9x higher virtualised workload throughput compared to a four-year-old system typically used today . No exact specs have been mentioned yet , but we ’ ll doubtless know more about these chips before long given that the wide availability of the processors is slated for the summer .

Intel has just patched a critical vulnerability in its vPro processors , and worryingly this flaw has existed for no less than seven years . To be precise , the problem is an escalation of privilege vulnerability in Intel ’ s Active Management Technology ( AMT ) , Intel Standard Manageability ( ISM ) , and Intel Small Business Technology firmware – a bug which could be leveraged by an attacker to gain full control over a computer , then install malware or take other nefarious actions . The average user needn ’ t worry about this , as it doesn ’ t affect Intel ’ s CPUs aimed at consumers , but business users with PCs or servers running vPro processors and utilising Intel ’ s AMT service have apparently been open to exploit for the best part of a decade . The company said the problem affected Intel ’ s manageability firmware from version 6.x through to 11.6 , but not versions before or after these . Those running any of these versions of Intel ’ s manageability firmware should ensure that their system is patched pronto , following the instructions Intel gives here . These details show you how to find out if your PC is affected , and if it is , you ’ ll need to check with your computer manufacturer for updated firmware – or if the latter isn ’ t ready yet , use the mitigations Intel advises . As Ars Technica reports , there has apparently been some debate in the security community about whether leveraging this flaw may require other conditions – such as having Local Manageability Service software running , as well as the aforementioned requirements – but it isn ’ t really clear whether this is the case or not . At any rate , this is certainly a potentially very serious vulnerability which should get your full attention until it ’ s resolved one way or another .

Intel ’ s solid-state drives have been the cream-of-the-crop for a long time , but they haven ’ t always been affordable and so now the chip maker has announced a new budget line that should be more approachable . Intel ’ s newest 545 SSDs start at $ 179 ( about £140 , AU $ 230 ) for a 2.5-inch drive with 512GB of capacity , which puts it more in line with affordable options like the Samsung 850 EVO and Crucial MX300 . The chip maker claims it was able to lower prices by implementing a new 64-layer TLC 3D NAND technology , which packs more digital space into fewer chips . In terms of transfer rates , Intel promises 550MB/s sequential reads and 500MB/s sequential writes . These are only a slight improvement from the last generation , but AnandTech points out that Intel ’ s new drives are much better at maintaining their top transfer speeds while being pushed to the limit . Intel also promises we ’ ll see more capacities , ranging from 128GB to 2TB , come out in the next few weeks . By the end of the year , there will also be an M.2 NVMe version you can plug directly into a motherboard for even greater speeds that SATA 3 can ’ t provide . Via The Verge

There ’ s been plenty of buzz about Apple ’ s supercharged iMac Pro since it was revealed earlier this month , and now the grapevine claims that this pricey all-in-one will run with Intel ’ s latest server-grade processors ( as opposed to consumer-targeted CPUs ) coupled with an ARM coprocessor . Pike 's Universum uncovered this interesting info when digging around in the firmware files for the iMac Pro ( in the latest beta of macOS ) , where there are references to the machine being powered by Intel ’ s Xeon server-class processors from the Purley platform . In other words , the iMac will be driven by Skylake-EX and Skylake-EP processors sitting in Intel ’ s LGA3647 socket , as opposed to desktop CPUs nestled in a LGA2066 socket . Of course , that ’ s a major switch in philosophy for the iMac range , but then this is a totally different kind of all-in-one for Apple , with the price tag indicating that it ’ s truly a machine aimed at the professional and creative market . Yes , in case you somehow missed it , the iMac Pro starts at $ 4,999 ( around £3,930 , AU $ 6,600 ) . The all-in-one will also have powerful AMD Radeon Vega graphics , boasting 11 teraflops of single precision compute performance , with up to 128GB ECC memory and 4TB SSD storage . So you can start to see where that price tag is coming from… Pike 's Universum also spotted that the iMac Pro will sport a Security Enclave Processor ( SEP ) , the aforementioned ARM coprocessor as seen on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar , tightening security and supporting a feature called Apple SecureBoot . The blog also speculates that the iMac Pro could eventually support a Magic Keyboard with Touch Bar ( or Touch ID fingerprint sensor ) , but that really is pure speculation . Indeed , regarding all of these revelations , it ’ s a good idea to get the salt shaker out and indulge in a liberal sprinkling of the white stuff . However , it shouldn ’ t be long before we hear more concrete details on the iMac Pro , as the computer is expected to launch in December , which is only six months away now . Via : 9 to 5 Mac

Intel has opened up pre-orders for its first salvo of Kaby Lake Core X-Series processors , so you can now reserve a beefy CPU , with shipping beginning on June 26 – just a week today . We first witnessed the revelation of Core X at Computex a few weeks back , with the range boasting some monster multi-core processors running all the way up to an 18-core Core i9 CPU – but the latter beast isn ’ t available to order yet . Rather , the initial batch of Core X models on sale run from quad-core to 10-core efforts , with five of them shipping next week ( and four more to follow ) . Those five CPUs are the following : Core i5-7640X , Core i7-7740X , Core i7-7800X , Core i7-7820X , and finally the Core i9-7900X , which is the 10-core offering . Intel claims this latter model offers up to 14 % faster multi-thread performance and 15 % better single-thread performance compared to its predecessor 10-core CPU ( Core i7-6950X ) , as benchmarked on SPEC CPU2006 . Here ’ s the full breakdown of the entire range of processors and pricing : Intel ’ s higher-core-count processors are n't included in this initial wave of pre-orders , but the company promises they will follow shortly . The 12-core Intel Core i9-7920X will come first with shipping expected to begin in August . In October , we can expect the Intel Core i9-7940X , Intel Core i9-7960X and 18-core Intel Core i9-7980X Extreme Edition . As you ’ re probably aware , these CPUs are Intel ’ s answer to AMD ’ s Ryzen Threadripper processors which go up to 16-core models . Darren Allan contributed to this article

If last year was the year of VR , 2018 will be the year of wireless virtual reality . Sure there ’ s mobile headsets like Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream to keep everyone happy but for higher end experiences like Fallout 4 or Skyrim VR , the best way to roam a wasteland or fight off a dragon would likely involve less tripping over cords . And thanks to the new Wigig wireless solution from Intel and HTC , we ’ ll be doing just that … eventually . The device was first announced at Computex and is being demoed on the E3 showfloor for journalists . There ’ s no solid release date quite yet other than early next year , and firm details about the device are still in the works . However , the demo has proved HTC has found solid ground with partners Intel and DisplayLink . At first glance , it doesn ’ t look like a device that can handle wireless VR . The Wigig sits right on top of your head as you wear an HTC Vive with several wires poking out , and just like the Oculus Santa Cruz prototype , there was plenty of black electrical tape to keep the front portion secure . Compared to photos and video of the DisplayLink XR at Computex , the tech looked a bit smaller , and while the Wigig wasn ’ t significantly heavy but there was a noticeable heftiness . That 's something Intel ’ s Kim Pallister said the team is working on , and future iterations will be much smaller and less cumbersome . In fact , they 're still not even sure that Wigig will sit on top of your head . Pallister noted that whether the device could clip onto your side or whether it attaches to your shirt , sits in your pocket , or hangs out on your belt like an old school beeper are to be determined . How the form factor will affect the battery life is also up in the air . Pallister told us that the device had been running fine all day on a full charge , and other reports state that battery life sits at two hours – but that could all improve when the Wigig device undergoes developmental changes . The last refinement Intel is still wrapping its head around is how the Wigig on your head will talk to the computer . Pallister said the components could simply be built right into computers in the future like built-in Wi-Fi , but that ’ s much further down the line . For the time being , Wigig could connect through an additional slotted component that you pop into the back of your computer or a tiny , adorable router that sits on your desk . Currently , though , WiGig ( based on the 802.11ad standard ) uses a 60GHz band to enable a low latency wireless connection from headset to PC and promises less than 7ms latency at all times . Pallister stated in an interview with TechRadar that you ’ ll get much less interference from multiple Wi-Fi devices allowing “ a much tighter signal integrity. ” This higher frequency also allows you to carry more bandwidth and , according to Pallister , “ you won ’ t need to make compromises with display resolution , you can use the full Vive resolution . ” This was put to the test during a short demo of Space Pirate Trainer . If you haven ’ t played the game before , you ’ re basically fighting off wave after wave of robots as you twirl around to shoot them . While it ’ s not the most graphically intense game , a lot is happening . Despite the chaos , the Wigig was able to keep up without issue . There was no delay or stuttering and it played just as well as tethered experiences at home . At the moment , there are several contenders trying to make VR wireless . Universities like MIT and smaller companies like Quark VR have made headlines within the last year however those prototypes are still being developed . It ’ s not exactly clear how well these wireless solutions will work since they haven ’ t been demoed but if they ’ re anything like Wigig , then it ’ s safe to say they ’ re on the right track . The other wireless device that ’ s closest to release is an HTC accessory from TPCast . It ’ ll be the first to hit households - but only in China with no word on a worldwide launch . Then there ’ s the Santa Cruz prototype from Oculus . As a self-contained VR headset , it stands apart from what HTC and Intel intend to release but nevertheless remains an equally exciting untethered device . While there have been updates on the tech that makes Santa Cruz tick , it won ’ t be seen on store shelves anytime soon . The biggest questions about wireless solutions right now are how companies will price the accessories and what battery life will be like . Pallister did n't comment on these details and said the final decisions on cost , how to bundle the device and whether the Vive would be completely rebranded would be entirely up to HTC . Here ’ s hoping we won ’ t have to keep paying an arm and a leg to experience VR without the messy cords .

Virtual reality remains a niche corner of PC gaming , not just because of the sheer cost involved , but also physical issues like annoying cabling running from headset to PC . Fortunately , Intel is on the case with a wireless VR solution for the HTC Vive that it has been showing off over at E3 2017 . Trailing cables represent not just a tripping hazard , but a barrier to immersion , and there are already some wireless solutions for HTC ’ s headset , such as one from TPCast , and another effort which is underway from Quark VR . However , Intel is a far weightier name in the computer world , and the company is promising a slick solution based on DisplayLink XR technology . It recently showed this off at a presentation during Computex , and Intel had a proof of concept unit for folks to have a go with at E3 . One of the obvious potential issues with ditching the cable for a wireless solution is the connection degrading and introducing lag , which is never an acceptable proposition with games – let alone VR games where stuttering could invoke bouts of nausea . Intel ’ s solution uses WiGig ( based on the 802.11ad standard ) working in the 60GHz band to enable a low latency wireless connection from headset to PC , with less than 7ms latency promised at all times ( typical latency will be around 3-5ms , by all accounts ) . And as Engadget writes , the prototype system being shown at E3 never caused gameplay to stutter , whereas the rival TPCast wireless solution did suffer from jerkiness at times , according to the reporter . So that sounds pretty promising , and certainly something to get excited about if you have the Vive headset and have dreamt of a room-scale VR experience free of any concerns about tripping over cables . Apparently the prototype is a bit bulky at this point , but that ’ s not surprising with early versions of hardware , and we can expect it to slim down to something that will hopefully sit atop the user ’ s head in a comfortable and unassuming manner . The DisplayLink XR will be powered by its own small battery , which according to the folks behind the project should be good for two hours of operation . Back at Computex , Intel said that the product would be coming to market early next year . Meanwhile , on the eSports front , Intel is giving VR a big push with its Challenger League .

Gigabyte has shattered some world records for overclocking and benchmarking , after pulling off a rather spectacular overclock on an Intel Core i7-7740K quad-core processor , reaching 7.5GHz using liquid helium cooling . In fact , this was the effort of a team of overclockers led by Gigabyte ’ s own HiCookie , working with the 7740K – one of Intel ’ s beastly new Core X-Series CPUs revealed at Computex – using the firm ’ s own X299-SOC Champion motherboard . As mentioned , they used liquid helium to achieve temperatures of around minus 250 degrees Celsius , allowing the processor to be cranked up to a scarily fast 7.5GHz . The team also managed to post new world records for the 3DMark06 benchmark , with the CPU running at 7.1GHz ( with liquid nitrogen cooling ) in conjunction with an Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Xtreme Edition graphics card , hitting a score of 71,928 ( over 1,000 points clear of the previous record holder ) . Doubling up with a pair of GTX 1080 Ti cards in SLI , they again achieved another global top score – 71,176 . A new Aquamark record was also set ( 737,222 – using a pair of GTX 980 Ti graphics cards ) and a new 3DMark03 high score as well ( 356,678 using a single GTX 1080 Ti ) , again with the CPU at 7.1GHz . It ’ s an impressive set of achievements , then , and bodes well for the overclocking potential of these new Core X offerings , which are headed up by a mighty beast of an 18-core processor ( the flagship Core i9 model ) . A model that just outdoes the new Threadripper top-end CPUs revealed by AMD , the flagship model of which has 16-cores . Speaking of Ryzen , it wasn ’ t so long ago that we saw the initial reveal of the processors , whereupon the Ryzen 7 1800X set new Cinebench records with a liquid nitrogen-driven overclock to 5.2GHz . Of course , these super-cooled overclocks are all well and good , but it ’ ll be more interesting to see how these new Intel models perform when it comes to the sort of turbocharging the average PC owner will apply ( i.e . with air cooling , or perhaps water ) .

You might think all the signs of AMD ’ s rise in the CPU world this year may have cramped Intel ’ s style a bit . But , that was before the latter ’ s most recent financial results , which show the company is making good progress in a PC market which has been slumping for a long time now . For the quarter running up to July , Intel ’ s PC division ( Client Computing Group – which covers everything from desktops through laptops , hybrids and tablets , as well as mobiles ) was up a strong 12 % , raking in $ 8.2 billion ( around £6.3 billion , AU $ 10.3 billion ) for the coffers . Compare that to Gartner ’ s latest figures for the overall PC market , which showed a drop of 4.3 % year-on-year – and the lowest recorded shipment numbers in a decade . Of course , in recent times we ’ ve been hearing a lot about AMD taking back processor market share driven by the popularity of its consumer-targeted Ryzen chips , but it seems that Intel is managing to brush off this assault ( at least for the three months up to and including June ) . And unsurprisingly , Intel is talking up its game going forward , particularly in the enthusiast gaming arena , where the company is investing in both VR and eSports big-time . The firm ’ s VR Challenger League aims to give pro gamers specializing in virtual reality titles a chance to show off their skills and win big . Naturally , there ’ s also the next generation of processors on the near horizon , with Intel claiming 30 % gains on Kaby Lake ( in SYSmark 2014 benchmarking ) . Intel is also continuing to dominate when it comes to flogging chips to the data center market , recording a revenue of $ 4.4 billion ( around £3.4 billion , AU $ 5.5 billion ) , a 9 % increase year-on-year . Incidentally , the firm ’ s total Q2 revenue was $ 14.8 billion ( around £11.3 billion , AU $ 18.6 billion ) which is again a 9 % increase compared to the same period last year , and a new record quarterly revenue . All this paints quite a different picture compared to last year , when Intel made some big cuts in the spring , laying off just over 10 % of its global workforce in restructuring measures . Lest we get too carried away with the trumpet blowing in favor of Intel , we did see earlier this month that the company seems to be at least somewhat worried about AMD ’ s impact with recent advances , at least going by some of the dubious marketing tactics it ’ s engaging in on the server CPU front .

In a freshly-released price list for some of its meaty Core X-Series processors , Intel has revealed some new tech spec info on the Core i9-7920X that ’ s expected to be available next month , including the base clock speed of this 12-core CPU which is pegged at 2.9GHz . This has raised quite a number of eyebrows across the net , mainly because it ’ s surprisingly low – dipping under the 3GHz mark – when compared to both the 10-core 7900X ( which runs at 3.3GHz base ) and in particular the comparable rival Ryzen Threadripper 12-core model ( 1920X ) which has a base clock of 3.5GHz . In other words , these dueling dozen-core offerings have a large gulf of 600MHz between them in AMD ’ s favor , at least when it comes to the base clock . Of course , what Intel hasn ’ t revealed in these pricing details is the Turbo speed of the 7920X . This could potentially be up there with its Ryzen rival which has a boost clock of 4GHz . For example , if we look at the 7900X , as mentioned it has a base speed of 3.3GHz but Turbo to 4.3GHz ( and a single-core boost even further to 4.5GHz ) . The 8-core 7820X is also capable of Turbo to 4.3GHz , from a base clock of 3.6GHz in this case . So without this boost figure , it ’ s impossible to guess exactly how these rival chips will stack up . And even beyond having the core specs , we can ’ t truly judge anything until the Threadripper and Core i9 processors are fully put through their paces by testing and benchmarking . That said , the base clock of 2.9GHz for the 7920X is still a surprising revelation , without a doubt . Whatever the story ends up being in the performance stakes , AMD already appears to have won the battle on the pricing front . While Intel ’ s 7920X will retail at $ 1,189 ( around £920 , AU $ 1,500 ) , the Ryzen Threadripper 1920X is priced at $ 799 ( around £620 , AU $ 1,010 ) . Don ’ t forget that the latter could include a bundled water-cooler , if rumors are correct , meaning far more potential for overclocking this chip into a true Gigahertz monster . Unless Intel has some true architectural magic up its sleeve when it comes to benchmarking time , it ’ s easy to imagine why the company has been getting defensive regarding AMD of late .

AMD has announced the availability and pricing for its beefy enthusiast Ryzen Threadripper CPUs , and at the other end of the scale , wallet-friendly Ryzen 3 desktop processors – all of which will be out within the next month . Two Ryzen Threadripper models are going to be on shelves from early August , and in addition to the previously announced 16-core ( 32-thread ) monster , there will be a 12-core ( 24-thread ) model , with pricing starting at $ 799 ( around £615 , AU $ 1,035 ) for the latter . And the good news for budget CPU fans is that the first pair of Ryzen 3 processors will go on sale come July 27 , just two weeks from today – although the exact pricing hasn ’ t been confirmed in this case . The core specs of the new Threadripper chips are as follows : And the Ryzen 3 chips are as follows : Threadripper runs on the X399 platform and boasts support for quad-channel DDR4 memory , with 64 lanes of PCIe . As AMD demonstrates in the below launch video , the base 12-core model beats out Intel ’ s Core i9-7900X ( 10-core CPU with Turbo to 4.3GHz ) by a score of just over 2,400 to 2,100 in Cinebench R15 . ( The 1950X managed just over 3,000 ) . Intel ’ s i9-7900X is priced at $ 999 ( around £770 , AU $ 1,295 ) , the exact same level that AMD has pitched its flagship 1950X – the latter of which proved almost 50 % quicker in the above benchmark test . In terms of a direct comparison to AMD ’ s Threadripper flagship , Intel ’ s 16-core offering , the i9-7960X , runs to no less than $ 1,699 ( around £1,315 , AU $ 2,200 ) . So this rival chip costs just under 60 % of what Intel is asking . AMD also noted that pre-orders for the Alienware Area 51 Threadripper Edition system will kick-off from July 27 .
As you may be aware , AMD followed up its consumer-targeted Ryzen processors with Epyc CPUs ( previously codenamed Naples ) aimed at servers and data centres – and Intel has been busy slinging mud at the latter chips . In a presentation slide , Intel claims that Epyc processors ( which are based on the same Zen architecture as Ryzen , but go up to a mighty 32-cores ) are ‘ glued-together ’ and a ‘ repurposed desktop product for server ’ . Basically , Intel is saying this is a cobbled together product , along with the glue comment , references the fact that AMD ’ s chips aren ’ t a single die , rather they are comprised of four dies put together . However , this isn ’ t a bad design , as Tech PowerUp , observes . Indeed , the tech site argues that Zen cores were built from the ground-up for modularity and scalability , and to craftily maximise yields for AMD – with the Epyc chips also delivering impressive results on the power/performance front . Intel ’ s slide , however , engages in other seemingly low blows , accusing AMD ’ s processors of having ‘ inconsistent performance ’ due to this ‘ glued-together ’ nature , and further accuses its rival of lacking in terms of its supporting ecosystem . The problem is that making criticisms like these , with broad brush strokes such as vague accusations of inconsistency – as opposed to detailed comparisons or benchmark breakdowns – doesn ’ t really present Intel in a good light . Particularly when in another slide , Intel further has a pop at Epyc CPUs by bringing up Ryzen ’ s initial problems with optimisation for games , and notes that buyers should expect similar software optimisations to be required for the server chips . Which simply doesn ’ t follow . Exactly what does tweaking Ryzen for performance with specific games ( perhaps at certain resolutions ) have to do with what enterprise customers can expect from Epyc ? Again , it just looks like a broad smear tactic . ‘ This happened here , so it ’ s bound to happen again somehow… ’ And this sort of marketing simply makes Intel look worried about the turf it might lose to AMD with these new Zen chips . After all , it appears that Ryzen is already making some considerable inroads into Intel territory with desktop PCs – albeit in terms of enthusiast rigs as these figures indicated earlier this month . Intel may just have shot itself in the foot here – with a glue gun , if we can indulge in a bit of poetic licence , leaving the firm in a somewhat sticky situation regarding the tone of its marketing . It ’ ll certainly be interesting to see if AMD has any response .

There ’ s been an interesting development on the iMac Pro front with Intel ’ s revelation of its full line-up of Xeon server-grade processors from the Purley platform . These new CPUs are rumored to drive the powerful all-in-one , but there doesn ’ t appear to be a top-end CPU in the range which matches the specifications Apple previously stated . Apple said that the iMac Pro would use eight , 10 and 18-core processors with a maximum Turbo speed of up to 4.5GHz , but as Mac Rumors observes , the fastest CPUs in the revealed Purley chips only run up to a Turbo clock of 4.2GHz . Specifically , the quickest chip that matches Apple ’ s mentioned core counts is the Intel Xeon Gold 6144 which is an eight-core CPU with a base clock of 3.5GHz and Turbo to 4.2GHz . So that leaves room for a bit of head scratching here : these Purley processors may be fine for most of the machines in the range , but when it comes to the top-end iMac Pro , what processor is Apple planning to use exactly , given that there is no 4.5GHz model in existence ? Mac Rumors offers up a simple explanation : Intel hasn ’ t announced all its Purley models yet , and there ’ s a beefier one in the pipeline which is destined for the higher-end iMac Pro . We ’ re inclined to agree with this suggestion . The other explanation could be that this is a simple miscommunication between Intel and Apple , or just a plain error by Tim Cook ’ s firm when it came to revealing these details . Although you would hope that wasn ’ t likely , it ’ s not beyond the realms of possibility . It doesn ’ t seem likely that the rumors about Purley are incorrect , given everything else matches up and fits together too neatly – including the iMac Pro ’ s exorbitant cost , plus its launch date of December ( this is likely to be the reason Apple is waiting until the end of the year , rather than bringing the all-in-ones out earlier ) . Ultimately , we have to bear in mind that this is still only a rumor . The Purley speculation emerged a few weeks back , after Pike ’ s Universum did some digging around in the firmware files for the iMac Pro in the latest beta of macOS . According to this rumor , Apple ’ s all-in-one will also have an ARM coprocessor alongside the Purley Xeon CPU , which will be in place to help tighten security on the machine , adding support for a feature known as Apple SecureBoot . A Touch ID fingerprint reader may also be incorporated . All we truly know at this point , however , is the aforementioned core counts Apple has announced , and a few other confirmed pieces of info about the hardware : the iMac Pro will have AMD Radeon Vega graphics , up to 128GB ECC memory and 4TB SSD storage . This helps the machine tol offer 11 teraflops of single precision compute performance .

We finally have a measure of exactly how Ryzen processors have boosted AMD ’ s share of the desktop CPU market , and the new hardware has made quite an impression by snaffling a sizeable chunk of processor territory back from Intel . The latest figures from PassMark for the start of Q3 this year show that AMD has gained 5.2 % , moving up from a market share of 20.6 % the previous quarter , to reach 25.8 % – with that growth trend seemingly set to continue throughout the third quarter . Intel has dropped to 74.2 % in the two-horse race . Of course , we have to bear in mind that the figures are obviously limited to those using the PassMark benchmarking utility – i.e . Windows PCs ( no Mac computers , or indeed other hardware like consoles ) , and moreover , the sort of power users who are likely to be benchmarking their rig . The average consumer likely has little interest in doing this sort of thing , or if they do run the odd benchmark , it ’ ll be using an in-game frame rate counter for their favorite title , as opposed to a dedicated benchmarking suite like PassMark . Still , there ’ s no denying that this seems to represent a major shift in AMD ’ s favor , and one that points to a real positive impact for Ryzen . Furthermore , it ’ s great news in terms of the overall processor market becoming more competitive . Perhaps even better news for AMD is the fact that the company should soon launch its Ryzen 3 processors , the budget end of the range , which could shift even more units and help bolster growth further . With further gains AMD might even start hoping for a return to the heady days of 2005 , when the firm came close to having a 50-50 split with Intel in the CPU market ( that ’ s according to PassMark ’ s figures , of course ) .

Over at IFA 2017 in Berlin , Lenovo has taken the wraps off a trio of Yoga devices , including a new flagship 2-in-1 . That new convertible flagship is the Yoga 920 , which uses a 360-degree hinge just like its predecessor the Yoga 910 , but this latest incarnation of the hybrid juices up things thanks to the inclusion of ( up to ) Core i7 quad-core CPUs from Intel ’ s new range of 8th-generation chips . Connectivity has been improved with a pair of USB Type-C ( Thunderbolt 3 ) ports , and the new hybrid is very slightly slimmer at 13.95mm ( compared to 14.3mm for the Yoga 910 ) . Lenovo ’ s Yoga 920 also gets better support for Cortana on Windows 10 , with far-field microphones that can recognize and process voice commands from up to four meters away . That means you can call out to the laptop from across the room ( even when it ’ s in standby mode ) and Microsoft ’ s digital assistant will spring into action . As with the previous model , this convertible has a near-edgeless ( i.e . very thin bezels ) 13.9-inch IPS touchscreen which can be configured as Full HD or UHD resolution ( the latter is 3,840 x 2,160-pixels ) . It also still has a fingerprint sensor on board for secure logins , and can be configured with either 8GB or 16GB of system memory , with storage options running up to a 1TB PCIe SSD . The Yoga 920 can optionally be bundled with Lenovo ’ s Active Pen 2 for Windows Ink duties , and the metal chassis comes in platinum , copper or bronze colors . There are also some limited edition Star Wars-themed Gorilla Glass cover designs , namely the Special Edition Yoga 920 Rebel Alliance and Yoga 920 Galactic Empire . Lenovo ’ s Yoga 920 will start at $ 1,329 ( around £1,030 , AU $ 1,680 ) and it ’ ll be available come October . Lenovo also unveiled the Yoga 720 ( 12-inch ) , a more wallet-friendly convertible ( pictured above ) which runs with a 12.5-inch Full HD IPS screen , so it ’ s a slightly more compact effort than the existing smallest variant of the Yoga 720 ( which has a 13.3-inch display ) . This hybrid also has a 360-degree hinge and weighs in at just 1.15kg . Unfortunately it uses last generation Intel Kaby Lake processors ( up to Core i7 ) , with up to 8GB of system RAM and 512GB SSD storage . You also get a USB Type-C port ( along with one USB 3.0 connector ) , a backlit keyboard , fingerprint reader , and a claimed battery life of up to eight hours . Lenovo ’ s new Yoga 720 will start at $ 650 ( around £500 , AU $ 820 ) and also goes on sale in October . Finally , Lenovo gave us a look at the new Miix 520 , a 12.2-inch detachable ( meaning that the display comes away from the keyboard completely ) . As with the Yoga 920 , the Miix 520 gets an impressive power boost from Intel ’ s latest 8th-generation processors . In this case , the tablet is upgradable to a quad-core Core i5 CPU . The Miix 520 also has far-field microphones to allow for the usage of Cortana at a distance of up to four meters . This 2-in-1 further benefits from a WorldView camera which can be used to capture images of real-life objects and then edit them in 3D ( or use them for 3D printing applications ) . Plus the Miix 520 offers optional LTE connectivity for when you ’ re on the move . Just like the other hybrids , Lenovo ’ s Miix 520 will be out in October , priced at $ 999 ( around £770 , AU $ 1,260 ) . Unlike the Surface Pro , though , this tablet includes the detachable keyboard and a bundled Lenovo Active Pen 2 .

Update : Dell has provided us with more information about the Dell XPS 13 's price and availability in the UK . The latest incarnation of the much-liked Dell XPS 13 has shown its face over at the IFA show in Germany , with the new model being powered by Intel ’ s latest generation of CPUs . Yes , the new XPS 13 can be kitted out with an 8th-generation Core processor – up to a Core i7 8550U running at up to 4GHz – with the quad-core chip being bolstered by Dell ’ s ‘ dynamic power mode ’ that ’ s designed to squeeze out extra performance while guarding against overheating . Indeed , the laptop vendor claims that this new 8th-gen CPU ( combined with the power mode ) offers no less than a 44 % performance boost over what Dell describes as ‘ similarly configured systems ’ running Kaby Lake processors ( based on the SYSmark 2014 SE benchmark ) . A lofty promise indeed… The notebook can be configured with up to 16GB system memory and an SSD of up to 1TB in size . The XPS 13 remains the same impressive feat of laptop engineering in terms of cramming a 13.3-inch display into an 11-inch chassis , and the new model retains the same slim profile and light weight as its predecessor . Dell proposes users will have up to 22 hours of battery life in the case of the Full HD display ( as was the case previously , the notebook can alternatively be configured with a 3,200 x 1,800-resolution screen , but that obviously has more of a hit on the battery ) . Dell ’ s refreshed XPS 13 will be available on September 12 in the US with prices starting at $ 799 ( around AU $ 1,000 ) . However , in the UK , the company has said that only the 8th-gen Intel Core i7 model will go on sale on that date priced £1,199 – but additional ( doubtless cheaper ) configurations will be available in October . Dell has also wheeled out a clutch of new notebooks in the Inspiron 7000 series , headed up by a new Inspiron 17 7000 hybrid , alongside the Inspiron 13 and 15 7000 2-in-1s ( all of which utilize a 360-degree hinge ) . All of these machines have also adopted Intel ’ s new 8th-gen processors ( again , up to a Core i7 8550U ) for a nice boost in speed , and you can double-down on that nippier performance by plumping to add Intel Optane Memory into the mix ( although the latter won ’ t be an option until early next year ) . The Inspiron 17 comes with a 17.3-inch Full HD resolution touchscreen , with up to 16GB of system RAM , and Nvidia GeForce MX150 ( Pascal ) graphics with 2GB of video memory . With the Inspiron 13 and 15 , you can opt for a Full HD IPS touchscreen – or in the case of the 15-inch model crank it up to a 4K resolution display – with an Nvidia GeForce 940MX GPU running the graphics show . You can expect to see these hybrids come October 3 with the 13-inch model starting at $ 899 ( around £700 , AU $ 1,130 ) and the 15-inch model at $ 849 ( around £660 , AU $ 1,070 ) , meanwhile the 17-inch hybrid weighing in at $ 940 ( around £740 , AU $ 1,200 ) .

Intel just launched its 8th-generation processors for laptops , known as Kaby Lake Refresh , but there was n't any mention of desktop CPUs . However , thanks to a new leak , it seems that these PC-bound chips will indeed require a new motherboard as previous speculation had indicated . This information comes courtesy of leaked box shots of Core i5 and i7 models , and as PC Gamer reports , on the side of the product box you can clearly see the following line : “ Requires Intel 300 series chipset-based motherboard ” . There ’ s no real danger that these are photo-shopped images , apparently , as other sources across the net have noted that these are legitimate pics accidentally spilled by Intel . And this confirms what motherboard manufacturer ASRock already stated on Twitter at the beginning of the month – if you want an 8th-generation desktop CPU , you ’ ll need a new 300-series motherboard . The beefy new processors won ’ t be compatible with existing 200-series motherboards because even though they use the same LGA 1151 socket , they ’ ll require a slightly modified ‘ version 2 ’ socket ( allegedly with minor differences in the pin configuration ) . That means those wishing to upgrade will need to buy a whole new motherboard for their shiny new CPU , which is obviously an extra expense and more of a hassle than simply dropping in a fresh chip . As we ’ ve said before , the danger here is that if upgraders are having to go the whole hog to switch out all that hardware , they may potentially look at jumping ship to a new AMD motherboard and Ryzen CPU . These incoming 8th-gen processors are rumored to be the stomping ground where Intel will finally usher six-core CPUs into its mainstream offerings ( as opposed to enthusiast chips with hefty price tags ) .

We ’ ve been expecting Intel to unveil its Coffee Lake processors for the longest time , but the chipmaker has just announced that its 8th-generation CPUs will actually be a major Kaby Lake overhaul , and named Kaby Lake Refresh . Before you get too disappointed though , this tick-tock-tock update is bringing some big developments , including some of the first quad-core U-series processors . Intel 's latest batch of Core i5 and i7 CPUs destined for Ultrabooks will see a doubling of core and thread counts . Additionally , 8th-generation Intel Core processors introduce Intel UHD Graphics , allowing laptops to better handle 4K content purely on Integrated graphics . This new form of on-board graphics will also allow users to connect their Ultrabooks to up to three Ultra HD displays at the same time and power Windows Mixed Reality experiences – though Ultra-level experiences will still require dedicated graphics . Intel claims users should see up to a 40 % performance boost over its last generation of processors . According to the company , the Kaby Lake Refresh brings a two-times increase in both productivity performance and web performance . Users can supposedly expect to render a 4K video in just three minutes and edit photos in Lightroom up to 28 % faster than with 7th-generation Kaby Lake chips – we ’ ll have to see if those figures are borne out in real-world use . The Kaby Lake Refresh is built on Intel 's 14nm Plus architecture , and while it doesn ’ t come with a decrease in die size , the company has made plenty of power management tweaks to improve both performance and battery life . In fact , Intel sees up to 10 hours of battery life on devices with sleek designs . Intel ’ s 8th-generation architecture will also bring Optane memory support to laptops , which should be a big boon to budget notebooks equipped with only a hard drive for storage . Meanwhile , Intel Online Connect extends fingerprint authentication to a touch-to-pay system – similar to Touch ID on MacBook Pros – and two-factor authentication . Thus far , Intel has only officially announced four Intel Core i7 chips , but the chipmaker promises it 's working with hardware manufacturers to bring 145 laptop designs by September . Later this year and moving into next year we ’ re likely – given the history of Kaby Lake 's rollout – to see a whole new line of Y-Series chips for fanless and ultrathin systems or K-series for gaming laptops and workstations . Of course , a new slew of desktop chips is surely on the way and could bring their own increase in cores .

Intel is evangelizing its 8th-generation Core i series with reckless abandon , most recently detailing the upcoming desktop chip line to Chinese manufacturing partners in a private session it had to know would inevitably leak online . Just ahead of an August 21 official reveal , the leak comes courtesy of a photo from the session posted on a Chinese computing forum known as ChipHell , later picked up by none other than Anandtech before the post was removed from the forum . As per the leaked photo , Intel ’ s desktop processors – from Core i3-8100 to Core i7-8700K – will enjoy increases in core count by 100 % and 50 % , respectively . Specifically , 8th generation Intel Core i3 processors will be quad-core by default , meanwhile both Core i5 and Core i7 chips will be hexa-core standard . However , the devil is in the details here , unsurprisingly . While Intel is upping the core count of every tier of Core i processor , the firm is removing hyper-threading from the i3 line in comparison to last generation ’ s product , and not bringing it to the i5 line – on par with last year . Of course , the i7 line ’ s hyper-threading remains untouched , for such a move would likely be deemed treason by the enthusiast community . Otherwise , it seems the Core i3 line is enjoying the most changes , with the i3-8100 and i3-8350K seeing a considerable bump in TDP , or thermal design power , to 65 watts and 95W , respectively . ( Last year ’ s were 51W and 60W , respectively . ) This is to be expected given the doubling of cores , and makes the TDP offerings of every tier much more uniform than before . Across the board , all three tiers of Core i desktop chips will receive a boost in L3 memory cache , too , to the tune of 6MB , 9MB and 12MB going from Core i3 up to Core i7 . That said , this leak still doesn ’ t tell us some of the base and turbo frequencies of the processors , but expect these clock speeds to drop a few hundred megahertz year-on-year across the board given the bumps in core counts . The leaked photo also makes no mention of the graphics platform found within these new processors , an important element given AMD ’ s focus on GPU compute – or utilizing graphics processing cores for general computing tasks . Finally , we still have no idea how much these chips are going to cost , if at all different from last generation ’ s pricing . That said , with AMD 's effect on the processor market , we could well be paying less for the highest-end , 8th-generation Intel desktop processor . Boy , can that total eclipse not come soon enough or what ?

Intel has spilled the first official ( though admittedly scant ) details on a future generation of processors that will be known as Ice Lake , and which will utilize a 10nm+ process in their manufacturing . As you may be aware , Intel has the big reveal of its Coffee Lake CPUs – the eighth generation of the Core family , following on from Kaby Lake – planned for next Monday . This will be the fourth iteration of 14nm processors , and effectively a second optimization phase for this technology , with Intel promising chips which are between 15 % to 30 % faster than Kaby Lake . Next in line will be Cannon Lake , which will be the first time Intel drops to 10nm , a smaller process meaning that more transistors can be packed into the compact square which is a CPU – and therefore more power ( and indeed there are guaranteed to be power efficiency improvements , and that ’ s almost more important than outright performance in these days of increasingly mobile computing ) . Then we ’ ll see Ice Lake , which Intel boasted will have `` amazing performance and responsiveness '' , further noting that : `` The Ice Lake processor family is a successor to the 8th generation Intel Core processor family . These processors utilize Intel ’ s industry-leading 10nm+ process technology . '' That mention of 10nm+ means this will be the first step on from Cannon Lake , with Intel working to refine the architecture to gain further improvements over the smaller 10nm process . ( Intel works on what ’ s known as a process-architecture-optimization model , which means that it invents a new process , refines it with a new microarchitecture , and then implements further optimization on top – then rinses and repeats ) . But what this will actually mean in practical terms when we arrive at Ice Lake is obviously far from clear at the moment . The CPUs are still well in the future , and quite possibly won ’ t arrive until 2019 , as the Motley Fool reports ( or possibly later next year if we ’ re lucky ) . If we were going to indulge in a spot of wild speculation – and why not ? – it did pop into our heads that maybe Ice Lake could be a reference to some seriously cool running for these chips , so perhaps they ’ ll boast beefy power-efficiency and thermal improvements . Meanwhile , we might hear some further news regarding the future of Intel CPUs at next week ’ s Coffee Lake extravaganza , although the focus will naturally be on the new eighth-generation processors .

On the day of the great solar eclipse across the US , Intel will show Coffee Lake , it ’ s 8th generation of Core series processors , to the world . That ’ s right , on August 21 , when the sun and moon will throw immense shade upon the US for but a few moments , Intel will throw its own shade at AMD Ryzen with its latest CPUs . This was no coincidence . On August 21 , Intel will livestream the festivities on both its own newsroom page as well as Facebook starting at 8am PT ( 11am ET , 5pm BT ) or 1am AEST on August 22 . In the same breath , Intel let loose some key details regarding its plans for the big Coffee Lake reveal , namely that we ’ ll also see brand new PC designs based on the new processors as well as a sneak peek at new standalone devices using the new chips . Finally , Intel teases that folks will be able to buy Coffee Lake chips in addition to devices housing them before the holiday shopping season hits – ahem , like Black Friday ? Beyond that , all we know about Coffee Lake so far is that these chips will be produced using the same 14-nanometer fabrication process , the fourth time now consecutively . Intel has also publicly claimed that these processors will be 15 % to 30 % faster than the previous generation despite using the same amount of transistors as before . That could be due to rumored quad-core versions of Core i3 chips and hexa-core makes of chips beyond that class in mainstream offerings . Oh , and you 'll likely need a new motherboard for these Coffee Lake chips . As for what this means for AMD ’ s Ryzen , well , it would be smart for Intel to ramp up the core counts across its Coffee Lake lineup if only to maintain parity with its key rival . This is where we could see Intel wrangle hold again of the top spot in terms of power and efficiency in the low-end and mid-range ends of the CPU spectrum . However , as we ’ ve seen with pricing of Ryzen versus that of Intel ’ s latest Kaby Lake chips , that facet of the ongoing battle is , as always , up in the air . Be sure to join us on August 21 for the latest news and our hot takes , as that Monday just got a major upgrade .

Hot on the trail of the release of our first AMD Ryzen Threadripper benchmark results , Intel is firing back with the full specifications of its 18-core Extreme Edition processor . The Intel Core i9-7980XE Extreme Edition CPU is the company ’ s top of the line CPU that will feature 18-cores and 36-threads , with a base frequency of 2.6GHz that clocks up to 4.2GHz through Turbo Boost 2.0 . Using TurboBoost 3.0 to specifically overclock the two fastest cores on the processor will see the Core i9-7980XE reach speeds of 4.4GHz . Intel is clearly putting forth its Extreme Edition processor to be a direct competitor to the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X , which comes with 16-cores , 32-threads and base/boost clock speeds of 3.4GHz/4.0GHz . While it might seem like Intel ’ s chip is slower , the Core i9-7980XE has two more cores over it while being 15-watts less power hungry . When paired with the upcoming X299 chipset , Intel also sees an advantage of four more PCIe lanes compared to the 64 PCIe lanes on AMD ’ s X399 chipset . Beyond its top of the line 18-core CPU , Intel also release the specifications of its 12- , 14- and 16-core processors that feature fewer cores , but support higher frequencies . The 12-core Intel Core X-series processor will be available starting on August 28th . Meanwhile , the 14- to 18-core Intel Core X-series processors will begin shipping on September 25th . Price is traditionally where AMD has the advantage on Intel , and it seems like that is still the case , with the 16-core i9-7960X going for $ 1,699 ( around £1,300 , AU $ 2150 ) , while Threadripper 's 16-core version will be $ 999 ( around £770 , AU $ 1,295 ) - quite a bit cheaper . Meanwhile , the 18-core Intel i9-7980XE will sell for $ 1,999 ( around £1,500 , AU $ 2,500 ) .

It seems that people who are looking forward to getting themselves a ( rumored ) mainstream processor with six-cores from Intel , courtesy of the incoming next-gen Coffee Lake CPUs , won ’ t be able to drop the chip straight into their existing motherboard – they ’ ll need to buy an entirely new one . The bad news for those mulling a processor upgrade to Coffee Lake came via Twitter from motherboard manufacturer ASRock , in a tweet which appears to have subsequently been pulled down . As Wccftech.com spotted , a customer queried whether these new CPUs would be compatible with an existing 200-series ASRock motherboard , and the company replied : “ Coffee Lake CPU is not compatible with 200 series motherboards . ” Short and to the point . This is despite the fact that Coffee Lake chips are said to use the LGA 1151 socket as found on the 200-series motherboards . According to Wccftech , the reason for the lack of support for the new processors is that they will effectively require an LGA 1151 socket ‘ version 2 ’ with a slightly different pin configuration . While this can ’ t be taken as gospel at this point , we have seen a couple of other reports around the net citing sources confirming that Intel ’ s eighth-generation CPUs won ’ t play nice with existing 200-series mobos . So we can ’ t jump to conclusions yet , but it ’ s not looking good for potential upgraders right now . We guess if this is true , the danger for Intel is that disgruntled folks looking at having to buy a new motherboard along with their Coffee Lake CPU might just take the opportunity to evaluate transferring to a fresh AMD motherboard and Ryzen multi-core processor – seeing as they ’ re going to have to make a big change to their PC anyway . And any temptation might be made considerably stronger by AMD ’ s highly competitive pricing in the processor world .

Intel ’ s new monster Core i9 processors boasting 18-cores and 16-cores have just gone on sale , and Asus has set some blistering new records overclocking these CPUs with its ROG Rampage VI Apex motherboard . Using the Core i9-7980XE 18-core processor ( with a base clock of 2.6GHz , Turbo to 4.2GHz ) cooled with liquid nitrogen to around -100°C , expert ROG overclocker ‘ der8auer ’ managed to push the chip to 6.104GHz across all 18 cores ( at 1.55V ) . All without the CPU being reduced to a melted pile of goop , although the system wasn ’ t stable enough to run benchmarks at this speed . To get some testing done , things had to be toned down to 5.6GHz with a voltage of 1.45V , at which point the multi-threaded Cinebench R15 benchmark could be run – Asus notes that there was almost 1000W coursing through the system . The Cinebench R15 CPU score notched up was 5,635 , a mind-boggling figure when you consider it almost doubled the previous record of 2,990 ( another overclocker , ‘ elmor ’ , pushed the chip even further to set a new record of 5,723 ) . New records were also achieved in 3DMark Vantage 2x with the CPU at 5.66GHz , with Italian overclocker ‘ Rsannino ’ achieving a score of 138,185 ( compared to the previous record of 135,813 ) . He further blew away the Geekbench3 multi-core record – which stood at 48,004 – with a score of 92,307 , again a massive leap . Furthermore , Rsannino clocked the Core i9-7940X ( with 14-cores , base clock 3.1GHz ) up to 5.7GHz , and again set a new Cinebench R15 record ( 4,339 compared to the previous 2,424 ) along with Geekbench3 multi-core ( 70,618 eclipsing the previous record of 40,155 ) . A load of other new highs were reached , and you can see the full list of benchmark records in this Asus article . As ever , these sort of liquid nitrogen shenanigans are a far-cry from real-world overclocking and performance , but you can still gauge the relative power of Intel ’ s new monster processors in terms of how much they blew away the previous ( equally super-cooled ) records . Of course , should you be tempted to invest in Intel ’ s flagship 18-core CPU , you ’ ll need deep pockets as it retails at $ 1,999 ( about £1,480 , AU $ 2,510 ) , but it is exceptionally powerful , as these benchmarks illustrate – and as we found out in our full review . However , it costs twice as much as AMD ’ s 16-core Ryzen Threadripper 1950X .

Intel has revealed its 8th-generation Core processors ( Coffee Lake S ) for the desktop which will go on sale come October 5 , including new mainstream Core i5 CPUs which run with six-cores ( for the first time ever ) , and a Core i7 model which the company says is the best gaming processor it has ever produced . The latter is the Core i7-8700K which is capable of turbo boosting to 4.7GHz out of the box ( via Turbo Boost 2.0 ) . This is a six-core ( 12-thread ) CPU with a base clock of 3.7GHz and 12MB of cache ( it ’ s also unlocked for overclocking , as the ‘ K ’ denotes ) . It has a TDP of 95W . In comparison to its Kaby Lake predecessor , the i7-7700K ( quad-core ) , Intel claims that it can achieve up to 25 % more frames per second in Gears of War 4 . And under PlayerUnknown ’ s Battlegrounds , when gaming , streaming and recording ( i.e . under very heavy load ) , the new chip is up to a whopping 45 % faster than its predecessor . The new i7-8700K will come with a suggested price of $ 359 ( £265 , AU $ 450 ) , and there ’ s also a Core i7-8700 ( non-overclocking ) version with a lower base clock of 3.2GHz and turbo to 4.6GHz ( and a TDP of 65W ) which will weigh in at $ 303 ( £225 , AU $ 380 ) . Moving on to the new Core i5 offerings , these are both six-core , six-thread models , led by the Core i5-8600K which has a base clock of 3.6GHz and turbo to 4.3GHz , with 9MB of cache and a TDP of 95W . Intel has priced this chip at $ 257 ( £190 , AU $ 325 ) . That ’ s backed up by the Core i5-8400 which drops the base clock to 2.8GHz with boost to 4GHz and a lower TDP of 65W . This will be pitched at $ 182 ( £135 , AU $ 230 ) . As well as the Core i5 stepping things up to six-cores ( from quad-core ) , there ’ s been movement with the entry-level Core i3 CPUs which are now quad-core ( as opposed to their predecessors which were dual-core ) . Intel has introduced a pair of new quad-core ( four-thread ) processors led by the Core i3-8350K which has a base clock of 4GHz , 6MB of cache and a TDP of 91W . It ’ s followed by the Core i3-8100 which lowers the base clock to 3.6GHz and TDP to 65W ( there ’ s no boost with these chips ) . These will be priced at $ 168 ( £125 , AU $ 210 ) and $ 117 ( £85 , AU $ 145 ) respectively . Intel is also promising better overclocking from the unlocked 8th-gen CPUs which will offer per-core overclocking and other goodies including real-time memory latency control and extended PLL trim controls . As previously rumored , all these processors will need a new motherboard using Intel ’ s Z370 chipset , which the company notes provides the ‘ improved power delivery ’ necessary for the six-core processors to achieve their optimum performance levels . So if you want one of these new chips , you ’ ll also need to buy a new motherboard . These processors will be available from next Thursday , so there ’ s not long to wait now if you want to make the move to a relatively affordable six-core chip with Intel . Of course , this latest generation of processors pushing the boat out in terms of cores seems like a natural move from Intel , given how far AMD has been driving ahead with multi-core Ryzen CPUs .

No VR system is perfect . PC VR relies upon you buying an expensive headset to sit alongside your already expensive computer , while mobile VR makes use of the hardware you already have in your phone while being limited by that same hardware . Intel 's new system wants to combine the benefits of the two in order to overcome the disadvantages by streaming VR content from a powerful PC to a mobile phone acting as a headset . Called 'Portal Ridge ' , the system makes use of existing hardware from HTC including its Vive controllers , basestations , and a Vive tracker ( to track the position of the headset ) to combine the benefits of a gaming PC and your mobile . At an event in San Francisco , Intel demoed the system working with a Google Pixel phone . Visual data was streamed over Wi-Fi , and first hand reports from RoadtoVR suggest that this has lead to a certain amount of compression visible in the image . Latency is also apparently a problem with the system . Although the system is clearly a work in progress , it is an interesting look at how consumer 's existing hardware could be made to work with VR rather than having to buy entirely new equipment . Intel has no plans to commercially release the technology at this time , but has said that it 's open to working with partners to produce it in the future .

Intel is once again experiencing trouble with its next-generation , 10-nanometer processors – codenamed Cannon Lake – pushing their release back to late 2018 , Digitimes reports . This is far from the first time that Intel ’ s Cannon Lake processors have reportedly run into setbacks , first set to release in 2017 . According to Digitimes ’ s supply chain sources , which appear to have been accurate up to now regarding Intel 's movements , this would be the third time that the Cannon Lake will have been pushed back . First , they were pushed to the end of 2017 or early next year , then to mid-2018 and now to the end of next year . Cannon Lake is expected to see considerable gains in performance ( 25 % ) and reductions in power consumption ( 45 % ) , thanks to shrinking the transistor size from 14nm – where Intel ’ s processors are now and have been since its first Core M chips in 2014 – to 10nm . However , the firm clearly has experienced trouble fabricating the teeny transistors at a mass scale . That is , so as to reliably produce enough of the chips to then sell to its numerous device-making partners , like Dell , HP and Apple , to name a few . Since most device vendors start preparing to manufacture their next generation of products a year in advance , several said companies have likely already begun placing orders with Intel for their 2018 line of products . With that in mind , it ’ s likely that vendors will have to rework their plans for devices due to release in that calendar year . One in particular that ’ s likely to sting especially hard is the hotly anticipated 2018 MacBook Pro with 32GB of memory , or RAM . That ’ s because Cannon Lake is the processor generation expected to support up to 32GB of RAM natively , through the LPDDR4 standard , or without a dedicated memory controller . Since Apple isn ’ t expected to include such a part in its MacBook Pro anytime soon , as least by Apple Insider ’ s estimation , we probably won ’ t see a Mac laptop with such capacious RAM until sometime in 2019 . That said , we have seen Intel ’ s mobile processors increase in core count across the board with the onset of this year ’ s 8th generation , Kaby Lake Refresh , which would at least enable the first-ever quad-core MacBook Pro in 2018 . Still , you probably won ’ t get those gobs of RAM next year .

Editor 's Note : The original version of this article incorrectly intimated that Intel eliminated all of its WiGig products , when only products supporting previous CPU architectures ( Broadwell , Skylake , et al ) were put on EOL programs . Intel has provided the following statement to clarify : “ We continue to offer current versions of our 802.11ad products , such as the Intel Tri-band Wireless AC 18265 and Gigabit Wireless 10101R antenna module . We remain committed to WiGig and think it has exciting potential for a number of applications , including enabling VR to become wireless , mesh networking and as part of Intel ’ s leading products for 5G . ” Original article follows ... Intel has officially killed its WiGig line of products in favor of dedicating the wireless connectivity technology to virtual reality ( VR ) headsets , Anandtech reports . This means that Intel will soon no longer sell 802.11d radio cards , antennae and sinks , with End of Life ( EOL ) programs in place for each . Shipments of these parts will stop before the end of 2017 , December 29 to be exact . Such a short EOL plan indicates that the products weren ’ t very popular to begin with . Regardless , Intel intends to support the WiGig products it has already shipped for the foreseeable future . For those out of the loop , WiGig is Intel ’ s fancy name for the short-range 802.11d connectivity standard , which operates over the 60GHz frequency . The technology allows for wireless docking and connectivity of devices with speeds that come close to that of USB 3.1 Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 hard line connections . However , being a short-range signal , WiGig requires connected devices to be awfully close and unimpeded by physical objects , like walls or floors . When you can get faster and more reliable connectivity from a hard-line Thunderbolt 3 connection , the point becomes rather moot . That said , Intel apparently sees great value in applying 802.11d or WiGig technology in wireless connectivity modules for VR headsets . Given how VR on PCs and game consoles , like the PS4 , works , it ’ s easy to see why the firm is so bullish on this application of the tech . ( That is , not to mention rivals like TPCast and DisplayLink – seen above – already working on similar add-on devices for VR headsets . ) In fact , Intel has already struck up a partnership with HTC to craft such a device for its headsets that should eliminate the need for wires to deliver the visuals and other data from the PC in question to , say , the HTC Vive headset . The end result , in theory , would be greater freedom ( within a certain range ) for the VR user and no more worry of tripping over wires . All in all , Intel is still being mum on the specifics regarding how it will implement WiGig technology into partners ’ VR headsets , specifically whether it ’ s using off-the-shelf technology or more finely-developed applications of the technology that will come through via brand new products . Considering that Intel is a company that makes money off of selling things to the public and manufacturing partners , we ’ re willing to bet on the latter being the case . This news also doesn ’ t account for Facebook ’ s own wireless VR headset in the works , the Santa Cruz prototype , which seems to use entirely proprietary technology to the same end . If you thought 2016 was the year of VR , just you wait for 2018 .

More evidence has emerged of how well AMD ’ s Ryzen line of processors are chipping away at Intel ’ s dominance of the CPU market . The new confirmation of AMD ’ s rise comes from German retailer Mindfactory.de , which has released its CPU sales data ( which were then picked up on Reddit ) for the period between March and August 2017 . Back in March , AMD CPUs accounted for just 27.6 % of the retailer 's CPU sales , compared to 72.4 % for Intel . However , in April after the Ryzen 7 1800X , 1700X and 1700 had launched , and which saw the introduction of the mid-range Ryzen 5 chips , AMD ’ s share rose to 36.5 % while Intel ’ s dropped to 63.5 % . This pattern of AMD clawing back market share from Intel is repeated throughout the year , and in August 2017 AMD actually overtook Intel – 56.1 % to 43.9 % . That ’ s a remarkable turnaround from the start of the year . Of course , this is just data from a single retailer in one country , but such a huge swing in AMD ’ s favor means it ’ s very likely that we ’ ll see an overall shift to AMD , though maybe not quite so pronounced . It ’ s also worth noting that Germany is a very big market for PC components , so even with this limited data , AMD must be feeling pretty happy right now – and Intel feeling a bit nervous . AMD will reveal its quarterly results in the next month or so , which should give us a better idea of how its doing . As for Intel , this may be a wake up call that AMD ’ s aim of offering high core and thread counts at very competitive prices is doing real damage to their market share . Could we see more competitive prices from Intel in the future ? We certainly hope so .

Intel has introduced a new Optane SSD 900P line of blisteringly fast solid-state storage drives . Not to be confused with Intel Optane memory , these are bonified SSD drives with sequential read speed rating of 2,500MB/s and a sequential write speed of 2,000MB/s . While that 's not nearly as fast as the 3,500MB/s read and 2,100MB/s write speeds seen on top consumer SSDs like the Samsung 960 Pro-series , the Intel Optane SSD 900P-series is designed for extremely demanding workstation workloads . These would include 3D rendering , complex simulations and fast game load times . Intel claims its latest product was able to cut down the rendering time of a 7-second clip filled with 1.1 billion particles down from 17.4 hours to 6.3 hours . To achieve this level of performance , Intel explained it used 3D XPoint memory rather than traditional NAND memory seen in most SSDs . However , since the Intel Optane SSD 900P line is focused on reliability , they don ’ t offer much in terms of capacity . Initially , Intel is only offering its latest solid-state drives in 280GB and 480GB capacities . These Intel Optane SSD 900P drives also come at eye-watering prices , with the PCIe x4 Gen 3 versions costing $ 389 ( about £300 , AU $ 510 ) for an 280GB drive and $ 699 ( about £530 , AU $ 910 ) for the 480GB version . There ’ s also a 2.5-inch 280GB U.2 drive priced at $ 389 ( about £300 , AU $ 510 ) . Although this SSD is aimed at the commercial and enterprise market , consumers can buy into these blisteringly fast SSDs . It ’ s no coincidence that Intel demoded the Optane SSD 900P-series with the game Star Citizen when it was announced at CitizenCon in Frankfurt , Germany . Intel Optane SSD 900P drives will be available starting on October 27 .
Intel has revealed its latest financial results with an impressive picture of growth that beat analyst estimates , although there was one wobbly area , namely desktop chips , where AMD ’ s Ryzen CPUs have made a clearly visible dent in Intel ’ s armor . Overall , Intel raked in revenue of $ 16.1 billion ( around £12.2 billion , AU $ 21 billion ) for Q3 which was up 6 % compared to the previous year , with a net income of $ 4.5 billion ( around £3.4 billion , AU $ 5.9 billion ) which represented a strong increase of 34 % year-on-year . And here comes the ‘ but ’ – desktop chip sales dropped by 6 % , and it ’ s not hard to guess why , particularly when you look at AMD ’ s third quarter results as we did yesterday . AMD announced that its computing and graphics group ( Ryzen and Radeon ) secured revenues of $ 819 million ( around £620 million , AU $ 1.05 billion ) , which was up a massive 74 % on the previous year . Meanwhile , Intel ’ s client computing group ( desktop and notebook chips , along with mobile devices , and wireless chips ) saw its revenue remain flat , with no growth , whereas all other groups showed strong double-digit revenue growth ( except data centers , which was up 7 % ) . The IoT group was up 23 % and Intel ’ s non-volatile memory solutions group shifted up several gears with 37 % growth . This is , essentially , the other piece of the jigsaw showing that AMD is plowing ahead in the processor arena thanks to Ryzen . AMD ’ s CEO even said that at some online retailers , Ryzen desktop CPUs accounted for around 40-50 % of sales ; effectively almost pulling level with Intel . So perhaps it isn ’ t surprising that Intel has been firing marketing flak at AMD over the course of this year . That said , Intel does have a potential ace emerging from its sleeve in the form of new Coffee Lake desktop CPUs which bring six-core desktop chips into the mainstream for the first time , in an obvious effort to battle Ryzen ’ s impressive core counts . Coffee Lake officially went on sale this month , and while you can purchase a processor if you hunt around online , there appear to be considerable stock issues , with some major retailers not showing availability until the beginning of next month . AMD is also predicting that its growth will slow down thanks to a forecasted diminishing demand for cryptocurrency mining GPUs , and all this could add up to a swing back in Intel ’ s favor in the overall financial picture . The good thing is , whichever way you look at it , the processor market is clearly becoming a far more competitive place , and that has to be good news for the consumer on the hunt for keenly priced CPUs .

Intel could be about to produce a mobile CPU which uses AMD ’ s Vega graphics technology , according to the rumor mill . This speculation stems from a leaked Intel slide posted by Wccftech with a caption that reads ‘ Vega Inside , Mobile Performance Outside ’ suggesting that we could see a mobile processor which has , well , Vega graphics inside . First off , note that this potential move has to be taken with a truck-load of salt , but the theory is that Intel might look to incorporate AMD ’ s Vega tech with either Coffee Lake-H – the next series of mobile processors following on from the current 8th-gen ( Kaby Lake Refresh ) models – or Cannon Lake-Y CPUs ( due later in 2018 ) which are truly next-gen as this architecture marks the shift to 10nm . The latter would seem more likely , purely in terms of timeframe if nothing else , but of course this is all pure speculation . The leaked slide could even simply refer to discrete Vega graphics in Intel-powered notebooks , although the way the caption is worded doesn ’ t suggest that , and certainly makes it sound like integrated AMD graphics . Wccftech suggests that Intel could plump for an on-die MCM chip design utilizing a multi-die interconnect bridge to allow for a high-bandwidth connection to the GPU , particularly as this is technology Intel talked up in a recent keynote . Adding further weight to this rumor is the fact that we ’ ve previously heard speculation along these lines ; there was talk of the prospect of ‘ Intel Radeon graphics ’ last summer . And this move certainly seems like a good way for Intel to juice up its mobile processors in terms of their raw pixel shifting power , providing a lid can be kept on any thermal issues ( i.e . overheating , which is an ever-present problem when it comes to cramming more powerful components into laptops ) . All that said , we have to be realistic at this point , and bear in mind that this leak does look rather sketchy , being based off a single rather blurry slide . Meanwhile , it shouldn ’ t be long before we see Ryzen mobile CPUs with integrated Radeon Vega graphics , so we can get an idea of how powerful these might be – although benchmarks have already been leaked on that score .

Intel ’ s next-generation mainstream flagship processor will be a Core i7 CPU that sports no less than 8-cores with 16-threads , according to the latest from the rumor mill . According to recent leaks , as reported by Wccftech.com , the 9th-generation flagship processor will be the Core i7-9700K which will up the ante to 8-cores from 6-cores ( as seen in the current Coffee Lake flagship Core i7-8700K ) . There isn ’ t any speculation regarding the other specs such as clock speeds or TDP , although Wccftech.com speculates that the 9th-gen processors will use a honed version of the current 14nm++ process . So it ’ ll be a Coffee Lake Refresh , effectively , not Cannon Lake which will drop down to an entirely new process ( 10nm ) . Although even if architectural efficiency gains aren ’ t massive , sticking on an extra pair of cores for these top-end processors will obviously help Intel stay competitive when it comes to Ryzen ’ s large core counts . There ’ s also further speculation that while the 9th-gen Core i5 and i3 ranges will keep the same core count as the current models , they will double up on the thread count ( so Core i5 will be 6-cores , 12-threads , and Core i3 will be quad-core , 8-threads ) . Take all this with a liberal sprinkling of salt as ever . When might we see such processors , if they are indeed in the pipeline ? They will apparently be launching at some point in 2018 , although the report doesn ’ t hint at any rough timeline next year .

There ’ s a huge and extremely worrying range of flaws in newer Intel processors which could allow hackers to take full control over the relevant machines – with millions of PCs potentially affected . After a severe exploit was uncovered by Mark Ermolov and Maxim Goryachy , Moscow-based security experts who work for Positive Technologies Research , Intel has admitted that some 10 vulnerabilities exist in the Intel Management Engine , Trusted Execution Engine and Server Platform Services . As mentioned , these flaws can be leveraged to remotely execute commands , take control of machines and pilfer precious data , and they affect all of Intel ’ s Core series of processors from Skylake ( 6th-generation ) onwards , including the firm ’ s latest 8th-gen CPUs . Many Xeon as well as Atom , Pentium and Celeron processors are also hit by these gremlins . Intel lists the full details of chips which are affected here , and also offers a detection tool to check whether your system is subject to these gaping holes ( although note that the utility is designed for businesses , not consumer users ) . As Ars Technica reports , the majority of the vulnerabilities ( six of them ) affect the Intel Management Engine , an independent subsystem on the firm ’ s processors which Intel says is designed for remote admin , but which has long been criticized as a potential backdoor in some quarters . There ’ s been a lot of controversy about the Management Engine of late , because it was found to run a version of Minix – a ‘ mini-Unix ’ OS originally created by Andrew Tanenbaum for educational purposes , but apparently adapted by Intel for its processors . Much of the controversy has bubbled around the fact that the user has no access to this Minix OS , yet it has full access to the host PC , as Network World pointed out earlier this month . And this has long been feared as a big security risk – and now proven so with the discovery of these exploits that can be executed via the Management Engine . This really is quite mind-boggling stuff , topped by the fact that even Tanenbaum , the creator of Minix , didn ’ t realize that Intel was using his OS inside its chips in such a manner ( according to Maxim Goryachy ) . Naturally , there ’ s a big scramble underway to patch the vulnerabilities , and Intel suggests that affected users should check for new firmware from their PC manufacturer . Lenovo is apparently going to have patched firmware rolling out tomorrow , with Dell working on the problem as well , but there ’ s no ETA regarding the latter ’ s patch . Other PC manufacturers are doubtless beavering away , too ( you would hope ) . Meanwhile , in the broader picture going forward , it ’ ll be interesting to see how Intel fights the flames which will doubtless be raging around the issue of exactly what is going on inside the firm ’ s CPUs when it comes to the Management Engine . Modern operating systems and processors should be built to be increasingly secure , of course , but this is clearly a huge step backwards for Intel on the security front .

Cores : 16 Threads : 32 Base clock : 3.4GHz Boost clock : 4.0GHz L3 cache : 32MB TDP : 180W The past few years have seen something of a plateau when it came to consumer processor technology , but this year both AMD and Intel have come out swinging with mighty 16-core behemoths . ( Update : We 've continued to look into why the results for the AMD Threadripper were lower than expected , and worked alongside AMD to identify any problems . It looks like the cause was due to us using a 16GB RAM kit in 2 x 8GB configuration . We 've updated our test benches with 32GB in 4 x 8GB so that neither the Threadripper or the Core i9 CPUs are held back by the RAM and have re-run the tests on both machines . These tests bring back more representative scores . Our initial findings , that these tests result in an overall draw remains , with the Intel CPU performing slightly better than the AMD one , though not by enough of a margin to justify its much higher price tag . For price conscious buyers , the Threadripper 1950X is definitely the one to go for , offering superb performance for a very good price . However , if you have the budget and want nothing but the fastest-performing 16-core CPU , then the Intel Core i9 -7960X is the one to go for . Either way , you 're getting an excellent CPU that will be incredibly future-proof . ) AMD was first out of the gate with its Ryzen Threadripper 1950X , which features 16 cores , 32 threads , a base clock of 3.4GHz and a boost clock of 4.0GHz . Almost everything about the Threadripper is over the top , and AMD knows it , from the physical size of the chip , the way it ’ s installed on a motherboard , the impressive-looking packaging and even its name . It ’ s clearly a processor aimed at enthusiasts , and we ’ re impressed with AMD ’ s overall marketing and presentation of the Threadripper . It ’ s clearly excited and proud of the CPU , and that feeling is infectious . Cores : 16 Threads : 32 Base clock : 2.80GHz Boost clock : 4.20GHz L3 cache : 22MB TDP : 165W Not to be outdone in the high core count stake , Intel then announced its line of Core i9 Skylake X processors , which included the 18-core Intel Core i9-7980XE and the 16-core Core i9-7960X . However , while AMD offers the Threadripper with a lot of bombast , Intel ’ s marketing of the Core i9-7960X is more restrained , so no dramatic-sounding names or fancy-looking packaging here . However , the proof is in the performance and price of these CPUs , so , with both AMD and Intel releasing 16-core CPUs with 32 threads , we thought we ’ d pit them against each other to see which comes out on top . For this test we tried to keep the two systems as similar as possible , with the processor and the motherboard being the biggest differences . For the AMD Threadripper 1950X machine , the components were : Our test bench for the i9 processor is pretty similar to the Threadripper setup , with : On paper the basic specifications hint at a pretty even match , with both the AMD Threadripper 1950X and Intel Core i9-7960X offering 16 cores and 32 threads . However , the AMD Threadripper 1950X wins out with a higher base clock than the Intel Core i9-7960X and more CPU memory cache . Threadripper also supports up to 64 PCI-E lanes , while the Core i9-7960X can handle 44 – still plenty , but not as many as AMD ’ s chip . However , the Core i9-7960X bests the Threadripper when it comes to boost speeds , achieving 4.20GHz to the Threadripper ’ s 4.0GHz , and it also requires less power , with a TDP of 165W compared to the Threadripper ’ s 180W , which means PCs running the Core i9-7960X will run cooler , quieter and cheaper . First we ran CPU benchmarks , starting with the Geekbench 4 suite of tests that puts the processor through its paces , replicating real-world tasks and applications , sometimes very complex ones , and uses those to see how the processors react . A higher score means the CPU is more proficient at completing those tasks . In the single-core benchmark the Threadripper 1950X scored 4,719 , while the Intel Core i9-7960X beat it with 4,919 , which means that despite the higher clock speeds of the Threadripper the 7960X ’ s cores proved more powerful , helped by the higher boost speeds . However , the tables were turned in the multi-core test , with the Threadripper 1950X scoring 30,539 , edging ahead of Intel 's 29,373 . Overall , then , we 're calling this a tie . Next up were the Cinebench benchmarks , which test the CPU and GPU capabilities of the machines , and while the CPU benchmark is the most telling result for this battle between AMD and Intel , the GPU test can show us which CPU can help the graphics card achieve higher frame rates . The CPU test uses the PC ’ s processor to render a photorealistic 3D scene while running a number of algorithms designed to stress all available processor cores , so it ’ s a great way of seeing how good these processors are . First up was the Threadripper machine , which scored 3,015 , but the Core i9 machine scored a touch higher at 3,149 . The GPU test results saw a similar difference , with AMD scoring 89.10 FPS while Intel achieved 138.68 . It ’ s a win for the Intel Core i9-7960X , but only just . The first benchmark we ran was the 3D Mark Fire Strike , which tests how well machines can handle demanding 3D graphics . While there ’ s no doubt that at the moment 16-core processors are overkill for gaming , these benchmarks will give us an idea of the power differences between the two . In this test the AMD Threadripper 1950X machine achieved a mighty score of 22,462 , a big improvement over the 15,444 scored by the AMD Ryzen 7 1700 from our original AMD vs Intel showdown : what ’ s the best gaming CPU ? head-to-head test . However , the Intel Core i9-7960X performed even better , scoring 23,161 , making it the winner in this test . In truth , both these processors ( and the GTX 1080 Ti graphics card ) are powerful enough to easily blow through the standard Fire Strike tests , but what about a more demanding benchmark ? We also tried out the 3D Mark Fire Strike Ultra ( 4K ) benchmark , which as the name suggests tests how well PCs can run ultra graphical settings in 4K resolutions . As is to be expected , the scores for each CPU were lower than the standard test , with the AMD Threadripper 1950X machine scoring 7,157 and the Intel Core i9-7960X scoring 7,233 . The Sky Diver benchmark isn ’ t as intensive as the Fire Strike tests , but it ’ s still a worthwhile tool for seeing just how well a PC can handle DirectX 11 graphics , especially when it comes to physics . More realistic physics can mean more immersive games , so the higher the score here , the better . First up was the AMD Threadripper 1950X machine , which scored a hefty 52,787 in the test . However , the Intel Core i9-7960X machine gained a decent lead lead with 59,785 . Can the Threadripper stage a comeback ? We also wanted to see how well these processors coped with modern games , even though many can ’ t yet take full advantage of 16-core CPUs . Total War : Warhammer 2 is a real-time strategy game which gives your processor a decent workout as it moves vast armies across the battlefield , and that makes it an excellent test for these chips . At low settings , the AMD Threadripper 1950X beat the Intel Core i9-7960X , scoring 230.4 FPS to Intel ’ s 209.8 FPS . At Ultra settings , the Threadripper maintained its lead with a score of 101 FPS compared to Intel ’ s 91.7 FPS . When it comes to CPU-centric games , it looks like the Threadripper ’ s higher base clock helps it achieve slightly better results . Next up we put the two machines through their paces with Middle Earth : Shadow of War . This recent open-world game is certainly a workout for your graphics card , but does the type of CPU you use have an effect as well ? It appears so , with the Intel Core i9-7960X machine achieving 127 FPS on Ultra settings and 178 FPS on Low settings – a decent lead over the AMD Threadripper 1950X , which scored ( a still very good ) 111 FPS on Ultra and 151 FPS on Low . Our final round is perhaps the most important one , as it puts the performance differences between the two chips into context . AMD has traditionally offered processors ( and graphics cards ) that are lower-priced than its competitors ' , and with the AMD Threadripper 1950X we ’ re pleased to see that this has continued . That ’ s not to say the Threadripper is cheap – at $ 999 / £999 / AU $ 1,440 it ’ s certainly a big investment . However , the Intel Core i9-7960X is a fair bit more expensive at $ 1,699 / £1,700 ( around AU $ 2,150 ) . That 's 70 % more , but while our tests show the Intel CPU has a performance advantage over the AMD Threadripper , it ’ s around the 50 % mark – and we should reiterate that the Intel doesn ’ t outperform the Threadripper consistently . So , is an at-best 50 % performance increase worth a 70 % price premium ? We ’ d say not , actually , as the Threadripper is still an awesome-performing CPU , more than capable of handling modern tasks . If you ’ re a gamer , many games won ’ t even take advantage of the Threadripper1950X ’ s power , let alone the Intel Core i9-7960X ’ s , so at the moment you may be paying more for performance you won ’ t benefit from . However , if you do a lot of content creation , or work with a lot of resource-hungry applications where multitasking is essential , the Intel Core i9-7960X 's performance advantage in some areas will be well worth the money . We ’ ve been incredibly impressed with both CPUs , and they show what a bit of healthy competition can do to the processor market . While the Intel Core i9-7960X takes the performance crown , the AMD Threadripper 1950X is no slouch either , and its lower price makes it an incredibly tempting purchase . For those reasons we ’ re calling this battle the two 16-core behemoths a tie .

Nvidia just posted some impressive financial results , and the company is certainly in a buoyant mood , with the CEO taking the time to divulge his thoughts on the recently-revealed AMD and Intel partnership in laptop CPUs , as well as the defection of a key executive from the former to the latter . The Q3 fiscal results were certainly strong , with Nvidia notching up a record revenue of $ 2.64 billion ( around £2 billion , AU $ 3.45 billion ) , an increase of a third compared to a year ago . The firm made big gains with data centers , but surprisingly also experienced a big jump in gaming revenue with a 25 % increase year-on-year – flying in the face of analysts ’ expectations . After boasting of bulging coffers , chief executive Jensen Huang talked on the subject of Raja Koduri leaving AMD to become Intel ’ s senior VP of the Core and Visual Computing Group , with a remit to deliver ‘ high-end discrete graphics ’ . Yes , discrete graphics solutions , not integrated ( on-processor ) affairs . As Tom ’ s Hardware reports , Huang commented : “ Yeah , there 's a lot of news out there ... first of all , Raja leaving AMD is a great loss for AMD , and it 's a recognition by Intel probably that the GPU is just incredibly important now . “ The modern GPU is not a graphics accelerator , we just left the letter ‘ G ’ in there , but these processors are domain-specific parallel accelerators , and they are enormously complex , they are the most complex processors built by anybody on the planet today . ” He goes on to point out that this is exactly why “ every major server around the world has adopted Nvidia GPUs . ” So , there are a couple of things here . First of all , and obviously enough , it ’ s not surprising that the Nvidia CEO wants to paint Koduri ’ s departure as a bad thing for AMD , and AMD ’ s graphics cards , in terms of it being a ‘ great loss ’ . Also , on the Intel side of the equation , Huang focuses on the company ’ s need to drive forward with graphics processors as a critical one . And this likely reflects the fact that the mentioned discrete GPUs Intel talked about in its press release welcoming Koduri into the fold is more about targeting heavyweight arenas such as AI and machine learning , rather than anything to do with gaming . In other words , Intel doing discrete graphics is certainly big news that will make big waves , but not in terms of consumer graphics cards . Note that Intel has tried its hand at discrete graphics cards in the past – or had brief flirtations would perhaps be a better way of putting it – but you get the sense that it ’ s truly a serious drive this time around . Furthermore , Huang took time to comment on AMD and Intel teaming up to make laptop processors with integrated AMD graphics , news which broke earlier this week . His somewhat rambling comment on the matter was : “ And lastly , with respect to the chip that they [ Intel and AMD ] built together , I think it goes without saying , now that the energy efficiency of Pascal GeForce and the Max-Q design technology and all of the software we have created has really set a new design point for the industry , it is now possible to build a state of the art gaming notebook with the most leading edge GeForce processors , and we want to deliver gaming experiences many times that of a console in 4K and have that be in a laptop that is 18mm thin . “ The combination of Pascal and Max-Q has really raised the bar , and that 's really the essence of it . ” In short : Nvidia ’ s rivals need to do something , because the firm ’ s latest advances with Max-Q are pushing the notebook graphics envelope so much . Strong words all round then , but given its current form , Nvidia is unlikely to be short of confidence . Particularly when looking to a future in which graphics processors are key to the likes of supercomputers and cutting-edge fields such as AI and machine learning .

Intel and AMD may be processor rivals , but as we saw at the start of this week , they ’ ve got together to produce a new Intel Core H laptop CPU which will feature Radeon graphics – and benchmarks have just leaked showing the power of Intel ’ s chips which have integrated AMD GPUs . The reported benchmarks spotted in the wild – and remember , nothing is confirmed at this point – show a pair of quad-core ‘ Kaby Lake G ’ processors with integrated AMD graphics , the Core i7-8705G and i7-8809G , both of which have a base clock of 3.1GHz and boost to 4.1GHz . They sport integrated Radeon graphics with 24 compute units and 1,536 stream processors , 4GB of HBM2 memory , with the GPU clocked at 1000MHz for the lesser model , and 1190MHz for the more powerful i7-8809G . As TweakTown observes , the faster GPU will offer around 3.3 TFlops of compute performance , which , if you wanted to draw a comparison with consoles , is about half of the Xbox One X ’ s power ( but much closer to the PS4 Pro which stands at 4.2 TFlops ) . Of course , raw TFlops is far from the best and universal unit of comparison for GPU performance , but we won ’ t go into that now – rather , this is about the story the leaked benchmarks tell . And there are plenty of them , with some highlights including a Geekbench OpenCL score of 76,607 for the more powerful i7-8809G , which unsurprisingly outperformed the lesser i7-8705G in 3DMark 11 achieving an overall score of 4,111 versus 3,879 ( check out the full benchmarks here : Geekbench , 3DMark 11 , GFXBench ) . Hot Hardware also spotted results for the Core i7-8705G in the Ashes of Singularity benchmark at 1080p resolution , with the processor hitting 53 fps at low details , and managing 33 fps with high details . In short , these CPUs show a more than impressive turn of speed , and do indeed look like they ’ re shaping up to be the most powerful integrated graphics solution going for the likes of thin-and-light laptops . And bear in mind that these benchmarks are still for prototype chips , too , so we could see even better numbers when it comes to the finished products . Promising indeed . Via : Liliputing

The battle between Intel and AMD can often seem rather brutal , but it looks like hostilities have paused , at least for now . Both Intel and AMD have announced that the two companies will release an upcoming Intel Core H laptop processor , which combines Intel ’ s CPU technology with AMD ’ s Radeon graphics . The idea is that thin and light laptops running the chip will be able to display high-end games while maintaining a svelte and lightweight design . While on paper the idea of Intel and AMD working together is revolutionary , it ’ s actually not that much of a surprise – we reported on the rumors of a collaboration last month . Also , while Intel and AMD are fierce competitors in the CPU market , on the graphics side of things there is far less animosity , as Intel ’ s integrated HD graphics have never tried to compete with the likes of AMD or Nvidia . According to Intel , combining its Intel Core H-series processors with a custom third-party AMD graphics chip into a single processor package will lead to thinner laptops with a reduced silicon footprint that ’ s over 50 % smaller . This is thanks to Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge ( EMIB ) technology combined with a new power-sharing framework that ’ s been made by Intel to coordinate information between the processor , graphics chip and dedicated graphics memory . As Intel ’ s Christopher Walker explained in a blog post , `` it ’ s a prime example of hardware and software innovations intersecting to create something amazing that fills a unique market gap . '' EMIB is a small , intelligent bridge that allows heterogeneous silicon to quickly pass information in extremely close proximity , allowing for smaller devices and less complex designs , and the Intel-AMD collaboration will be the first consumer product to take advantage of EMIB . The new addition to the Intel Core H-series of mobile processors will also be the first to use HBM2 in mobile PCs , which requires less power – and is smaller – than traditional technology which uses GDDR5 dedicated graphics memory . AMD has also released a statement , saying that “ together , we are offering gamers and content creators the opportunity to have a thinner-and-lighter PC capable of delivering discrete performance-tier graphics experiences in AAA games and content creation applications . ” We ’ ve not had any concrete information on when the new chip will release , though Intel and AMD expect it to launch in the first quarter of 2018 . We ’ ll keep you updated with any further news that we hear about this collaboration between Intel and AMD . Until then , let ’ s all bask in the glow of two sworn enemies putting aside their differences to help bring better experiences to consumers .

At the beginning of 2017 , Intel was the undisputed king when it came to desktop and laptop processors , but now , at the end of the year , while it still retains its leadership of the market , its position isn ’ t quite as unassailable as it used to be . In this article , we ’ ll evaluate how Intel performed in 2017 , and this report card will cover all the highs and lows that this past year has brought for the CPU goliath . We ’ ll also look at how the events of 2017 could determine Intel ’ s success in 2018 and beyond… The beginning of 2017 saw Intel in an incredibly strong position , posting a first quarter revenue of $ 14.8 billion – up from $ 13.7 billion it managed during the first financial quarter of 2016 . Intel ’ s market dominance was also extremely impressive , with Passmark releasing information about the split between Intel and AMD processors used by people running Passmark ’ s range of benchmarks that showed Intel having 79.3 % of the market compared to AMD ’ s 20.6 % . While these results were confined to Windows machines that ran the benchmarks , it was still convincing evidence of Intel ’ s strength . So , revenue was up and market share was still sky high – not many companies entered 2017 in such a strong position . Things could only get better for Intel , right ? Well… Many people would argue that Intel ’ s dominance of the desktop and laptop processor market brought with it a lack of ambition and innovation . AMD , Intel ’ s closest rival , was lagging so far behind in market share , that many people accused Intel of resting on its laurels . Why take risks when you ’ re doing so well ? This meant a good few years where new processors ( from either camp ) saw rather conservative improvements over the ones that came before . So , people with older processors didn ’ t feel like they needed to upgrade . People were getting board . Restless . Then , in March AMD upped the ante by releasing its Ryzen 7 series of processors , which attracted critical acclaim by bringing high core counts ( the flagship AMD Ryzen 7 1800X features 8-cores and 16-threads , as well as a 3.6GHz base speed and top speeds of up to 4GHz ) at very affordable prices . The release of Ryzen 7 , along with the subsequent releases of Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 CPUs , thrust AMD back into the limelight . Customers responded to AMD ’ s new offerings , while Intel , with its high prices and mainstream processors that still maxed out at four cores , was beginning to look out-dated and out of touch . AMD continued to gain positive headlines and reviews when it launched its enthusiast-class Threadripper processors that brought incredibly high core-counts and captured the imaginations of gamers who wanted the very best hardware . AMD had brought the processor war back to Intel , so how would the dominant company respond ? The pressure was on for Intel to respond , and in May at Computex 2017 it did just that by announcing its Intel Core X series of processors , which included the world ’ s first consumer desktop processor with 18 cores and 36 threads – the Intel Core i9-7980XE . The rest of the Core X series were no slouches either , with the Intel Core i9-7960X matching the Threadripper ’ s 16-cores and 32 threads , along with the 14-core i9-7940X , 12-core i9-7920X and 10-core i9-7900X . These high-core CPUs were accompanied by the i7-7820X and i7-7800X , which come with 8-cores and 6-cores respectively , the first time i7 CPUs had gone above quad core ( which was left to the i7 7740X and i5 7640X ) . Intel went as far as to call this new series of CPUs its most `` scalable , accessible and powerful desktop platform ever . '' These new processors certainly showed that Intel was ready to match AMD when it came to high core counts , and they also brought a number of advantages over the previous generation , with a 30 % performance improvement over Intel ’ s seventh generation CPUs , 10 % faster for multi-thread performance , and up to 15 % faster for single-thread performance . So , Intel had no issue with fighting back against a resurgent AMD when it comes to cores and power , but would it also compete with AMD when it came to price , traditionally AMD ’ s strongest area ? The short answer is no . Intel has long had a reputation for releasing CPUs that are a fair amount more expensive than AMD , and in 2017 Intel didn ’ t challenge this perception – it reinforced it . The top-of-the-range Intel Core i9-7980XE , for example , comes in at an eye-watering $ 1,999 ( about £1,480 , AU $ 2,510 ) , while the 16-core Intel Core i9-7960X costs $ 1,699 ( £1,700 , around AU $ 2,150 ) . Meanwhile , AMD ’ s Threadripper 1950X costs $ 999 ( £999 , AU $ 1,440 ) , while going pretty much toe-to-toe with the i9-7960X in terms of performance . In terms of price versus performance , AMD continued to hold the upper hand in 2017 . AMD gets even more competitive in the price department with the Ryzen 3 , 5 and 7 processors , and coupled with the positive critical reception of those CPUs , pressure began to mount on Intel . Throughout 2017 , Intel continued to release processors , including the 8th generation Kaby Lake Refresh for laptops as well as the 8th-generation desktop chips , codenamed Coffee Lake , which came out in October . While these new processors meant upgraders also had to invest in a new motherboard , Intel boasted they would bring a huge 45 % performance boost over its Kaby Lake predecessors . As we observed in our review of the Intel Core i7-8700K , the six-core , 12 thread Coffee Lake-S processor outpaced AMD ’ s Ryzen chips , was a beast at overclocking , and at $ 359 ( about £270 , AU $ 460 ) it was priced to compete with AMD ’ s Ryzen 7 chips . Intel certainly didn ’ t seem to take AMD ’ s challenge lying down , but throughout 2017 ’ s war of the processors there was at least one clear winner : consumers . Lower prices , more cores and a renewed drive for innovation from both sides made 2017 a vintage year for processors . Intel also suffered some rather damaging headlines during 2017 . The biggest controversy came when it was revealed that , since 2010 , millions of Intel chips have been sold with a security flaw in the hidden Management Engine , which could allow malicious users of gaining remote control of the AMT features , potentially providing a backdoor to millions of PCs around the world . After the exploit was uncovered by Mark Ermolov and Maxim Goryachy , Moscow-based security experts who work for Positive Technologies Research , Intel admitted that some 10 vulnerabilities exist in the Intel Management Engine , Trusted Execution Engine and Server Platform Services . This followed concerns that were raised when the Management Engine was found to run a version of Minix – a ‘ mini-Unix ’ OS originally created by Andrew Tanenbaum for educational purposes , but apparently adapted by Intel for its processors . Much of the controversy was over the fact that the user has no access to this Minix OS , yet it has full access to the host PC , and with these security flaws it made uncomfortable reading for both Intel and anyone running on of the affected processors . So , at the end of 2017 , where does this leave Intel ? Due to some excellent product releases , and a new range of Core X processors that takes consumer desktop CPUs to even greater heights , Intel remains the market leader . However , even with a still impressive lead , the landscape has changed and , in 2017 , AMD was able to chip away at Intel ’ s dominance . As we reported in September , German retailer Mindfactory.de , released its CPU sales data ( which were then picked up on Reddit ) for the period between March and August 2017 , which showed that in March AMD CPUs accounted for just 27.6 % of the retailer 's CPU sales , compared to 72.4 % for Intel . However , in April after the Ryzen 7 1800X , 1700X and 1700 had launched , and which saw the introduction of the mid-range Ryzen 5 chips , AMD ’ s share rose to 36.5 % while Intel ’ s dropped to 63.5 % . Most worrying of all for Intel was that , in August 2017 , AMD actually overtook Intel – 56.1 % to 43.9 % . Although this was only sales results from one ( admittedly very large ) retailer , there was similar evidence from various retailers that AMD was clawing back market share . This year also saw Qualcomm , the processor manufacturer that ’ s usually associated with smartphone chips , make more strident moves into the laptop processor market , putting even more pressure on Intel ’ s position . At Computex 2017 , Qualcomm and Microsoft announced that a number of laptops from Asus , HP and Lenovo will run Windows 10 on the Snapdragon 835 platform , and the first of these ‘ always connected ’ PCs will feature seriously impressive 20-hour battery life . With Qualcomm and Microsoft working together , and a reinvigorated AMD , Intel found that , despite its successes this year , 2017 marks the end of its near dominance of the CPU market . So , what can we expect from Intel in 2018 ? After such an eventful 2017 for processors , there is a fear that we could be in for a bit more of a boring year for the company , however there are some rumors swirling about what Intel has in store . First of all , Intel ’ s upcoming Cascade Lake-X family should make an appearance , and rumors suggest it will use Intel ’ s 14mm++ architecture , which brings improved speeds and better temperatures . Intel ’ s delayed 10nm architecture should also make an appearance with the Cannon Lake series finally releasing . Cannon Lake is expected to see considerable gains in performance ( 25 % ) and reductions in power consumption ( 45 % ) , thanks to shrinking the transistor size from 14nm – where Intel ’ s processors are now and have been since its first Core M chips in 2014 . Intel ’ s low-power Atom CPUs should also move from Apollo Lake architecture to Gemini Lake , though it ’ s unlikely there will be a process shrink . Meanwhile we expect AMD to continue putting pressure on Intel with its new range of Ryzen CPUs , while Qualcomm and Microsoft ’ s partnership will continue to bring new devices running Snapdragon 835 , and possibly even 845 , chips . So , 2017 has been a big year for Intel specifically and the processor market in general , and we ’ ll continue to see the repercussions throughout 2018 and beyond .

Subscribe to Maximum PC magazine with an extra 10 % off Coffee Lake is both a significant upgrade to Intel ’ s mainstream CPU line , and one of the longest delays between meaningful improvements . If you ’ re an enthusiast who ’ s already upgraded to a six-core , 12-thread ( 6C12T ) processor , Coffee Lake might not seem like a big deal . We ’ ve had such chips since Gulftown on socket LGA1366 in 2010 , although pricing was higher than many were willing to pay . Read more : Intel Core i9-9900K The Core i7-5820K dropped the entry price for six-core , 12-thread chips to $ 389 in 2014 – basically the same as today ’ s Core i7-8700K . The problem is that Intel ’ s mainstream platform , LGA115x , has stuck at four-core , eight-thread since 2009 ’ s first-gen Core i7s . That ’ s eight years of stagnation , largely because AMD never had a superior product . Ryzen changed that , and while it doesn ’ t win every benchmark , the availability of competitive 8C16T chips at prices that undercut Intel ’ s 4C8T CPUs looks bad , and the 6C12T Ryzen 5 parts cost less than most of Intel ’ s 4C4T Core i5 parts . If you ’ re running workloads that can benefit from more cores/threads , Ryzen has been an easy recommendation since launch . After coasting on the mainstream platform for eight years , Intel has been able to rapidly release more cores and higher performance . Coffee Lake has better per-core performance than Ryzen , and clock speeds that are up to 30 % higher . What ’ s more , unlike the mesh topology used in Skylake-X , Coffee Lake sticks with Intel ’ s ring bus . The result is some killer performance , with the Core i7-8700K claiming top marks among 6C12T products . Not to be outdone , the Core i5-8400 is a 6C6T part that includes reasonable ( 3.8-4.0GHz ) clocks , and in a large suite of games it matches the performance of a stock Core i7-7700K , at about half the price and two-thirds the power use . The problem is that Coffee Lake uses the same LGA1151 socket as Skylake and Kaby Lake , except the pin-out has changed , and a new chipset and mobo is required . That ’ s a low blow , even from Intel , considering Z270 boards aren ’ t even a year old . As exciting as 2017 has been , there are indications that 2018 won ’ t slow down . Rumblings from AMD hint at architectural tweaks enabling better per-core performance and higher clock speeds , and Ryzen 2 ( or whatever it ’ s called ) will run in existing AM4 motherboards . Not to be outdone , Intel could release an 8C16T Coffee Lake chip – alhough that would require a new die . And Intel ’ s 10nm Cannon Lake chips should finally arrive by the end of 2018 , possibly sooner . Here ’ s to competition , and more reasons to think about building another PC .

Intel has revealed new Pentium Silver processors and budget-friendly Intel Celeron chips . As the first CPUs based on the firm ’ s ‘ Gemini Lake ’ architecture ( following up on existing ‘ Apollo Lake ’ offerings ) these are new cheap and power-efficient processors for desktop PCs and laptops . On the desktop side , the chip maker has introduced the Intel Pentium Silver J5005 and Intel Celeron J4105 and J4005 . The Pentium Silver J5005 is a quad-core ( four-thread ) CPU with a clock speed of up to 2.8GHz , with Intel UHD Graphics 605 ( integrated graphics ) with a graphics clock speed of 800MHz . Incidentally , Pentium Silver means that the chip is based on the Atom architecture , a lower-cost ( and lower-power ) alternative to the main Core series of Intel processors . A few months ago Intel introduced Pentium Gold , which was based on the company 's last generation Kaby Lake offerings . In short , Silver processors aren ’ t as good as Gold in the performance stakes , but that 's reflecting in the savings and lower prices . The Intel Celeron J4105 is also a quad-core ( four-thread ) processor with a clock speed of up to 2.5GHz , and Intel UHD Graphics 600 ( with a graphics clock speed of 750MHz ) . The Celeron J4005 brings up the rear as a dual-core ( two-thread ) CPU with a clock speed of up to 2.7GHz and Intel UHD Graphics 600 ( clocked at 700MHz ) . Moving onto the mobile processors aimed at laptops , the Pentium Silver N5000 is a quad-core ( four-thread ) CPU with a clock speed of up to 2.7GHz , again with Intel UHD Graphics 605 ( clocked at 750MHz ) . And the Intel Celeron N4100 and N4000 mirror their desktop counterparts , with just slightly slower clock speeds ( up to 2.4GHz and 2.6GHz respectively ) and with marginally slower integrated graphics ( clocked at 700MHz and 650MHz respectively ) . Furthermore , the chips offer Gigabit Wi-Fi and will be good for a claimed 10 hours of HD video playback on a notebook with a 35WHr battery . Intel further noted that Pentium Silver delivers 58 % faster productivity performance ( based on SYSmark benchmarking ) compared to a PC with a four-year-old Pentium processor . Intel says that we can expect to see notebooks packing these new chips go on sale in the first quarter of next year .

News about the Meltdown and Spectre processor seems to be going from bad to worse , and over the weekend Microsoft had to release an emergency patch to disable patches for the Spectre bug . The Windows Update ( KB4078130 ) in question is something of a rarity , as not only did Microsoft rush it out over the weekend ( rather than waiting until Tuesday , the usual day Microsoft releases updates ) , but it directly disables a security patch released by Intel . This means that the issues the Intel patch caused were deemed more serious than the security vulnerabilities it was designed to fix – at least in the short term . For the latest on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown , read our comprehensive guide . The issues Intel ’ s patch caused were revealed last week when Intel admitted that its was causing some machines to reboot unexpectedly . Intel even warned users against downloading its own patch , with Intel EVP Neil Shenoy saying that “ we recommend that OEMs , cloud service providers , system manufacturers , software vendors , and end users stop deployment of current versions on specific platforms , as they may introduce higher than expected reboots and other unpredictable system behavior . ” Microsoft has clearly taken Intel ’ s advice , by stating that it had released the emergency patch to disable Intel ’ s Spectre patch because “ our own experience is that system instability can in some circumstances cause data loss or corruption . On January 22 , Intel recommended that customers stop deploying the current microcode version on impacted processors while they perform additional testing on the updated solution . ” According to Microsoft , this new patch “ specifically disables only the mitigation against CVE-2017-5715 ” , which is the other , less catchy name for Spectre Variant 2 . If you ’ re not keen on removing the protection against Spectre , and feel like the possibility of system crashes is a price worth paying , then Microsoft has made it possible for users to manually disable and enable the mitigation against Spectre by changing registry settings . Needless to say , this will be for advanced users only , but you can follow Microsoft ’ s instructions if you 're comfortable editing the registry . Most users , however , should wait for a new patch from Intel that will mitigate against Spectre , without causing system instabilities . With Intel vowing to stop Meltdown and Spectre by the end of January , we hopefully won ’ t have too long to wait .

Intel has been busy fire-fighting the Meltdown and Spectre bugs throughout January , and the firm ’ s latest step in its uphill PR battle is to clarify that new chips which are bulletproof to the vulnerabilities will start to turn up later in 2018 . This information was imparted by the CEO of Intel , Brian Krzanich himself , in an earnings call to investors following the revelation of the company ’ s latest financial results . As Hexus reports , Krzanich said that Intel was still ‘ working around the clock ’ on patches to mitigate Meltdown and Spectre , but that software fixes obviously aren ’ t enough in terms of looking to the future , and that changes in the architecture of upcoming CPUs are underway to defend against the bugs on a fundamental level . Krzanich said : “ We ’ re working to incorporate silicon-based changes to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware . And those products will begin appearing later this year . ” This is nothing less than you would hope , really , but it ’ s still positive news to hear that next-gen chips will ( hopefully ) soon have protection baked in . For the latest on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown , read our comprehensive guide . Intel is currently facing a barrage of criticism from all quarters – including class-action lawsuits , and accusations of possible mishandling of the embargo regarding disclosure of the bugs . And it really hasn ’ t helped matters that the firm ’ s patches have been found to cause instability with some processors . Indeed , Intel even recommended against installing its own patches earlier this week . Despite all this , Intel ’ s fiscal results for Q4 2017 showed record revenue – up 8 % year-on-year – with revenue for the full year growing 9 % and reaching $ 62.8 billion ( around £44 billion , AU $ 78 billion ) , another record .

More criticism has been levelled at Intel and its partners in patching up the huge Meltdown and Spectre flaws – including Apple and Microsoft – by US lawmakers , who aren ’ t entirely happy about the way the whole episode has played out . And more specifically , the manner in which disclosure was delayed and generally handled . As the Register reports , four Republicans in the House of Representatives – who chair various subcommittees including Energy and Commerce – sent the same lengthy letter to the CEOs of Intel , as well as Amazon , AMD , Apple , ARM , Google and Microsoft , essentially grilling them on exactly how the embargo on these bugs was handled . The missive explains what we already know : that the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities were discovered last June , but the aforementioned tech companies kept it all to themselves while they worked on fixes , with a planned disclosure date of January 9 in place . Although as it turned out , news of the security bugs leaked a week early , just as the New Year kicked off . Now , obviously enough , the bugs were kept secret to prevent nefarious types from attempting to exploit them while the complex patches were worked on – but the letter points out that the issue with keeping this to just these seven leading tech firms left the rest of the industry rather in the lurch . Particularly given the fact that the disclosure embargo was broken a week early . What this meant is that the rest of the tech industry was left scrambling to get fixes established , having been caught completely off-guard . As the letter puts it : “ Some observers have raised questions about the effect of the embargo on the ability of companies not included in the original June 2017 disclosure to protect their own products and users , compared to those companies that were included . ” The letter then quotes one such ( unnamed ) company , which explained that “ unfortunately , the strict embargo placed by Intel has significantly limited our ability to establish a comprehensive understanding of the potential impact ” . It further observes that the patches which have been rushed out have subsequently caused problems with the likes of antivirus software conflicts , and ‘ freezing ’ PCs ( perhaps a reference to the stability issues encountered with some Intel processors , as we ’ ve seen of late ) . For the latest on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown , read our comprehensive guide . The lawmakers acknowledge the need for secrecy while patching big flaws like these , but the thrust of the letter seems to be that Intel ’ s approach didn ’ t work all that effectively in this case , and perhaps a wider net should have been cast in terms of the companies informed about the bugs ( or that others in the industry should have got at least a little more warning ) . The subcommittee representatives clearly aren ’ t happy with the way the whole incident has panned out , and conclude that : “ We believe that this situation has shown the need for additional scrutiny regarding multi-party coordinated vulnerability disclosures . ” An Intel spokesperson has responded to say : “ The security of our customers and their data is critical to us . We appreciate the questions from the Energy and Commerce Committee and welcome the opportunity to continue our dialogue with Congress on these important issues . “ In addition to our recent meetings with legislative staff members , we have been discussing with the Committee an in-person briefing , and we look forward to that meeting . ” Meanwhile , Intel continues to fire-fight problems with its own patches for Meltdown and Spectre , and earlier this week , the company warned folks not to install the fixes for now due to the aforementioned stability problems ( which include issues with multiple reboots and generally ‘ unpredictable ’ system behavior ) .

If you own a PC or Mac using an Intel processor and have been patiently waiting for Spectre and Meltdown patches appear on Windows Update or Mac App Store updates , you should n't download it . That ’ s the latest directive from Intel , who cited spontaneous reboot and system instability problems – first reported January 11 – following its latest firmware patch aimed to defend against the Spectre and Meltdown exploit vulnerabilities . The company issued a blog post today warning both its partners and end users . “ We recommend that OEMs , cloud service providers , system manufacturers , software vendors , and end users stop deployment of current versions on specific platforms , ” Intel EVP Neil Shenoy writes , “ as they may introduce higher than expected reboots and other unpredictable system behavior . ” Intel is just now getting to the bottom of the problem , having identified the root cause of these issues in Broadwell and Haswell-generation chips . The firm claims to have already issued early versions of fixes for these issues to its partners , but not yet a final release . For the latest on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown , read our comprehensive guide linked above . However , Intel has yet to directly address similar issues affecting both older and more recent processors than the Broadwell and Haswell families , namely Ivy Bridge , Skylake , Kaby Lake , and Coffee Lake generations . However , it has named processors from those families as suffering from the problem in official documentation . In short , while computing device vendors and other Intel partners work with Intel to fix these issues at the top level and hopefully avoid these faulty patches , the firm also asking end users to stay away from the latest processor updates . However , the firm stresses users should keep their devices up-to-date and secure with with all other software releases . ( Do n't worry , AMD is suffering a similar fate , with Microsoft recently having to halt a patch from the firm for similar reasons . ) If your machine automatically updates through Windows 10 Update or the Mac App Store and you ’ re experiencing these problems , it ’ s unknown when a fix will be available for you .

You may recall that last week , Intel warned that its fixes for Meltdown and Spectre had caused elements of instability with some of its older processors , but now the firm has said that the stability gremlins also pertain to newer chips . Much newer chips , in fact . In a news update which clarified that firmware updates have now been issued for 90 % of Intel ’ s processors introduced in the past five years , as planned , Intel restated that some customers have reported ‘ more frequent reboots ’ on Haswell and Broadwell ( 4th and 5th-gen CPUs ) powered PCs after the patch had been applied . The chip giant then added that ‘ similar behavior ’ occurs on some machines which have still-older Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge ( 2nd and 3rd-gen ) processors , but more worryingly , newer Skylake and Kaby Lake CPUs ( 6th and 7th-gen ) . Intel said that it had replicated these issues in internal testing , and that it ’ s making progress in terms of identifying the precise cause . The firm also noted that it will be providing a fresh beta microcode patch to manufacturers and software developers next week for testing . So , in short , these patch problems affect all of Intel ’ s processors , except the original Core 1st-gen CPUs , and the very latest 8th-gen models . Hopefully a streamlined fix without these issues will emerge pretty soon after vendor testing is done next week , although Intel doesn ’ t recommend that folks wait before patching , given the seriousness of these bugs . As we reported earlier this week , there ’ s every chance that the assorted hackers and malware peddlers out there could be close to weaponizing some kind of exploit to leverage against these vulnerabilities . And if that happens , say , tomorrow , you won ’ t want to be unpatched for the sake of avoiding some rebooting issues . Still , it ’ s certainly surprising that Intel understated the reach of these stability issues earlier this week , and that processors as recent as Kaby Lake models are hit . Of course , if you ’ re fretting about these security flaws , don ’ t forget that we have a full guide on how to protect against Meltdown and Spectre . Via PC World

A new leak appears to show Intel ’ s plans for its upcoming solid state drives ( SSDs ) , and it looks like there 's going to be some very impressive technology included that will bring faster read and write speeds , while upping storage space as well . The details , which leaked online and were reported on by Tom ’ s Hardware , allegedly show Intel ’ s upcoming SSD product line with 64-layer 3D memory , along with their specifications . If the leak turns out to be true , it looks like we ’ ll be seeing some very fast , very large SSDs in the near future . The top-of-the-range Intel 760p SSD is set to come in the M.2 PCIe form factor , built with 64-layer TLC ( triple-level cell ) 3D NAND . NAND memory stores data in physical memory cells , and the more data is stored per cell , the denser the memory is . The 760p will come in five capacities : 128GB , 256GB , 512GB , 1TB and 2TB , and will offer sequential read speeds of an astonishing 3,200 MB/s and write speeds of 1,600 MB/s . Basically , this is an incredibly fast SSD . Next up is the 700p , which is a BGA-based SSD . BGA SSDs are quite a bit smaller than ( already tiny ) M.2 drives , and are often used in small tablet devices and 2-in-1 laptops . This comes in 128GB , 256GB and 512GB capacities , and offers speeds of up to 1,800 MB/s read and 1,200 MB/s write . The 660p SSD is next , and this is particularly noteworthy as it comes with QLC ( quad-level-cell ) technology , which despite being even denser , will apparently be capable of speeds of 1,800 MB/s and 1,100 MB/s sequential read and write , respectively . This is faster than most people anticipated , which bodes well for QLC SSDs , and the 660p comes in 512GB , 1TB and 2TB capacities . QLC technology could also see prices for SSDs drop , with one source telling Tom ’ s Hardware that 512GB QLC SSDs could be sold for around $ 100 ( about £80 , AU $ 125 ) , which would be an incredible price for a such a large and fast SSD . Hopefully we ’ ll see more QLC SSDs in the future , and if these Intel drives do exist , we look forward to testing them out soon .

Intel has cautioned that the fixes for the Meltdown and Spectre bugs may cause instability with some older processors , while the firm ’ s CEO also issued a statement promising greater transparency regarding these sort of major vulnerabilities going forward . The bad news on the fix front applies to Broadwell and Haswell CPUs in terms of both consumer and data center use , with rebooting issues apparently plaguing some users . In a security update ( spotted by the Register ) Intel stated : “ We have received reports from a few customers of higher system reboots after applying firmware updates . Specifically , these systems are running Intel Broadwell and Haswell CPUs for both client and data center . We are working quickly with these customers to understand , diagnose and address this reboot issue . ” So , presumably pre-Haswell processors aren ’ t hit . The solution may require a revised firmware update , and Intel notes it ’ s busy chewing the problem over with customers and working on a solution right now . Meanwhile , Intel ’ s chief executive Brian Krzanich issued a statement of his own ( highlighted by the Verge ) making several pledges , including a promise of ‘ transparent and timely communications ’ from the company . Krzanich restated Intel ’ s previously noted goal of patching 90 % of Intel processors introduced in the last five years against the bugs by the end of this week , with updates coming for the rest of the firm ’ s CPUs before the end of the month . He further added that Intel will “ commit to publicly identify significant security vulnerabilities following rules of responsible disclosure ” going forward . And in terms of transparency with the fixes for these ( and other ) bugs , Krzanich said : “ As we roll out software and firmware patches , we are learning a great deal . We know that impact on performance varies widely , based on the specific workload , platform configuration and mitigation technique . We commit to provide frequent progress reports of patch progress , performance data and other information . ” To that end , Intel has also released some fresh performance benchmarks showing the impact of the Meltdown and Spectre patches across a range of different applications . As the firm had previously stated , these figures show that its latest ( 8th-gen ) processors – running on a PC with an SSD – show a maximum 6 % performance hit . That ’ s across PCMark 10 , SYSmark 2014 SE and 3DMark benchmarks . It ’ s interesting to see the other figures for a mobile Kaby Lake CPU show a bigger dip of 14 % in one benchmark , and Skylake desktop processors show a drop of 21 % in that same benchmark – namely SYSmark 2014 ’ s responsiveness test . While that ’ s somewhat worrying , these big drops are only witnessed in this one benchmark , so it looks like something of an anomaly . The other six benchmarks cited for SYSmark and PCMark show drops of up to 7 % with Kaby Lake CPUs , and up to 10 % in Skylake ( although most of the Skylake results still hover around 6 % to 7 % drops ) . The good news for gamers is that the DX11 benchmarks show no real difference post-patch , with results either unchanged , or slight drops of a percentage point or two which doubtless won ’ t be noticeable . So , what Intel initially said seems broadly true , although there are incidents of bigger slowdowns . What is perhaps more concerning is that these are benchmarks for Skylake or newer processors , and we ’ ve yet to see any figures from Intel regarding the impact on older CPUs . According to Microsoft ’ s own benchmarking , those using Haswell ( 4th-gen ) processors or older will experience more significant slowdowns , and “ some users ” will potentially notice a decrease in system performance ( as opposed to Intel ’ s assertion that any sluggishness wouldn ’ t realistically be noticeable ) . And if you ’ re running an older operating system – previous to Windows 10 – with one of these older chips , the situation gets worse , and “ most users ” will notice a drop in their PC ’ s performance . If Intel is shooting for transparency , the firm needs to produce figures showing the effects on older processors , and the company has indeed pledged to do so shortly , stating : “ Within the next week , we intend to offer a representative set of data for mobile and desktop platforms that were launched within the past five years . ” That means we should see benchmarks going back to and including Haswell processors , as that generation of Core CPUs was launched in 2013 , or five years ago . And it ’ ll definitely be interesting to get those results , to see how they shape up in the light of Microsoft ’ s findings . Meantime , on the other side of the CPU fence , AMD has published an update on its processor ’ s security regarding Spectre ( as Meltdown doesn ’ t affect AMD chips , only Intel ones ) . AMD said that concerning Google Project Zero ( GPZ ) variant 1 of Spectre ( ‘ bounds check bypass ’ ) , this can be contained by an OS patch , and Microsoft is distributing patches for most AMD PCs right now . Not all machines , however , due to the major issue of the Windows patch causing boot failure for some PCs with older AMD processors . This led to Microsoft halting the distribution of the patch , although the problem should be corrected ‘ shortly ’ , and Microsoft will begin pushing out the update again for older AMD PCs by next week . Concerning GPZ variant 2 of Spectre ( ‘ branch target injection ’ ) , AMD said it was ‘ difficult to exploit ’ with its processors , but that nonetheless , it was continuing to work closely with the industry at large in negating this threat , and that : “ We have defined additional steps through a combination of processor microcode updates and OS patches that we will make available to AMD customers and partners to further mitigate the threat . ” The company said it would make optional microcode updates available for Ryzen and Epyc CPUs starting this week , with updates for older processors due to arrive in the ‘ coming weeks ’ . Finally , if you ’ re worried about these security flaws , don ’ t forget that we have a full guide on how to protect against Meltdown and Spectre .

Dell has refreshed its Inspiron Gaming Desktop at CES 2018 , adding Intel ’ s latest processors into the mix ( up to six-core models ) and offering optional Optane acceleration . To be precise , the new PC offers a choice of Intel ’ s 8th-gen processors : the Core i3-8100 ( quad-core , 3.6GHz ) , Core i5-8400 ( six-core , up to 4GHz Turbo ) or the Core i7-8700 ( six-core , up to 4.6GHz Turbo ) . The Dell Inspiron Gaming Desktop ( model 5680 ) can be specified with either 8GB or 16GB of system RAM ( although you can later expand up to 64GB if needed ) , and a choice of Nvidia graphics cards : GeForce GTX 1070 , GTX 1060 or GTX 1050 . As for storage , you can plump for a simple 1TB hard disk , or a dual-drive setup with up to a 256GB M.2 SSD along with up to a 2TB hard drive . You can also add an Intel Optane memory module of up to 32GB in size to turbocharge a hard drive . All this is powered by a 460W PSU , and the case has plenty of air vents , and an internal design which aims to achieve optimal airflow to help keep everything cool . And to help keep everything looking cool , there ’ s an optional side window panel and ‘ polar blue ’ lighting . On the sonic front , there ’ s built-in 7.1 Channel HD audio , and pre-installed software includes SmartByte , a ‘ network optimizer ’ that prioritizes video packets ahead of other traffic to ensure that streaming video runs nice and smoothly . The Inspiron Gaming Desktop 5680 goes on sale in the US today with a starting price of $ 749 ( around £550 , AU $ 950 ) . In other Dell gaming news from CES , the company revealed an all-new Alienware Command Center . If you ’ re not familiar with this , the software is designed to be a one-stop-shop for all your gaming-related tweaking . The overhauled center benefits from a completely redesigned user interface , and a new game library that automatically imports all your gaming titles . You can specify profiles for each game to use different power management or thermal settings , overclocking , and system lighting effects . Speaking of the latter , the new Command Center supports up to 16.8 million colors for custom lighting effects . And as for overclocking , there ’ s a tool on hand which makes this sometimes tricky endeavor a safe and simple experience . All of these sound like worthwhile improvements , particularly when it comes to making overclocking more accessible to the less tech-savvy . The new Alienware Command Center should debut at some point in the first quarter ( so at the latest it will arrive in March , but hopefully before that ) .
Intel wasted no time during its CES 2018 keynote in addressing the Meltdown and Spectre bugs potentially threatening all its processors . The company 's CEO Brian Krzanich used the opening moments of the keynote to promise that the company would patch 90 % of affected processors made in the past five years by the end of this week . From there , the following 10 % of vulnerable processors will see fixes by the end of the month . Krzanich also stated that Intel has found no evidence to suggest that either exploit has yet been used to uncover user data . Intel is yet to give details about how and when it will distribute these fixes , but for now check out our guide on how to protect yourself against the Meltdown and Spectre CPU security flaws .

Another Asus gaming machine has been revealed under the bright lights of CES in Las Vegas , and in this case it ’ s a beefy desktop PC . The ROG Strix GL12 is a gaming PC built around Intel ’ s latest 8th-gen processors , with the rig being capable of taking a Core-i7 8700/8700K ( six-core with Turbo up to 4.8GHz ) , or a Core i5-8400 CPU . That ’ s backed up with one of Nvidia ’ s GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards , and 8GB of DDR4 system RAM ( running at 2666MHz ) . Storage includes options on up to a 512GB PCIe SSD , and up to a 2TB hard disk . Asus further notes that this rig has an easy-swap SSD tray to make upgrading storage a dead simple affair . The company describes the design as ‘ unconventional ’ and ‘ aggressive ’ , with angular aesthetics , and a somewhat bulging look at the front – it ’ s likely to be a bit of a love-or-hate affair . The ROG Strix GL12 also has a transparent side panel along with Aura Sync customizable lighting , which allows for the lights on the front of the machine to be lit with over 16 million possible colors ( complete with a number of preset effects ) . Aura Sync , as the name suggests , allows you to synchronize lighting effects with other peripherals that support the tech ( keyboards , mice , headsets and more – see later in this story ) . The Asus ROG Strix GL12 will go on sale in April , although pricing has yet to be confirmed . The company further revealed a batch of fresh accessories , headed up by a new gaming keyboard . The ROG Strix Flare is an RGB backlit mechanical gaming keyboard that uses Cherry MX RGB switches . It also has a bank of media keys – including a dedicated volume wheel – and a detachable wrist rest . Furthermore , it uses Aura Sync lighting , the same as the above gaming desktop , and offers a USB pass-through port , allowing gamers to connect a mouse ( or other peripheral ) via the keyboard . Asus also has further lighting innovations with a couple more ROG accessories . The ROG Aura Terminal is a compact black box that can be hooked up to LED strips mounted behind a monitor . It ’ s capable of detecting the colors at the edge of the monitor screen , and synchronizing the LED strips with those colors to create a ‘ halo ’ of lighting around the monitor for extra immersion . There ’ s also the ROG Spotlight that projects the ROG logo onto a wall with lighting that can be synced up with other Aura Sync-toting devices . It looks like a small webcam and has a magnetic base for easy attachment to any metal surface . Finally , Asus has produced a ‘ Bezel-free Kit ’ , a neat bit of technology which can be used to eliminate the visible bezels in multi-monitor setups . Essentially , the kit consists of vertical lenses and mounts which are used to attach the monitors together ( at an angle of 130-degrees ) , using clever light refraction techniques to make the monitor edges seem to disappear . It ’ s easier to see the results rather than explain them – check the above image . All of these accessories are set to become available in the first half of 2018 , although no prices have yet been mentioned .
Intel has shown off its new collection of 8th-generation Core processors , and these CPUs are particularly notable because they feature discrete graphics technology by AMD , Intel ’ s longstanding rival . While this rare collaboration between Intel and AMD piqued our interest when it was revealed last year , the new information provided by Intel shows just how exciting these new processors could be . The new Core processors are Intel ’ s first CPU with discrete graphics included in a single package , allowing for incredibly thin and light laptops and PCs that are able to provide impressive gaming performance and 4K media streaming . These chips also contain a number of other firsts . According to Intel , they will be the first example of power sharing across CPU and GPU , the first consumer mobile chips to use HBM2 ( the second-generation high bandwidth memory , a faster type of graphics memory ) , and the first consumer solution to use Intel EMIB . EMIB stands for Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge , which combines several separate components onto a single package ( such as CPU and GPU ) , and allows for high-speed communication between the two . According to Intel , it also reduces the silicon footprint by over 50 % , allowing it to be used in much thinner and lighter devices . The CPU and GPU are now just 1.7mm thin , and when compared to previous chips , which had discrete chips for CPU , GPU and memory , the new EMIB takes up far less room on the motherboard . This also means the chips are more power efficient as well , resulting in less heat generated and longer battery life , and includes new Intel Dynamic Tuning features . In the breakdown of the chip ( seen above ) you can see where each component resides , with the 4GB of HBM2 sitting next to the custom Radeon RX Vega M graphics chip , and the 8th generation Intel Core processor sitting slightly further away , connected to the GPU via eight lanes of PCIe 3.0 . The new processors are all quad-core chips with eight threads , support for two channels of DDR4-2400 memory and Intel HD 630 graphics ( for less intensive graphical tasks ) . The Intel Core i7-8809G is the top-of-the-range edition , and features a base clock of 3.1GHz which can boost to 4.2GHz . It features Radeon RX Vega M GH discrete graphics with 24 compute units , 1,536 stream processors , 4GB HBM2 , 1.6Gbps memory interface data rate , 204.8 GB/s memory bandwidth , a base GPU clock of 1,063 MHz and a boost clock of 1,190 MHz . Next is the Intel Core i7-8709G , which features very similar specs to the 8809G , but has a slightly lower maximum processor frequency ( 4.1GHz ) , and does not allow for discrete GPU and HBM overclocking . The Intel Core i7-8706G follows , with the same base and maximum processor frequencies as the 8709G , but this time includes the Radeon RX Vega M GL for discrete graphics . This has 20 compute units , 1,280 stream processors , 1.4Gbps memory interface data rate , 179.2GB/s memory bandwidth , a base clock of 931 MHz and a boost clock of 1,011 MHz . The Intel Core i7-870G is next , and has broadly the same specs as the 8706G , but doesn ’ t include Intel TSX support or Intel vPro technology , which the 8706G does . Finally , the Intel Core i5-8305G features a maximum frequency of 3.8GHz , with a base clock frequency of 2.8GHz and , unlike the other chips , doesn ’ t support overclocking in any form . Intel also shared more information on the GPUs , both the discrete Radeon RX Vega M , and the integrated Intel HD 630 , as each of the new 8th generation processors contains two graphics subsystems . The discrete Radeon display engine supports up to six displays and 4K resolution , and outputs from a Display Port 1.4 with HDR support , and a HDMI 2.0b with HDR10 support . It has up to 24 compute units , supports Vulkan and DirectX 12 graphics APIs and can encode 4K footage at 60fps ( frames per second ) , along with HEVC and H264 encode and decode . Meanwhile , the integrated Intel Gfx display engine supports three displays , up to 4K resolution , VP9 and HEVC 10b encode and decode , and H264 . This lower-powered graphics subsystem is therefore useful for watching media and doing non-demanding graphical tasks , so battery life isn ’ t depleted as quickly , while gaming and graphic intensive tasks are left to the Radeon subsystem . Intel also provided benchmark results to show the performance benefits of the new chips . While we ’ d rather test the chips ourselves using our own benchmarks , the ones provided by Intel at least give us some idea of what benefits the new chips will bring . First , it showed how an 8th generation Intel Core processor with Radeon RX Vega M GL graphics compared to a three-year-old system with a Core i7-4720HQ CPU and Nvidia GTX 950M GPU . In the 3DMark 11 graphics benchmarks , it performed 2.2 times better , and transcoded video in handbrake 6.7 times faster . The chip was also compared to a system with a Core i7-8550U processor and Nvidia GTX 1050 ( 4GB ) GPU , and it performed 1.3 times better in the 3DMark 11 graphics benchmark , with an average frames per second of 46fps in Hitman ( compared to 33fps ) , and 36fps for Deus Ex : Mankind Divided ( compared to the GTX 1050 system ’ s 27fps ) . An 8th generation Core processor with the Radeon RX Vega GH graphics was also compared to a three-year-old system with a Core i7-4720HQ CPU and Nvidia GTX 960M GPU , with it scoring 2.7 times higher in the 3DMark 11 graphics benchmarks , along with 2.7 times better fps in Hitman , and twice the fps in Total War : Warhammer . So , it looks like the new 8th generation Core processors from Intel could bring better gaming performance to thinner and lighter gaming laptops . This is very exciting stuff , and we ’ re looking forward to testing out upcoming devices that use the processors soon .
Intel has just announced its new line of 8th generation Core processors with AMD Radeon RX Vega M discrete graphics at CES 2018 , and to show off how powerful small PCs running these chips will be , it ’ s also released the Intel NUC 8 Enthusiast . Intel ’ s NUC ( Next Unit of Computing ) mini PCs have always been handy little showcases for Intel ’ s technology , and the new version is set to really impress us . Running on an Intel Core i7-8809G , which comes with an AMD Radeon RX Vega M graphics card , rather than just relying on integrated graphics , the Intel NUC 8 Enthusiast is set to be able to handle most modern games , as well as support 4K resolutions . There will be two versions available : the NUC8i7HVK , which comes with Radeon RX Vega M GH graphics , which can be overclocked , and the NUC8i7HNK , which comes with the slightly less powerful Radeon RX Vega M GL GPU , and can ’ t be overclocked . Intel is advertising the NUC8i7HVK as being able to play VR games as well , so if you ’ re looking for a small PC for your living room that can handle VR , that could be a great choice . Both NUC devices , as with previous models , are barebones units , which means you need to install memory and storage yourself , but this does give you flexibility when configuring the new NUCs . They will both support up to 32GB of dual channel DDR4 RAM , and have two M.2 slots for storage . They also come with two rear Thunderbolt 3 ports , USB 3.1 ports and plenty of USB 3.0 connections as well . They also come with front and rear HDMI 2.0a ports that support 4K video at 60Hz and HDR , along with DisplayPort 1.3 , and all video out ports will support HDCP 2.2 . Audio is handled via HDMI and DisplayPort ( with 7.1 surround sound ) , TOSLINK optical connection , or via 3.5mm jacks ( there ’ s two , one at the front for headphones , and one at the back ) . All of this is packed into a 1.2 liter box made from metal and plastic with dimensions of 221 x 142 x 39mm , and it comes with a VESA mount for hiding it behind your TV or monitor . We don ’ t know what kind of prices Intel will be asking for , but we ’ ll let you know as soon as we ’ ve heard .

As the Meltdown and Spectre controversy rumbles on , Intel is now taking more flak in the form of three class-action lawsuits filed in California , Indiana and Oregon , over in the US . And what ’ s more , further suits are expected to be in the pipeline as the Guardian reports . The lawsuits have been filed alleging design flaws in Intel CPUs , and furthermore the company ’ s delay in publicly disclosing these vulnerabilities , with the plaintiffs also unhappy about the potential slowdown of PCs that the fixes for the issues could possibly cause . On the latter point , Intel argued earlier this week that contrary to all the initial talk of up to 30 % slowdowns , any performance impact will be very much workload-related , with the effect on the average PC user not likely to be significant ( and even then , it will be “ mitigated over time ” according to Intel ) . The Californian lawsuit claims for “ breach of warranty and violations of consumer protection statutes alleging that Intel ’ s selling of computer chips with this fatal security flaw misled consumers about the performance and reliability of the computers operating with this hardware ” . Gerard Stranch , managing partner of BS & J , one of the firms which is filing the Californian suit , commented : “ We look forward to holding Intel responsible for exposing millions of Americans to unnecessary data security risks , and will lead the charge to ensure that Intel corrects these flaws as quickly as possible . ” As you may have seen , Intel came out yesterday with a statement assuring the general computing public that its next batch of security updates for its processors would make them ‘ immune ’ to these exploits . That in itself is an arguable point , because others , such as prominent members of Google ’ s Project Zero , have noted that one of the vulnerabilities ( Spectre ) can ’ t actually be patched up via a security fix as it ’ s a fundamental chip design problem – one that might not be fully solvable until next-gen chips hit the market . It ’ s interesting that Intel has been singled out to be put in the legal firing line when Spectre doesn ’ t only affect Intel processors ( as is the case with Meltdown ) . Indeed , Spectre looms large for pretty much all modern CPUs – not just Intel , but AMD , and ARM-based chips in mobile devices ( SoCs from the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung ) . As we saw this morning , Apple admitted that not just its Mac computers were affected , but also iOS devices . Where are the lawsuits against AMD , or other chip makers , then ? Maybe they ’ re still to come , and perhaps these initial lawsuits were formulated back at the start of the week when all the blame was wholly pinned on Intel for subjecting its customers to these twin vulnerabilities . Of course , getting the lawsuits to stick in terms of establishing that Intel has misled consumers , and proving any related PC slowdown , or concrete damages resulting from these bugs will likely prove tricky . Still , this is certainly another worry on Intel ’ s plate which it could well do without , and there ’ s perhaps a bigger one still . Consumer lawsuits aside , if the big cloud computing guns like Amazon , Google and Microsoft decide to press for compensation for any downtime tied into applying fixes for these flaws , that could be an entirely more costly affair . Intel has been busy firefighting this PR nightmare all week , and it seems the company will need plenty more extinguishers on hand in the near future . Meantime , other chip makers will likely be keeping as low a profile as possible . Also , the revelation that Intel ’ s chief executive Brian Krzanich allegedly sold off the majority of his shares in the company later on last year – after Intel was supposedly informed about the security flaws back in June – has added another pinch of spice to this whole affair ( as if it wasn ’ t heated enough ) . This is according to CNBC , which further notes that other reports have cited an Intel spokeswoman who said that the CEO ’ s decision to sell the shares was unrelated to this whole fracas . As a final note , if you ’ re worried about the impact of these security flaws on your own devices , check out our guide on how to protect against the Meltdown and Spectre bugs .

Intel claims to have already nipped this whole Meltdown and Spectre security hole problem in the bud , according to its latest press release on the matter . Within , Intel states that its next batch of security updates to its processors will grant them immunity to the exploits . “ Intel has developed and is rapidly issuing updates for all types of Intel-based computer systems — including personal computers and servers — that render those systems immune from both exploits ( referred to as “ Spectre ” and “ Meltdown ” ) reported by Google Project Zero . ” The release goes on to tout the ‘ great progress ’ Intel has made in just days since news of these security flaws was broken by Google Project Zero , a team of security analysts employed by Google tasked with finding zero-day vulnerabilities . By Intel ’ s measure , more than 90 % of devices running on Intel hardware will be immune to the flaws by the end of next week . Of course , this news comes after Intel has already released updates directly to its processors to combat these security holes . ( Which it still says has n't tangibly affected performance for the majority of its audience . ) This statement from Intel is aimed to double down on reassuring users that the problem is well on the way to being fixed . Indeed , as Microsoft and Google have already released fixes for preventing hackers from exploiting these flaws on devices running their software . Apple , on the other hand , has been predictably mum on how it ’ s dealing with the matter . Intel ’ s use of the word ‘ immunity ’ here should give pause , but not out of doubt in Intel ’ s engineers . Rather , because key members of Google ’ s Project Zero and data company Rambus told The New York Times that , at least in Spectre ’ s case , this flaw is at such a level that it can not be fixed by any old security patch . This is a hole baked into the very chips ’ design . So , how then can Intel claim to grant its chips immunity to this hole ? That ’ s currently uncertain , but we ’ ve contacted Intel for comment and will update this story should we receive a response . Regardless , it would be wise to download these updates as soon as they come through the update tool within your OS of choice , as this appears to be how Intel is getting these fixes to us . To do that , check out our constantly-updated guide for how to protect yourself against Meltdown and Spectre .
Lenovo has unleashed a host of new ThinkPad notebooks over at CES , all of which are equipped with Intel ’ s latest 8th-generation CPUs , along with a fresh barrage of ThinkVision monitors . Looking at the new ThinkPad X series first , Lenovo unveiled the X380 Yoga convertible ( pictured above ) with a 360-degree hinge and a 13.3-inch Full HD touchscreen . It ’ s powered by up to a Core i7 8th-generation processor with vPro tech , 16GB of system RAM and up to 1TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage . This hybrid boasts an active pen and an infrared camera for Windows Hello ( facial recognition ) login . Battery life is up to a claimed 13.6 hours , with rapid-charge topping up the battery to 80 % in an hour flat . Then there ’ s the ThinkPad X280 which runs with the same core specs as the above ( albeit the SSD isn ’ t of the NVMe variety ) , and offers a battery life of up to 13 hours . It ’ s also more svelte than its predecessor , being 20 % lighter at 1.16kg , and 15 % thinner at 17.4mm . Another security innovation with these laptops is a new webcam cover that goes by the name of the ThinkShutter , which does just what you ’ d expect , and is certainly a better solution than a piece of masking tape Pricing starts at $ 999 ( around £740 ) for the ThinkPad X280 and $ 1,459 ( around £1,075 ) for the ThinkPad X380 Yoga , with both laptops launching later this month . Indeed , all of the notebooks revealed here launch later on in January . Moving onto the ThinkPad L range , this includes fresh notebooks with 13.3-inch displays and a new Yoga model . The ThinkPad L380 has a 13.3-inch Full HD screen and can be specified with up to a Core i7 processor , 32GB of system memory , and up to a 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD . The ThinkPad L380 Yoga ( pictured above ) is the convertible spin with a 13.3-inch Full HD display , and goes with the same core spec as the L380 , with an identical claimed battery life of up to 12 hours . There are also ThinkPad L480 and L580 models which are 14-inch and 15-inch laptops respectively , again with the same core specs , except with these models you can add a second drive – a hard disk of up to 1TB or 2TB capacity respectively . Rather than integrated graphics , you can also run with a discrete AMD GPU if you prefer ( Radeon 530 ) . The ThinkPad L380 starts at $ 609 ( around £450 ) , with the L380 Yoga pitched at $ 1,049 ( around £770 ) , and the ThinkPad L480 and L580 start at $ 779 and $ 769 ( around £575 and £570 ) respectively . Lenovo has also rejigged the T series with new ThinkPad T480 , T480s and T580 notebooks . These all come with up to 8th-gen Core i7 processors with vPro , and optional discrete graphics ( GeForce MX150 ) , with an option on a 4K screen with the T580 . The latter 15-inch laptop can also be equipped with dual batteries ( 32Wh and 72Wh ) for up to 27 hours of battery life , which is some mammoth longevity . Pricing for the T480 starts at $ 989 ( around £730 ) , with the T480s starting at $ 1,269 ( around £935 ) and the T580 entry-level variant weighing in at $ 1,079 ( around £795 ) . Finally , Lenovo showed off some fresh monitors . The ThinkVision P32u is a 4K resolution 32-inch IPS monitor that delivers 99.5 % coverage of the AdobeRGB color gamut . And the ThinkVision X24 ( pictured above ) is a 23.8-inch IPS monitor with a Full HD resolution which prides itself on being super-sleek in terms of an ‘ infinity screen ’ with a 1.1mm bezel , and the display is just 4mm thick . Like all Lenovo ’ s aforementioned laptops , the ThinkVision X24 launches in January costing $ 249 ( around £185 ) , with the P32u going on sale in March priced at $ 1,349 ( around £995 ) .
After hours of silence , Intel has finally responded to reports of a critical flaw in its CPUs that had tech giants scrambling to release patches to update their systems . Despite AMD releasing a statement claiming that its processors are “ not susceptible ” to the reported flaws due to “ differences in AMD ’ s architecture ” , Intel says the issue is not “ unique ” to the company ’ s CPUs and that it is working with AMD and ARM to find a solution . Even though proof-of-concept code has been released by the researchers who discovered the vulnerabilities , dubbed “ Meltdown ” and “ Spectre ” , that shows sensitive data stored on a system is susceptible to being stolen , Intel has refuted the claim . The chip manufacturing giant claims it ’ s actually “ software analysis methods ” that could potentially see personal information pinched from a device . Reports suggesting that any patches to overcome the issue could slow down a PC 's performance by up to 30 % are also being shot down by Intel . A statement released by the company claims , “ Contrary to some reports , any performance impacts are workload-dependent , and , for the average computer user , should not be significant and will be mitigated over time . ” Intel is asking users to “ check with your operating system vendor or system manufacturer and apply any available updates as soon as they are available . ” Thankfully , Google and Microsoft are already on the job – Android phones with the latest security updates should be safe , says Google , while Microsoft has released a patch for Windows machines and should automatically update for anyone running Windows 10 . Apple has reportedly partially addressed the flaw in its recent 10.13.2 macOS update , which was released to the public on December 6 . Further tweaks will be added to the 10.13.3 update , which is currently in beta testing .

Update : Intel has issued a response to reports of a critical flaw in its CPUs , saying the issue is not `` unique '' to its processors and that it is working with AMD and ARM to find a solution . Intel 's statement also shot down claims that patching the flaw could lead to PC performance slow down by up to 30 % , saying that , `` Contrary to some reports , any performance impacts are workload-dependent , and , for the average computer user , should not be significant and will be mitigated over time . '' Intel urges users to check with their OS vendor or system manufacturer and apply updates as they arrive . Google and Microsoft are already tackling the issue , with Microsoft issuing a patch that should automatically update for Windows 10 users . Original article continues below ... A major bug in Intel ’ s processors can ’ t be fixed via a firmware update , and will require an operating system patch across Windows , Linux and macOS platforms – and the bad news is that this software patch could slow down PCs potentially by up to 30 % . There are multiple caveats when it comes to that scary looking percentage figure , which we ’ ll discuss momentarily , but there ’ s no doubting that this is a huge blunder by Intel . The Register reports that the design flaw seemingly affects all modern Intel CPUs – those produced in the last decade or so – and it gives applications the potential ability to spy inside some protected kernel memory data . That memory space should be completely inaccessible , because it could contain elements like login or password details , or other security-shaking bits and pieces . The exact details of the flaw haven ’ t been made clear to avoid giving out any more details than necessary . What is clear is that this must be fixed as soon as possible , with operating system kernels needing to be redesigned in order to completely separate the kernel ’ s memory from any user processes and programs . The problem with doing so is that this will trigger some slowdown in the CPU ’ s operation , and that ’ s where things get tricky . Depending on what particular task is being tackled , and the exact processor model involved , early benchmarks show that the software patch could trigger anything from a 5 % up to a 30 % slowdown on PCs . There ’ s a good deal of variance here , then , and as PC Gamer notes , the kernel patch probably won ’ t affect the average consumer using a PC so much , and isn ’ t likely to seriously hurt gaming and the smoothness of your frame rates . It may not even have much noticeable impact at all on the average system – enterprise users and cloud computing are more likely to be hit harder by performance slowdowns . That said , everything at this point is pretty much speculation , so we ’ ll only really know when the updates are rolled out . And that ’ s a slightly worrying prospect , of course . Aside from applying the relevant patch , the only other solution is to buy a brand-new processor which isn ’ t blighted by the bug now Intel has ironed it out – not exactly a practical prospect for most folks ( unless you were mulling over pulling the trigger on a CPU upgrade anyway ) . Microsoft is planning to deploy its update for Windows on a Patch Tuesday in the near future , while Linux developers are also beavering away on a fix . Meanwhile , the 64-bit version of macOS will also need to be updated with a fix , and presumably Apple is busy preparing that as we type . Major cloud computing services such as Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure are affected , too , and these will also require maintenance and fixes . This is all very bad news for Intel , as if the company hadn ’ t suffered badly enough on the security front last year , when several worrying ( long-standing ) security flaws came to light . We 've contacted Intel for a comment on this issue and will update the story when we hear more .

Some fresh information has emerged on Intel ’ s incoming laptop processor that runs with AMD Radeon graphics , confirming that the chip will indeed use AMD Radeon Vega graphics cores – AMD ’ s current-generation tech rather than last-gen Polaris . Additionally , we now know what exactly this processor will be called as well as its wattage and clock speed . As PC World reports , this comes from Intel India – which may even have mistakenly broke this news – and it dispels whispers on the CPU grapevine that AMD might have stuck with a Polaris GPU when it comes to Intel ’ s now so-called Core i7-8809G notebook chip due to emerge later this quarter . The Core i7 part will use the Vega in conjunction with HBM2 memory , and it ’ ll be a quad-core ( eight-thread ) processor clocked at 3.1GHz with a total TDP – or thermal design power – of 100 watts ( W ) . Theoretically , then , given that this chip has an H-series mobile CPU , which normally uses 45W , the GPU could weigh in around the 50W mark in terms of power consumption – equivalent to a beefy Radeon RX 550 . It ’ s still too early to make any real call on the sort of pixel-pushing power that might be available with this laptop processor , but this is promising news , given that the RX 550 is capable of pushing around 80 frames per second ( fps ) in Overwatch and Counter-Strike : Global Offensive , compared to under 20 fps for Intel ’ s integrated graphics ( according to AMD ’ s own figures versus an Intel HD 530 integrated solution ) . The listing for the Core i7-8809G was found on an Intel India web page detailing overclocked processors , leading to speculation that you may be able to overclock the CPU . Either that or , as mentioned , its inclusion may have simply been a mistake by the Indian arm of Intel . At any rate , you can color us excited , and it shouldn ’ t be long before we get some more concrete information on the chip . After all , it should be out in March , or indeed quite possibly earlier than that .

The PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics were an important milestone in the development of 5G , but the next summer games in Tokyo will be a demonstration of what can be achieved through next generation networks . Intel , which is an Olympic technology partner until Paris 2024 , was delighted with how its 5G trials in South Korea performed , with 22 5G links at 10 sites delivering 3,800TB of network capacity . Speaking at MWC 2018 , the company said it is already planning for Tokyo 2020 where 360-degree , 8K video will be transmitted from Japan to smartphones and VR headsets around the world through the various broadcasters . “ Instead of watching surfing from the beach , for example , viewers will feel like they 're riding the waves with the athletes , ” said Aicha Evans , chief strategy officer at Intel . Tokyo 2020 will also see smart city applications and allow athletes to gain access to eHealth technologies and data analytics that will boost performance . The official supplier for the games is Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo , which plans to launch a commercial 5G network in 2020 . Also speaking at MWC , NTT DoCoMo CEO Kazuhiro Yoshizawa said its plans for 5G were well underway and it was confident that 5G could help create new services and tackle social issues . The Olympics could be the killer app that convinces people they need the faster speeds , lower latency and higher capacity that 5G affords . “ Many people questioned the necessity when we introduced 3G and 4G but as it turns out , the adoption of social media and streaming expanded rapidly to become a ‘ must have ’ for many people ’ s lives , ” he said . “ Back then the network rolled out first and services came out late . With 5G we want people to use new services from day one . The network and services will launch at the same time . ” Yoshizawa used his keynote address to stress the need for the creation of an ecosystem that would stimulate innovation and said its programme had so far attracted interest from more than 600 partners . “ Things that were previously difficult because of the limitations of 4G are now possible , ” he concluded .

Last week , Intel released overhauled Spectre fixes for all its newest CPUs – from Skylake onwards – and now the firm has pushed out fresh patches for many Broadwell and Haswell processors too ( 5th- and 4th-gen models ) . These are working Spectre patches that don ’ t cause the instability problems which the previous fixes did , which led to Intel recommending that folks don ’ t install them . Obviously this is good news from a security point of view for those with Broadwell and Haswell chips , with Intel clarifying exactly which Core and Xeon CPUs now have fixed patches . As the Register reports , on the Broadwell front , patches are now done for processors with these CPU IDs : 50662 , 50663 , 50664 , 40671 , 406F1 , 306D4 and 40671 . And when it comes to Haswell , the following chips are now good to go : 306C3 , 4066 , 306F2 , 40651 and 306C3 . For the latest on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown , read our comprehensive guide . Note that Intel releasing these patches doesn ’ t mean you ’ ll be getting them immediately , as they have been pushed out to hardware manufacturers , and those vendors must now incorporate them in BIOS updates which will be delivered to users going forward . There ’ s a slight worry on the performance front with older processors , because these fixes may hit veteran CPUs with a greater level of slowdown , particularly if you ’ re running an older version of Windows as well ( i.e . pre-Windows 10 ) . Although we ’ ll only really know when these patches are released… That leaves only Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge CPUs which don ’ t have functional Spectre patches ( as first-gen Core processors aren ’ t affected , apparently ) . According to Intel ’ s update , these are still in beta testing , so it could be some time yet before we see deployment on that front .

Not to be outdone by Qualcomm on the always-connected PC front , Intel has revealed that it ’ s collaborating with leading PC manufacturers to bring its new 5G modem to laptops next year . The company is working with Dell , HP , Lenovo and Microsoft to realize 5G-connected notebooks powered by Intel ’ s XMM 8000 series modem , and the devices are expected to hit shelves in the second half of 2019 . Over at MWC ( Mobile World Congress ) which kicks off at the start of next week , Intel will be demonstrating a concept detachable 2-in-1 device which has an early version of a 5G modem running alongside one of the firm ’ s latest 8th-gen Core i5 processors . And the company will be showing this convertible off – and more to the point the power of 5G – by livestreaming a video to the machine over a 5G network . More broadly , Intel is pushing 5G ’ s performance chops in terms of delivering high-end online gaming experiences , as well as heavyweight video streaming , and indulging in the likes of untethered VR while on-the-move . The company observed : “ Imagine being able to continue participating in a multiplayer game as you ride in an autonomous vehicle on the way to class . Radically different . ” Intel will also be showing off the latest steps it has taken with eSIM technology at MWC , and the firm notes that as of last September , all of its modems support eSIM in the consumer and enterprise worlds . And on the Wi-Fi front , the company is set to showcase an ultra-thin PC which boasts 802.11ax connectivity , the next big step forward for Wi-Fi . Taking the baton from 802.11ac , the incoming ax standard not only promises faster Wi-Fi speeds , but improved performance in crowded environments where there are lots of competing wireless signals ( i.e . apartment blocks ) . The overall vision is a world in which you can seamlessly hop from high quality Wi-Fi to powerful cellular connections , getting speedy connectivity wherever you may be .

Intel has ironed out the bugs and released revamped Spectre fixes for all of its newest processors – those from Skylake ( 6th-generation ) onwards . That means working Spectre patches ( which don ’ t cause the stability issues that previous fixes did ) are available for Skylake ( which was previously announced ) as well as Skylake-X , Kaby Lake , and Coffee Lake CPUs . Intel Xeon Scalable and Intel Xeon D processors ( for data center use ) are also covered . You won ’ t see the patches immediately , because Intel has released these microcode updates to hardware manufacturers , and these firms then need to include them in their subsequent BIOS updates . But depending on how organized your particular vendor is , it shouldn ’ t be long before your PC has a fix . For the latest on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown , read our comprehensive guide . Now Intel just needs to crack the apparently more problematic nuts of older Haswell and Broadwell processors ( 4th- and 5th-gen ) , as well as models previous to that . Last month , Intel noted that every generation of Core CPUs were affected by Meltdown and Spectre save for the 1st-gen outing . At any rate , this looks like good timing , seeing as last week we heard about new exploits targeting the vulnerabilities which have been put together by white hat security researchers . If the good guys have done that – and successfully demonstrated an exploit on a MacBook – it ’ s likely that more nefarious types working on leveraging these bugs won ’ t be far behind . Fingers crossed , then , that Intel can manage to sort out the rest of its processors sooner rather than later . Via Tom ’ s Hardware
Updated : It looks like we may have gotten too excited about the prospects of new discrete graphics cards from Intel . The company just informed us the prototype is n't a completely new product , but rather to show off how efficient Intel can make its existing Generation 9 GPU architecture . An Intel spokesperson shared this quote with TechRadar : `` Last week at ISSCC , Intel Labs presented a research paper exploring new circuit techniques optimized for power management . The team used an existing Intel integrated GPU architecture ( Gen 9 GPU ) as a proof of concept for these circuit techniques . `` This is a test vehicle only , not a future product . `` While we intend to compete in graphics products in the future , this research paper is unrelated . Our goal with this research is to explore possible , future circuit techniques that may improve the power and performance of Intel products . '' We apologize for the error . The original article follows below ... Ever since Intel poached AMD ’ s Radeon Tech Group Leader Raja Koduri , we suspected that it would be getting into the discrete graphics world . Following a small announcement last November , we 're finally seeing the chip maker take things to the next step with a new prototype . At the IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference , Intel unveiled a prototype GPU based on a 14nm process . According to PC Watch , the prototype GPU contains 1.542 billion transistors split between two chips ; one being the actual graphics processor unit and the other a field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) . The inclusion of an FGPA suggests that this prototype GPU might be in development for workstation and server use rather than gaming or mining . Intel hasn ’ t disclosed the intentions of its prototype and has only referred to it as a proof-of-concept . Without any performance numbers , we can ’ t draw many more conclusions here either . However , as with the company ’ s processors , you can expect that GPU architecture to be as efficient as it is powerful . Regardless of which direction Intel goes , the fact that it ’ s closing in on dedicated graphics cards should make the market dominated by Nvidia and AMD a little more interesting . Via Neowin

Gaming on integrated graphics is a pain , not only for the lower frame rates and visual fidelity , but also the amount of tweaking needed to even get a playable experience . Luckily , Intel is making things a little easier with new software updates . Just like Nvidia GeForce Experience , Intel ’ s Graphics Control Panel has a new panel that will automatically optimize game settings all on its own . To gain access to the new feature , all users have to do is download the latest Intel Graphics Driver for Windows version 15.65 from the company ’ s official site . Intel ’ s updated Graphics Control Panel is available for sixth-generation Skylake processors with Intel Graphics HD 620 or higher . Kaby Lake G processors also receive the feature , but those built-in Radeon RX Vega graphics will still be managed through a reskinned ( and blue , to match Intel 's logo ) version of Radeon Settings . The new software functionality is still in beta , so it only supports a few titles including Battlefield 1 , Battlefield 4 , American Truck Simulator , Call of Duty WWII , Destiny 2 , Dota 2 , Grand Theft Auto V , League of Legends , Overwatch , and World of Tanks . Iris Pro graphics-equipped processor can optimize a few more games such as Kingdom Come : Deliverance , Street Fighter V : Arcade Edition , and Metal Gear Survive . We can expect that the number of titles Intel can support will only grow in the future , especially as Intel ’ s ambitions in the discrete graphics world develop . Via The Verge

Intel ’ s quest to produce a commercially viable quantum computer just took an impressive step forward with the revelation that it has developed a ‘ spin qubit ’ chip based on traditional silicon , in conjunction with QuTech . In other words , this points to the possibility that quantum processors will be viable using silicon and existing commercial manufacturing methods , which is obviously good news when it comes to the implementation of next-gen computing . The spin qubit concept is an alternative approach Intel is exploring for realizing quantum computing – alongside superconducting qubits – and the firm notes that it very much resembles semiconductor electronics as we know them . Spin qubits work by utilizing the spin of an electron – which can be controlled using tiny microwave pulses – and can be classified as ‘ up ’ or ‘ down ’ to correspond with the traditional binary values of 0 and 1 . But the real trick here is that the electrons can also exist in what ’ s called a ‘ superposition ’ of a spin that ’ s up and down simultaneously . And that capability adds a whole new dimension of computing , and a whole lot more power , with the ability to potentially crunch massive sets of data in parallel – and much faster than a traditional processor . Developing a functioning quantum computer is a mammoth task fraught with numerous complex challenges , but the good news about the spin qubit approach is that it offers a number of advantages over superconducting qubits . That includes the fact that silicon spin qubits are smaller and effectively stronger – in other words , with a longer ‘ coherence time ’ which will help when it comes to scaling up to a usable full quantum computer . They can also operate at higher temperatures , and as Intel explains , this “ could drastically reduce the complexity of the system required to operate the chips by allowing the integration of control electronics much closer to the processor . ” As mentioned , Intel is currently working with QuTech on this technology , and this week , at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , there will be a presentation on the successful creation of a two-qubit spin-based quantum computer which is capable of being programmed to perform a pair of simple quantum algorithms . It may be a simple first step , but it ’ s an important one . Check out the video above for a further explanation of what this is all about as detailed by QuTech . As a final note , there are those who don ’ t believe quantum computing is the best way forward – like Fujitsu , as we discussed in this article .

In a move which , at least to some extent , seems to be running interference with AMD ’ s recently released ( and well-received ) fresh APUs , Intel has unveiled a single new 8th-gen Core i3 processor aimed at ultraportable laptops and 2-in-1s . The Core i3-8130U is a dual-core CPU with four-threads , clocked at 2.2GHz with Turbo up to 3.4GHz . You get integrated graphics in the form of Intel ’ s UHD Graphics 620 ( with a base frequency of 300MHz , maximum of 1GHz ) , and the chip has a TDP of 15W . It supports DDR4-2400 system memory . The new Core i3 pretty much sticks along the same lines as its Kaby Lake predecessor , then , with the main difference being the ability to boost up to a faster speed ( the old one topped out at 2.7GHz ) , with support for slightly faster system RAM . And of course it also features the benefits of the new architecture . Intel boasts that the chip represents a “ performance jump over the previous generation ” and offers “ an overall experience that is optimized for speed and simplicity . ” The company notes that this model rounds off its initial portfolio of 8th-gen mobile processors ( first launched last August ) , and that we ’ ll see new notebooks from manufacturers using the Core i3-8130U before long .

If you were watching the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea yesterday then you might have noticed a swarm of Intel-made drones lighting up the night sky at various points – and those intelligent packs of drones broke a Guinness World Record along the way . The record-breaking segment shown at the ceremony was actually pre-recorded , and featured a total of 1,218 drones flying together in sync , more than ever before . A smaller swarm of 300 drones was also planned to entertain the crowds live in PyeongChang but ended up not happening . We 've seen these Shooting Star drones from Intel in action several times before , and their latest outing is part of a deal between Intel and the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) . The partnership covers VR tech , 360-degree videos , and of course the drone shows that wowed the audience last night . The previous record for `` most drones flown simultaneously '' was also set by Intel 's Shooting Star fleet . They followed up a show with 100 drones in Germany in 2015 with a performance featuring 500 of the bots the next year – obviously this tech is just getting smarter and smarter . Every drone fleet performance is controlled by just one pilot . The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles themselves are fitted with LED lights to produce a virtually unlimited number of color combinations , with each 384mm x 384mm ( 15.1 inch x 15.1 inch ) quadcopter weighing in at 330g ( 0.73lbs ) . `` The Olympics are a time when the sports and entertainment industries are buzzing with record-setting performances , so it was the perfect stage for Intel Shooting Star drones and our team to set their own kind of record , '' said Intel 's Natalie Cheung in a press statement .

Intel has pushed out a revamped Spectre patch which solves the previous issues that plagued the fix , but the bad news is it ’ s only been deployed for Skylake-powered PCs right now . The new patch has been cured of the previous stability issues which triggered multiple system reboots in some cases , and led to Intel recommending that users shouldn ’ t install its own fix , as you may well recall . Those who have Skylake Core or Core m processors should go ahead and install this fresh fix pronto . Although there isn ’ t any exploit targeting Spectre in the wild yet , one could be on the verge of emerging any day now . In a blog post , Navin Shenoy , executive VP and general manager of the Data Center Group at Intel , noted : “ These updates will be made available in most cases through OEM firmware updates . I can ’ t emphasize enough how critical it is for everyone to always keep their systems up-to-date . Research tells us there is frequently a substantial lag between when people receive updates and when they actually implement them . In today ’ s environment , that must change . ” For the latest on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown , read our comprehensive guide . Of course , folks would have been protected much sooner if the initial patch had worked as it should… And that ’ s still an issue for most folks , given that these stability problems potentially affect almost all of Intel ’ s processors . Initially , the company believed these gremlins only affected Broadwell and Haswell CPUs , but then it observed that ‘ similar behavior ’ occurred on all but the newest and oldest chips – i.e . 8th-generation and the very first Core processors . Other users , then , are still playing a waiting game , which is an unfortunate situation if indeed the malicious types out there are close to perfecting some sort of exploit to leverage this vulnerability . At least Skylake is now sorted , though , so that ’ s a good indicator that fixes for other generation processors are imminent . Fingers crossed , anyway . Via PC World

Image credit : Vjeran Pavic/The Verge When Google Glass first came onto the scene around 2013 , the future for smart glasses seemed bright . They were tipped to be a sleek pair of smart specs that would send you notifications from your phone , allow you to record your experiences and give you full control of their teeny tiny display with teeny tiny gestures , as well as much more . The tech was exciting , the concept was the stuff of our sci-fi dreams and with Google at the helm , what could possibly go wrong ? Well , a lot . The execution failed to live up to the hype in a multitude of ways . From the fact they looked a bit , well , naff , through to them costing well over a £1000/ $ 1000 , raising issues about privacy and consent and being worn by “ Glassholes ” . Now with a huge range of mixed reality eyewear being developed , and entering the market , there ’ s a new breed of smart glasses that have the potential to succeed where Google Glass failed . And one of the newest and most exciting prototypes comes from Intel . Developed by Intel ’ s New Design Group ( NDG ) , the latest smart glasses offering is called Vaunt . With a super simple interface , minimal design that you might actually like to wear and non-intrusive notification system are these finally the specs to bring smart eyewear to the mainstream ? Let ’ s not pretend that the way tech for your face looks isn ’ t one of the most important factors here . Especially considering the design of the Google Glass was arguably one of the main reasons it didn ’ t catch on with the general public . At around 50g the Vaunt glasses are lighter than most of the smart eyewear and AR headsets we ’ ve come across to date . But they also look very different too . Although there are a few different styles to choose from , it seems clear that NDG has taken cues from minimal , regular glasses rather than trying to create something that looks ‘ futuristic ’ ( and , in turn , ironically dated ) . It ’ s hard to say without trying a pair of the Vaunt glasses on myself , but according to first-hand reports from The Verge , they don ’ t just look like a regular pair of specs , they feel like them too . So far so good . I know what you ’ re thinking . To create a pair of glasses you might want to actually wear surely means sacrifices have had to be made to performance and tech , right ? This is where the Vaunt glasses are a little different to Google Glass , as well as other , more advanced AR headsets , like the Microsoft HoloLens . Right now they ’ re designed solely for displaying notifications and basic information directly to your eyes . In early examples that includes text messages , recipes and directions , but of course once developers can create new apps there could be lots more scope . If the idea of having all those mind-numbingly boring group WhatsApp chats delivered directly to your eyeball sounds scary , like an idea directly from the notebook of Charlie Brooker and not to mention really bloody irritating , you ’ re not alone . But ironically , tech designed to serve up notifications already on your phone elsewhere , like on a smartwatch , can actually leave you with more time and energy to experience more without looking at a screen . However , with the proliferation of wrist-bound wearables designed to show you notifications and basic data do you really want the equivalent of the Apple Watch strapped to your forehead ? Many of us may not know the answer to that question until we try it ourselves . But rather than replacing smartphone screens and being always on , there ’ s a case for them to be with you when you need them the most instead . For example , at work to access information faster , as you ’ re waiting for a flight and weighed down with luggage or cooking . The squeamish can look away now ( or not , if Intel has its way ) but the smart glasses work by using what ’ s known as a Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser ( VSCEL ) to project information onto a reflector on the right lens , which then reflects information directly onto your retina . It sounds weird , but according to reports Intel is confident such a low-powered laser is fine for your peepers . As you ’ d expect , the Vaunt specs have built-in Bluetooth smarts so that the eyewear can sync up to your phone to get the information to display for you . It also has an accelerometer so that gesture-based controls can be used to bring up or dismiss notifications . It 'll soon have a microphone , too , given we ’ re all now accustomed to barking voice commands at our tech . The way the information is displayed and the way you interact with it will largely depend on the application you ’ re using . But in early demos the projection appears in your peripheral vision , so you have to turn your eye to see it , then you can use a nod of your head to dismiss it . It may look and behave better than Google Glass already , but its lack of a camera and early , non-intrusive aims means Vaunt could address a lot of privacy worries and become much more accepted as the norm in social situations . But although many may not be able to tell the difference between Vaunt and a nice pair of specs from Specsavers , it ’ s still early days . Without social context any kind of tech on your head might take some getting used to - both from the user ’ s perspective and anyone they ’ re interacting with . Important discussions about ownership and data are already rife in the tech industry right now . But these conversations , and the regulations that come from them , need to be translated into AR and always-on headsets as well . Similarly , I ’ m not convinced that we ’ ll become accustomed to putting on a pair of glasses simply for the purpose of getting notifications . Granted , I said the same thing last year about long-term use of a smartwatch and now I ’ m a true convert . But there are important things to consider about the social norms and habitual legacy of wearing a watch that made my transition from watch to smartwatch feel natural . I ’ m not so sure even glasses wearers would feel the same way about a pair of specs like Vaunt , especially if they ’ re only going to show simple notifications . Although that ’ s better than being bombarded by ads and games and everything else , there ’ s a point where non-intrusive just becomes kind of pointless . Aside from individual user behavior , a pair of smart specs that leaves most of your vision clear could address some of the safety issues we ’ ve raised before about AR headsets . Then again , that ’ s another hypothetical . Just because a small notification in the corner of your vision sounds safer than big , augmented characters , it could still be a huge distraction when you ’ re say crossing a road . In short , on the surface Intel ’ s Vaunt doesn ’ t seem as problematic as Google Glass did . But that doesn ’ t mean we can leap into a mixed reality future head first without thinking about social context , privacy and safety . Even if the concept seems relatively simple and non-intrusive . There are plenty of reasons to get excited about Intel ’ s plans for Vaunt . But right now they ’ re only set to be released to developers so they can start making apps and services for the glasses . Although that ’ s a promising first step , it ’ s the same strategy taken by Google when it launched the early access programme for Glass . And just because Intel ’ s Vaunt glasses don ’ t look as stupid as Google Glass and may not come with the big privacy nightmares , that doesn ’ t mean we ’ ll all be wearing them in the next year . After all , head-mounted displays , from bulky VR headsets to the sleekest of smart frames , are notoriously difficult to get right because there ’ s so much to consider , from comfort and style , to how they work and whether we can move in them . In that way , like most wearable tech , whether Vaunt will be comfy and game-changing or annoying and pointless is subjective - especially so early on in the development process . But given they do look good , are simple and address a lot of the concerns of Google Glass , they have the potential to win where Google failed . But let ’ s not speak too soon . There ’ s also a good chance other companies will get there first . After all , Intel is known for building cool prototypes that don ’ t always make it to market but prove to inspire other brands . There are a lot of mixed reality and augmented reality options about to enter the market with a lot of hype , like the Magic Leap goggles or the Microsoft HoloLens visor . As well similar offerings , like the Vuzix Blade , which may look bulkier than the Vaunt but serves up some of the same features . Or maybe we ’ re getting it all wrong and Apple will soon launch an AR eyewear product to blow all the competition out of the water ? Or maybe overlaying reality with AR and notifications will never have mainstream appeal and will only have success in enterprise applications ? The tech is here , it ’ s just too early to tell how we ’ ll use it , whether we want to all use it and what it ’ ll take ( if anything ) to drum up mainstream adoption . Whatever happens we expect a lot more missed opportunities , baffling designs , promising prototypes and a hell of a lot of hype before we ’ re all wearing smart headgear .
Image credit : Vjeran Pavic/The Verge Intel has unveiled Vaunt , augmented reality ( AR ) smart glasses designed to be as unobtrusive as possible . If you can ’ t imagine wearing Magic Leap goggles or a Microsoft HoloLens visor in public , then Vaunt may be the AR solution you ’ re looking for . The last quasi-mainstream smart glasses were Google Glass , which spawned story after story of “ Glassholes ” using the built-in camera to record people without permission , or gesturing wildly in front of nonplussed bystanders . Unlike other smart glasses , which rely on outward-facing cameras and motion or touch controls , Vaunt gets rid of these features entirely . Intel ’ s New Design Group ( NDG ) is instead relying on a mixture of voice controls , AI , head motions and lasers to make Vaunt hands-free . Read on the latest news and speculation on the release date , price and potential features of the Intel Vaunt augmented reality glasses . The official developer kit will launch “ later this year ” , but Intel remains cagey on a specific date , according to The Verge . An earlier report by Bloomberg cited sources who claimed the company plans to sell a majority stake in Vaunt to a company with solid expertise in sales channels , industry or design , rather than sell Vaunt directly to consumers . Depending on how long this partner search takes and any tweaks that may happen as a result , this could delay Vaunt ’ s general release date . Still , this is unlikely to stop developers from getting their hands on the first version before the year is out . Intel also hasn ’ t revealed any Intel Vaunt price information yet . Snap Spectacles only cost $ 130 / £105 / AU $ 170 , while the Google Glass SDK was priced at $ 1,500 ( £1,000 / about AU $ 1,956 ) . Where Vaunt falls depends in part on how much the proprietary Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser ( VCSEL ) costs , compared to the built-in cameras found on most AR devices . Unlike its competitors , Vaunt 's hardware appears to be pretty minimal , since it can fit comfortably in plastic frames . The Verge ’ s Dieter Bohn , who got a first look at Vaunt , speculated that the device may rely on streaming content from apps based in the cloud , or from your smartphone via Bluetooth , to run its software . This could keep hardware requirements , as well as prices , low . We ’ ll keep our eyes out for the latest info from Intel , but we ’ re fairly confident predicting the price will be significantly lower than that of the Magic Leap One or HoloLens . While there 's no price yet for the Leap One , the HoloLens costs $ 3,000 ( £2,719 / AU $ 4,369 ) . With most AR glasses , people around you can clearly see if you ’ re checking notifications or watching YouTube during a meeting . With Vaunt , the interface is nearly invisible to everyone except the wearer . That ’ s because Vaunt uses a low-intensity laser to reflect your notifications directly into your right eye ’ s retina — except only in your peripheral vision , so it doesn ’ t impair your sight . The Vaunt will connect with both iOS and Android devices to pull the wearer ’ s notifications , similar to a smartwatch . The designers intend wearers to be able to glance quickly into the bottom right corner of their eyesight and check for news and texts , without having to visibly pull out a phone or glance at their wrist . The laser is a VCSEL — the same laser used by the iPhone X to scan your face for Animoji and Face ID — and one that Intel ’ s NDG promises is too weak to cause any retinal damage . The laser reflects off of the right lens , beaming a 400 x 150 pixel image onto the retina . Because the image sits directly on your eye , near- or far-sighted users can see the text as clearly as someone with 20-20 vision . Of course , these users will still need prescription lenses in their Vaunts to see the outside world clearly . The plastic frames house the laser on the right and the Bluetooth , processor , and other tech on the left , so the weight is balanced . The frames weigh about 50 grams , which is slightly heavier than regular frames ; by comparison , we weighed Google Glass at 42 grams . Right now , Intel is keeping the Vaunt ’ s potential features strictly hypothetical . But Itai Vonshak , head of products at NDG , described some potential use cases . A baker could ask Alexa to pull up a cookie recipe . While on the phone with your mom , a calendar pop-up will remind you that her birthday is coming up . Or , a pedestrian could stare at a restaurant and , based on their GPS position and direction they ’ re facing , receive a Yelp pop-up with reviews — without any vocal or touch commands . Vaunt ’ s AI will also be able to track subtle head movements and respond to certain commands , via a built-in accelerometer . And Intel has hinted that final models could have built-in mics to communicate with voice assistants . Of course , we haven ’ t seen how these features would work in practice yet , and the Yelp example sounds particularly difficult to pull off . But NDG claims their AI will be able to send users all sorts of “ ambient , contextual information ” based on their position and directional gaze without the user having to actually ask for it . “ If you ’ re tapping and fiddling ” to get information , Vonshak tells The Verge , “ then we ’ ve lost ” . Later this year , developers will be invited to an early access program to start working with the Vaunt directly . Intel is currently working on its first-party companion app , but the indication seems to be that most apps will probably run on connected smart devices , not to your glasses directly .

Image credit : The Verge Intel ’ s own take on smart glasses has been unveiled . It ’ s called Vaunt , and where Google Glass failed to blend into the designer crowd of eyewear , Intel ’ s attempt mostly nails that endeavor . Vaunt looks just like regular frames and a big part of that accomplishment stems from the fact that Intel ’ s glasses aren ’ t like Google ’ s discontinued project , Snap Spectacles , or Epson ’ s Moverio glasses . There ’ s no camera to peer into the world with , no buttons to scroll through menus , or much of anything else , really . Intel has discovered a way to pack in only the necessary tech , like Vaunt ’ s battery , essential sensors , and other components , into the sidearms of the glasses without ballooning their size beyond what you ’ d normally expect in a set of glasses . Beyond its smart design , Intel ’ s stands alone in this small group of experiments as the only model that can project images via lasers onto your retina , and with that , it lets you remain in the moment . Intel ’ s Vaunt glasses were intentionally made as a low-feature product , working to deliver important notifications and updates to the heads-up display as you might expect , but done in such a manner that it doesn ’ t distract you , or clue others into you being more absorbed in your tech than the conversation at hand . To passersby , it ’ s almost impossible to tell Intel ’ s Vaunt from any other set of glasses , according to The Verge ’ s first-look at the tech . The low-power class one laser built into the spectacles , which Intel says is so low-power that it doesn ’ t require certification , is tech wizardry at work . A special layer in the lens reflects the lasers into you eye , splashing the image onto your retina . It ’ s supposedly hard to notice from the outside , aside from being able to see a brief red flash from a certain angle . In terms of what the user will actually witness with Vaunt equipped , Dieter Bohn details his experience with the prototype , saying that Vaunt “ projects a rectangle of red text and icons down in the lower right of your visual field . But when I wasn ’ t glancing down in that direction , the display wasn ’ t there . My first thought was that the frames were misaligned . “ Turns out : that ’ s a feature , not a bug . The Vaunt display is meant to be nonintrusive . It ’ s there when you want it , and completely gone when you don ’ t . ” Vaunt provides the user with info much like a wearable does , except without the hassle of trying to take action on that information . Intel shared that while it envisions adding in a microphone to chat with virtual assistants , like Alexa and Google Assistant , the main focus of the glasses is to make interaction easy and best of all , not obvious enough to give away that you ’ re wearing smart glasses . Regarding Vaunt ’ s ease of use , Itai Vonshak , the head of products at Intel ’ s New Devices Group ( NDG ) , states that “ if it ’ s weird , if you look geeky , if you ’ re tapping and fiddling — then we ’ ve lost . ” There ’ s currently no release date set for Vaunt , but as it will be available for developers shortly , we 're likely to hear more about it soon .
Apple currently uses a mix of Qualcomm and Intel modems in its handsets , but for the iPhone XI , iPhone 9 and any other 2018 model Apple may exclusively use Intel ones . That should mean users of different iPhones won ’ t experience discrepancies in data speeds , as has been the case with the iPhone X , some of which have Intel modems while others have Qualcomm ones that are reportedly faster . But that ’ s unlikely to be why Apple has supposedly come to this decision ; rather its ongoing lawsuits with Qualcomm are probably a big factor . That , and the fact that Intel ’ s new XMM 7560 modem supports both GSM and CDMA radio systems , so it ’ s actually possible to use it across all regions and networks . Previously Intel ’ s modems lacked CDMA support , so Apple had to use Qualcomm for at least some of the modems . The claims of a switch to Intel-only are made in a research note from famed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo , obtained by MacRumors and 9to5Mac . But Kuo adds that it ’ s too early to tell whether Intel will maintain its position of exclusivity in the future , as Apple doesn ’ t typically like being dependent on a single company . Apple may also decide to give Qualcomm some orders in exchange for concessions in the aforementioned lawsuits , Kuo notes . The change probably won ’ t affect the new iPhone models much , but whatever modem ( s ) Apple uses there ’ s sure to be a speed boost over the iPhone X and iPhone 8 . Via The Verge
Toshiba has revealed a host of new ‘ E-Generation ’ laptops aimed at business users , all of which use Intel ’ s latest 8th-gen Core processors . There are seven new models in total which include the Portégé X20W-E and X30-E , Tecra X40-E , A50-E and Z50-E , along with the Satellite Pro A50-E and R50-E . All of these use Intel ’ s 8th-gen CPUs , as mentioned , along with DDR4 system RAM ( clocked at 2400MHz ) and a 1TB SSD . The Portégé X30-E comes with a non-reflective 13.3-inch touchscreen , and it ’ s very trim at 15.9mm thick with a weight of 1.05kg . This notebook also has integrated LTE support for working on the move – as does the Portégé X20W-E and Tecra X-40-E . Indeed , the X20W-E ( pictured here ) is even slimmer at 15.4mm , although it weighs a tad more than the X30 at 1.1kg . These are designed to be sleek and portable notebooks , and as business models , Toshiba claims they are robust , benefiting from a magnesium chassis that boasts a honeycomb design for ‘ enhanced device strength ’ . The notebooks also sport security features including a SecurePad fingerprint reader and infrared camera for Windows Hello login . All of the machines have the fingerprint sensor except for the Satellite Pro R50-E , and the IR camera is on board the Portégé X20W-E and X30-E , as well as the Tecra X40-E . The Portégé X20W-E , X30-E and Tecra X40-E with LTE will go on sale in April , with all of the other laptops – including the versions of the aforementioned models without LTE – to hit the shelves in March . Pricing is still to be confirmed .

Were you tempted by the Surface Laptop , but found the price a bit too rich for your wallet ? Then you might want to take the plunge with a new entry-level version of the notebook Microsoft has introduced priced at $ 799 ( around £560 , AU $ 1,000 ) . The new spin on the Surface Laptop , which is now on sale in the US , does come with a compromise to knock that price down , unsurprisingly – it runs with an Intel Core m3-7Y30 processor ( 1GHz base clock , capable of Turbo up to 2.6GHz ) . The previous entry-level model was built around an Intel Core i5 chip , which is a considerably more powerful CPU . That version is priced at $ 999 ( around £705 , AU $ 1,250 ) . The new model has the same base level of system RAM and storage as with the Core i5 , namely 4GB and 128GB respectively . The difference is you can ’ t specify any more than this with the new Core m3 notebook , but the Core i5 spin lets you double the system RAM to 8GB should you wish . Note that the new Surface Laptop is only available in one color – platinum – at least at the time of writing . And as we already mentioned , it ’ s only on sale in the US , although we ’ d expect it to become available in the UK and other territories in time . Hopefully sooner rather than later , although as we ’ ve seen in the past , there can sometimes be quite a delay when it comes to Microsoft ’ s hardware getting sold outside of the States . This is an interesting development coming hot on the heels of news that Microsoft ’ s Surface range suffered from stagnant sales in the last quarter ( Q2 ) . As we observed yesterday , during the previous quarter to that ( Q1 ) , Microsoft saw boosted sales to the tune of 12 % which the firm said had been driven by folks buying the new Surface Laptop . Therefore we theorized that Q2 ’ s lackluster sales might point to the initial interest in the Surface Laptop waning . And the release of a cheaper entry-level model does fit in neatly as a piece of that particular sales puzzle . That ’ s all completely in the realm of speculation , of course . What isn ’ t speculation is the fact that you can now get yourself a considerably cheaper Surface Laptop if you ’ re in the US , and come future discount events like Black Friday , we could see some seriously tempting bargains .

If you ’ ve been holding out for Intel to finally meet AMD head-on with core-crammed PC processors for the mainstream , Coffee Lake won ’ t disappoint you this year . Both VideoCardz and WccfTech have found evidence of octa-core Intel Coffee Lake S processors slated for post-June release . Reportedly uncovered through leaks in benchmarking software maker Futuremark ’ s 3DMark database , not much is known about these processors beyond base clock speeds , which could change , and the vastly more important core count . If all pans out , you ’ re looking at Intel Coffee Lake S processors capable of driving eight cores at a 2.2GHz frequency with what appears to be a 16MB cache . Read more : HP EliteBook 745 G5 Of course , neither the processor ’ s test scores nor more specific information is available at this time . Regardless , this is an excellent sign of Intel ’ s intent to compete with AMD in the high-end mainstream processor space for gamers and other hobbyist consumers with money to burn . Last year , we definitely saw Intel release an 18-core beast of a processor in the Core i9-7980XE , but that was based on Intel ’ s larger 22nm architecture , as well as its X299 chipset and motherboard series , and cost nearly thousands . On its more modern 14nm process , Intel was only able to get as far as hexa-core processors in 2017 , led by the award-winning , Z370-based Core i7-8700K for more than a thousand less . While that was able to trounce AMD Ryzen ’ s best in our tests , Intel clearly isn ’ t about to let that momentum die out . That ’ s what makes this finding so significant , that octa-core Intel processors are within reach of prospective PC builders for prices that , while still exorbitant , aren ’ t prohibitively so . However , it 's expected that these new processors will be compatible only with the upcoming Intel Z390 , also featured within this database leak – so it 'll likely be a bit pricier to get in on these processors than just the cost of the chip . According to these reports , we should expect to see Coffee Lake S land on shelves in the second half of 2018 .

A new leak has given us purported details of Intel ’ s first six-core Coffee Lake H ( 8th-generation ) mobile processors – including a top-end Core i9 model – which could be pepping up a gaming laptop near you before too long . This info comes from Cinebench benchmarks spilled by a Chinese website ( spotted by Videocardz ) which shows three six-core ( 12-thread ) models : the flagship Core i9-8950HK , along with the Core i7-8850H and Core i7-8750H . If this is on the money , the Core i9-8950HK will have a base clock speed of around 2.9GHz with boost to around 4.8GHz ( maximum on a single core ) . The Core i7-8850H will run at a base clock of around 2.6GHz , with boost to 4.3GHz , and the i7-8750H will hit 2.2GHz and 4.1GHz respectively . All of these chips run with a TDP of 45W , but there ’ s likely to be room to maneuver in terms of power usage to allow for overclocking . In the Cinebench R15 scores cited , the i9-8950HK recorded a benchmark of 204 in single-core , 1,083 in multi-core . That compares to 181 and 1,288 for the i7-8850H , and the i7-8750H hit 178 and 1,270 respectively . As you may have noticed , the multi-core benchmarks are odd results seeing as the Core i9 processor comes in with a lower score than the Core i7 models . It ’ s not clear why this is the case , and as Videocardz notes , it could be down to any number of factors and the exact configuration of the test laptops . Clearly , we ’ ll see a different picture when the finished processors are unleashed , and the Core i9 will out-power the i7-8850H . It ’ ll definitely be interesting to see by how much , and what sort of performance levels this flagship mobile chip can hit . But , even given the obvious glitch here , these results look exciting for the potential of packing much more power into notebooks with a six-core part . You might recall that both the Intel Core i7-8750H and Core i7-8850H CPUs appeared in leaked retailer product listings we saw earlier this week , including one for an MSI laptop . Hopefully that ’ s an indication that we aren ’ t too far away from seeing the launch of gaming notebooks with these processors under the bonnet .

As the company has previously indicated , Intel has redesigned its 8th-generation processors to make them bulletproof to Meltdown and one variant of Spectre at a hardware level . Intel ’ s CEO Brian Krzanich says that the re-engineered 8th-gen Coffee Lake – and also Xeon – CPUs with baked-in protection at the silicon level will start to ship in the second half of this year . That ’ s exactly what he promised in an earnings call back in January , and now we 've learned more about those plans . The initial chips to see the benefit will be next-gen Intel Scalable processors that are codenamed Cascade Lake , and Intel ’ s 8th-gen Core CPUs as mentioned . Krzanich clarified that the new integrated defenses would combat Meltdown and Spectre Variant 2 , although as expected , software patches will still be needed for these new chips to combat Spectre Variant 1 . Indeed , as we ’ ve heard previously , we may have to wait for all-new , 9th-gen chips for the latter bugbear to be addressed at a hardware level… For the latest on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown , read our comprehensive guide . So what exactly has been done inside these chips to add protection from these vulnerabilities ? Intel has redesigned the processors to add fresh protection in the form of partitioning . Krzanich explains : “ Think of this partitioning as additional ‘ protective walls ’ between applications and user privilege levels to create an obstacle for bad actors . ” Intel ’ s chief executive also reminded us that the company has now released revamped microcode updates for 100 % of its products launched in the last five years ( i.e . going back to and including Haswell , as we saw a couple of weeks back ) . Those fixes may still take their time coming to your machine though , as Intel sends them to manufacturers , who then have to deploy the updates . Although , Microsoft is lending a helping hand , too . Via Engadget

It seems that retailers have spilled the beans on the first Intel 8th-generation H-series processors , and what appears to be the first Core i9 chip for laptops . Eagle-eyed forum users at Notebook Review and Linus Tech Tips spotted Amazon listings for an MSI GS65 Stealth laptop that seems to be the successor to MSI GS63 Stealth . A closer look at the configuration options reveals a few new processor choices we ’ ve not seen before , including an Intel Core i7-8750H . Additionally , VideoCardz picked up on an international listing for a new MSI Titan laptop also featuring an Intel Core i7-8850H CPU , alongside two Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics cards in SLI . These are among the first mentions of 8th-generation Intel H-Series processors we ’ ve seen on the web . That said , these supposedly leaked retailer listings don ’ t reveal any technical details , such as the number of processor cores they ’ ll be rocking or their frequency . We can only assume they ’ ll follow in the footsteps of the Kaby Lake Refresh processors , and come equipped with at least six , if not eight , cores . Another question that remains is whether these supposed 8th-generation CPUs will be a continuation of the Kaby Lake Refresh family , or whether this will be the point at which Intel introduces the first Coffee Lake processors for laptops . Either way , gaming laptops , and notebooks in general , are about to get more interesting and powerful if these rumors prove to be true .

In a fresh move to further shore up security , Microsoft is providing Intel ’ s Spectre fix for PCs with Skylake processors running Windows 10 – with further patches to be delivered for older generation CPUs in the future . Of course , Intel is already pushing out Spectre ( and Meltdown ) patches itself , with numerous processor families seeing microcode updates released in the past few weeks ; but Intel doesn ’ t supply these directly to end users . Rather , they ’ re given to hardware manufacturers , who must subsequently incorporate these fixes into their firmware updates , test them , then release them to the actual consumer . In the case of some smaller manufacturers , that process could take some time , so what Microsoft is effectively doing here is offering another route to protect yourself . If you haven ’ t got the patch through from your hardware vendor , then you can grab it directly from Microsoft instead . The current caveat is you need to be running the latest version of Windows 10 ( Fall Creators Update ) , in which case you can snag the first patch – which covers ‘ some ’ Skylake devices – from the Microsoft Update Catalog ( it ’ s update KB4090007 ) . Microsoft doesn ’ t specify exactly which Skylake PCs will be able to apply the update currently , but coverage will broaden in time , and indeed the company will start to offer Intel ’ s patches for other Core processors , too . In a blog post , Microsoft noted : “ We will offer additional microcode updates from Intel as they become available to Microsoft . We will continue to work with chipset and device makers as they offer more vulnerability mitigations . ” For the latest on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown , read our comprehensive guide . Following Intel ’ s revamped Skylake fix – which was overhauled to resolve issues that could potentially cause system instability – the chip giant pushed out rejigged fixes for Kaby Lake and Coffee Lake CPUs , and then most recently for Broadwell and Haswell processors . So logically we can expect coverage from Microsoft to come in the same order , going forward . Meanwhile , Microsoft is still patching its Windows operating system against these vulnerabilities , as this is a two-pronged effort : both software and hardware need to be patched up . And hopefully all the holes will be covered before Meltdown or Spectre exploits are let loose in the wild ( which may not be too long , given that white hat security experts have already formulated a proof-of-concept exploit which was successfully used on a MacBook ) .

Not too long ago , Intel had released its Kaby Lake Refresh ( henceforth Kaby Lake R ) , or 8th-generation processors for laptops and tablets . At the time , they were billed as an evolution of the previous , 7th-generation chips , bringing quad-core designs to the i5 line and therefore more power . However , these chips have also been said to boost efficiency when it comes to power consumption . That said , let ’ s say you ’ re at the local computer store . In an aisle littered with choices , you ’ ve narrowed it down to one laptop , but there are two models side-by-side . One is housing an Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake ( last year ’ s 7th-generation ) processor , and another a Core i7 Kaby Lake R ( this year ’ s 8th-generation ) . With the chance to save , say , $ 100 ( or £100 ) in this case , how much more would you really be getting out of that most up-to-date model to make that extra cost worthwhile ? We ’ ve tested this real-life dilemma with three versions of the same Acer Swift 3 laptop – one with a 7th-gen Intel Core i5 , one with an 8th-gen Intel Core i5 and one with that same chip and Nvidia MX150 graphics installed – to demonstrate . As it turns out , the differences are rather striking in some areas and rather negligible in others . PCMark 8 Home 7th-gen Core i5 : 2,791 8th-gen Core i5 : 3,278 8th-gen Core i5 ( MX150 ) : 3,203 Geekbench 4 7th-gen Core i5 : 3,911 Single-Core ; 7,654 Multi-Core 8th-gen Core i5 : 4,168 Single-Core ; 14,009 Multi-Core 8th-gen Core i5 ( MX150 ) : 3,994 Single-Core ; 13,557 Multi-Core Cinebench 7th-gen Core i5 : 327 CPU ; 49 Graphics 8th-gen Core i5 : 530 CPU ; 52 Graphics 8th-gen Core i5 ( MX150 ) : 512 CPU ; 90 Graphics CPU-Z 7th-gen Core i5 : 324.3 Single-Thread ; 925.8 Multi-Thread 8th-gen Core i5 : 402.7 Single-Thread ; 1993.2 Multi-Thread 8th-gen Core i5 ( MX150 ) : 397.4 Single-Thread ; 1928.4 Multi-Thread When it comes to pure computing power output , there ’ s little doubt that the 8th generation of Intel Core is stronger than the 7th . For instance , we see here that the 8th gen all but spanks the previous in Geekbench 4 ’ s multi-core CPU test . The same is made obvious by our Cinebench and CPU-Z benchmark results : the leap from dual-core in the 7th generation to quad-core in the 8th generation is enormous . In practical use , an 8th-gen machine will render multiple streams of data far faster than the previous generation , so expect smoother video and complex image editing from such a device . However , we ’ ve noticed interesting differences between the 8th-gen model without Nvidia graphics and the one that ’ s housing an MX150 graphics chip . In almost all of these aforementioned tests , the model without dedicated graphics outperformed the one with Nvidia graphics . According to Intel , these differences amount to ‘ unit-to-unit variations ’ within a margin of error of 2 % to 3 % . All in all , we ’ re seeing a 17 % ( in PCMark 8 Home ) to an 83 % ( in Geekbench 4 ) to as much as a 115 % ( in CPU-Z ) increase in throughput between generations . That ’ s certainly nothing to scoff at for a difference in price of 100 to 200 bills . PCMark 8 Battery Life 7th-gen Core i5 : 4 hours and 25 minutes 8th-gen Core i5 : 4 hours and 26 minutes 8th-gen Core i5 ( MX150 ) : 4 hours and 14 minutes TechRadar Battery Test 7th-gen Core i5 : 6 hours and 58 minutes 8th-gen Core i5 : 7 hours and 25 minutes 8th-gen Core i5 ( MX150 ) : 7 hours and 32 minutes That said , when it comes to longevity , the latest Intel processors don ’ t enjoy nearly as incredible of an increase , but it ’ s at least a boost . In short , don ’ t expect all-day battery life just because you splurged on the model with the latest processor . In the PCMark 8 Battery Life test , we ’ re seeing gains so small that they ’ re within the margin of error ( and proof that dedicated graphics a long-lasting laptop does not make ) . In our local video playback test , however , the 8th-gen model lasted nearly 30 minutes longer , while the one with Nvidia graphics lasted more than 30 minutes longer . Of course , Intel never made a big stink about increases in lasting power when it rolled out Kaby Lake R late last year . Just don ’ t splurge on an 8th-generation Intel Core processor within a laptop model versus one with the previous version on account of battery life solely . Unsurprisingly , 8th-generation Intel Core , or Kaby Lake R , is better than the previous generation Intel Core processors by just about every measure . However , those improvements come in varying levels of magnitude , with battery life gains being the smallest . It ’ s difficult for us to say that you ’ re going to be massively rewarded for spending that extra scratch to get the latest-and-greatest , 8th-gen version of a given laptop you ’ ve been eying . Frankly , because you ’ re not : in real-world use , and for most users , you ’ re not going to see a world of difference . But , for those who work in rendering video or complex imagery with layers a la Photoshop , it most definitely pays to go quad-core if you can swing it . On that front , the 8th-generation , Kaby Lake R series of Intel Core chips delivers and then some .

Welp , so much for seeing Intel ’ s 10-nanometer Cannon Lake processors this year as the manufacturer announced that they ’ ve been delayed into 2019 . In its first-quarter 2018 earnings , the company stated that it 's “ currently shipping low-volume 10nm product and now expects 10nm volume production to shift to 2019. ” Cannon Lake delays , while disappointing , are all but too familiar , as they were originally supposed to ship as far back as 2016 . According to PC Gamer , Intel CEO Brian Krzanich attributed the Cannon Lake delay to difficulties in getting 10nm yields to where they need to be . Before launching the new platform , Intel is giving itself more time to work out the kinks in its 10nm production . Intel has also made a 'security first pledge , ' promising ‘ the best secure performance. ’ Off the back of the major Spectre and Meltdown issues , we have no doubt that Intel has implemented major revisions for large portions of its processor designs . Still , even without Cannon Lake arriving this year , Intel reported a record $ 16.1 billion in revenue and $ 4.5 billion profit . Compared to last year , that ’ s a healthy 13 % jump in revenue and 50 % increase in profit .

It seems Intel is working on a little more than a new Z390 chipset as new leaks also point to an upcoming X399 chipset for high-end desktop CPUs . A Twitter user named Momomo , posted an alleged document pulled from Intel ’ s download center that include the rumored Z390 chipset and the first ever mention of a new X399 platform . From the supported hardware details , it seems Intel ’ s forthcoming chipsets will support both existing Coffee Lake processors as well as future Cannon Lake releases . Intel Rapid Storage TechnologyVersion : 16.0.2.1086Release Noteshttps : //t.co/XFaEhIjHx5Cannon Point-H9th Gen CNLKaby Point pic.twitter.com/YTb2HEOS60April 25 , 2018 A X399 chipset would be the next logical successor to the current X299 platform that supports Skylake-X and Intel Core X processors . With that in mind , we may well see the introduction of Kaby Lake-X processors as Intel ’ s next generation of HEDT CPUs . If Intel actually goes through with releasing a new X399 chipset , it would directly clash with the X399 motherboards meant for AMD Ryzen Threadripper . The one saving grace is AMD could soon be moving onto a X499 chipset to support Ryzen Threadripper 2nd generation . Sadly , beyond names , there aren ’ t any details on what new features Intel ’ s potential Canon Lake and Kaby Lake-X platforms will bring . Via Wccftech

Fresh figures have come to light which show that AMD ’ s Ryzen processors are continuing to sell at quite some speed , with one particular model making excellent headway , and worrying Intel ’ s most popular CPUs . These statistics come from Mindfactory.de ( as spotted by Wccftech.com ) , a German retailer which has spilled the beans on processor sales before , and this time it has revealed stats on historical sales of AMD and Intel CPUs to date . Read more : AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2950X The best performer for AMD is the Ryzen 5 1600 , which is the seventh bestselling processor of all-time ( Intel holds the top six spots ) . The Ryzen 5 1600 is a six-core ( 12-thread ) CPU which can boost to 3.6GHz out-of-the-box , and can now be had for around $ 160 ( or about £145 in the UK ) following price cuts after the launch of Ryzen 2nd Generation chips . This temptingly-priced processor has sold approaching 25,000 units at Mindfactory.de in just over a year since its launch , nudging past AMD ’ s previous bestseller CPU , the FX-8350 , which has sold only slightly less . However , the difference is that the FX-8350 was released seven years ago , and only shifted 12,000 units in its first year on sale . The Ryzen 5 1600 has managed around double that in its first year , which is pretty impressive to say the least . The 1600X variant is also doing well , and makes the top 20 table for the bestselling CPUs as seen below . Of course , as mentioned , Intel still dominates the very top processors , with the six bestselling models . Its Core i7-6700K is by far the most prolific seller , shifting just over 50,000 units since launch . However , that ’ s a Skylake chip which was released towards the end of 2015 , so it has been on sale considerably longer than the Ryzen 5 1600 . At this point , we need to give ourselves a reality check , and remember that this isn ’ t a picture of the overall processor market . Far from it : obviously this is just a small sample – a sample of one single retailer in fact – so you can ’ t go putting too much stock in the stats . That said , the figures do give us some interesting clues as to how Ryzen is performing , and it seems that AMD is continuing to make good ground . Particularly when you consider the previous figures from this German retailer which showed that in August last year , AMD ’ s overall processor sales actually outstripped Intel ( accounting for 56 % of sales ) . That backed up what AMD ’ s CEO Lisa Su claimed in October last year when the company revealed its Q3 financials – namely that Ryzen desktop processors represented around 40 to 50 % of sales at some online retailers ( although she didn ’ t specify which outlets , it ’ s a fair bet Mindfactory.de was one of them ) .

The AMD Ryzen 7 2800X was suspiciously absent in the Ryzen 2nd Generation launch lineup , and now the chipmaker has teased that it has saved its best for last . Speaking to Tech Power Up , AMD Senior Vice President Jim Anderson hinted that we might see a Ryzen 7 2800X processor released at a later date . The main reason for the delay supposedly being that the Ryzen 7 2700X already trounces the Intel Core i7-8700K in performance to price . Without another higher-end consumer processor to compete with , there really isn ’ t any reason for AMD to throw down an even faster chip . Furthermore , with looming rumors that Intel will introduce an eight-core Coffee Lake S CPU , AMD may well be holding back its flagship chip to see what Team Blue does first . We don ’ t often speculate , but this is one of the rare times we would put a rumor in the “ you better believe it ” category . A fight between Intel ’ s first consumer-grade octa-core processor and AMD ’ s best Ryzen 2nd generation processor will be a spectacle to behold . Via The Inquirer

Intel will no longer work on its smart glasses initiative and will be closing the doors of its wearables division , it has been revealed . In a new report by The Information , it is thought that Intel will walk away completely from the hardware part of the wearables market , which would mean that its Vaunt smart glasses concept won ’ t be released and work on its AR projects is to cease as well . Given this area of its business houses around 200 people , it is a big chunk of Intel that will no longer operate . Intel isn ’ t a big name in the wearables market , but it has tried to enter the area . Back in 2014 , it bought wearable maker Basis but it ended up winding up that part of the business in 2016 . This was after it had to recall the Basis Peak when reports came in of the smartwatch overheating . It instead pushed its efforts into the AR space and added its chips to the Tag Heuer Connected range of smartwatches and also working with the likes of New Balance and Oakley . It was thought the company was done with wearable hardware , until earlier this year The Verge got its hands/face on the Intel Vaunt , a pair of smart glasses that actually looked like glasses . This and its continued push into augmented reality did make the world think that it was dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what wearables can do , but now this does n't seem to be the case .

Intel could soon have eight-core processors to rival AMD ’ s Ryzen 2nd generation CPU lineup . Redditor Dayman56 sniffed out three internal documents referencing ‘ Coffee Lake S 8+2 ’ parts that could point to the company ’ s first eight-core mainstream processors . The ‘ 8+2 ’ naming likely refers to eight-cores paired with two-integrated GPU cores given that the current Intel Core i7-8700K processor labeled with a 6+2 processor configuration . The trio of documents – which were locked behind an Intel login and have been since removed as of this writing – outlined technical elements including the mechanical packaging of the chips and DDR4 memory support . Although there isn ’ t any mention of chipset or compatible motherboards , we highly suspect these processors will be introduced along a new Z390 motherboard . Rumors about the new 300-series chipset have been swirling since mid-last year with leaks of motherboards from SuperMicro and BioStar . Now as for what generation these eight-core processors might fall under , they will likely sit in the same 8th generation umbrella for the current Coffee Lake processors . We imagine the processors could be an extension of the existing lineup as a new Intel Core i9 for Intel ’ s mainstream series . Via ExtremeTech
Intel has announced new technology for its processors to help combat malware more effectively , and to improve the performance of a PC while doing so by offloading virus scanning duties to the integrated GPU . Intel explains that its new Threat Detection Technology ( TDT ) uses functionality built-in at the silicon-level to help defeat exploits , and the first line of defense introduced is something called Accelerated Memory Scanning . Rick Echevarria , VP of platform security at Intel , stated : “ Current scanning technologies can detect system memory-based cyber-attacks , but at the cost of CPU performance . With Accelerated Memory Scanning , the scanning is handled by Intel ’ s integrated graphics processor , enabling more scanning , while reducing the impact on performance and power consumption . ” Intel ’ s own early tests show that the amount of processor resources used in scanning drops from 20 % to 2 % in the best case scenario , which is obviously a huge step forward in terms of efficiency . Less CPU usage will in turn help on the power consumption front , of course , so hopefully this could mean a little bit of extra battery life when it comes to the likes of notebooks . This technology will be available to those who are running 6th-generation Intel processors or newer , so in other words , Skylake and onwards . Other firms could also be able to benefit from Accelerated Memory Scanning , and on the software front , Microsoft is going to integrate this tech into Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection ’ s antivirus armoury . Furthermore , Intel also took the wraps off Advanced Platform Telemetry , another security-oriented tech driven by machine learning and capable of detecting advanced threats ( while minimizing any false positive detections ) . This is aimed at businesses , though , and will be used by Cisco ’ s Tetration platform ( which delivers security for data centers ) . Obviously , all this goes some way to underlining how hard Intel is working to make its processors more secure , in light of the recent chaos caused by the far-reaching Spectre and Meltdown bugs . Threat Detection Technology ’ s toted performance improvements certainly won ’ t hurt in fighting all the flak Intel has had fired at it over the slowdown caused by the Spectre and Meltdown patches , which could have a substantial impact on some systems .

Intel 's re-entry into the world of dedicated graphics cards almost seems inevitable and now there are at least three reports that seem to back up the theory . Motley Fool analyst Ashraf Eassa claims Intel is splitting its Arctic Sound – the alleged codename of Intel ’ s forthcoming discrete GPU – team to develop for gaming on top of its original intent to create data center video streaming apps . Bonus : Apparently @ Rajaontheedge is redefining Arctic Sound ( first Intel dGPU ) , was originally targeted for video streaming apps in data center , but now being split into two : the video streaming stuff and gaming . Apparently wants to “ enter the market with a bang. ” April 6 , 2018 Further backing up this rumor , both Forbes and Tweaktown claim to have confirmed that Intel is indeed working on a discrete graphics card for gaming . Both reports suggest that Raja Koduri , vice president of the Core and Visual Computing Group at Intel , is building a ‘ great team ’ for such an effort . Coincidentally , the company is hiring no less than 102 engineers , developers and other great minds for its graphics-centric project . All signs seem to point to Intel getting back into the graphics world and specifically for gaming – and honestly it makes a lot of sense . Although , Intel is fully established itself in the processor world , for the last few years it has been diversifying into other avenues such as Optane memory and SSD storage . Graphics cards seems like the ultimate venture for Intel to explore with gaming and , to our chagrin , bitcoin mining making them sell like hotcakes . Plus , with Nvidia and AMD being the only two big names in GPUs , this segment of PC components really could use a new player .

When we first heard of Intel ’ s H-series Coffee Lake processors for laptops , we had a hunch it would include some of company ’ s first hexa-core CPUs . But , we never expected Core i9 to make the jump to laptops . On desktops , high-end processors , like the Intel Core i9-7980XE , have brought the highest-core counts we ’ ve seen on consumer chips and the greatest multi-core performance we ’ ve tested . In similar fashion , the top-of-the-line chip boasts a six-core and 12-thread arrangement for the first time on a mobile part , with the addition of higher clock speeds up to 4.8GHz , thanks to its fully unlocked status . Intel claims that its Core i9-8950HK is the best gaming and content-creation laptop processor it has ever built . Even amongst its 8th generation H-series brethren , this top-end part is claimed to deliver at least 10 % more performance than the second-most powerful Intel Core i7-8850H . Of course , there ’ s always a greater story behind any legendary leap forward such as this , and Fredrik Hamberger , general manager of premium and gaming notebooks at Intel , is excited to tell all . “ We saw the demand from our highest-end enthusiasts for more performance , ” Hamberger says , explaining the origins of the first mobile Core i9 processor . “ They wanted something more , different and higher-end than just what we were scaling with our entire category . ” “ So , we looked at that and we had an opportunity to squeeze a little more out of our process and by doing some unique things , like Thermal Velocity Boost . ” Just what is Thermal Velocity Boost ( TVB ) anyway ? It ’ s basically a feature that allows Intel ’ s top-end processor to achieve an additional 200MHz of additional frequency on top its standard 4.6GHz Turbo Boost . “ By taking advantage of the fact that , at lower temperatures , you can actually achieve higher frequencies , ” Hamberger explains , “ we ’ ve done some tweaking to our process and microcode to enable an additional boost in frequency when the processor temperature allows . “ Like most of Intel ’ s Turbo Boost technology , Thermal Velocity Boost turns on automatically applies the 200 extra megahertz of additional frequency as long as a workload – such as a video encode or rendering 3D models – requires it and the chip is operating at 50-degrees Celsius or lower . As Hamberger explains it , TVB is centered around burst workloads rather holding a sustained overclock for tasks such as gaming . “ As the part heats up , you might drop down to only 100MHz of additional frequency and when it reaches something above 70- or 80-degrees Celsius you might not get that any additional speed , ” Hamberger says . Still , you can expect the chip to operate at its guaranteed turbo boost frequency of 4.6GHz up to 100-degrees Celsius . Any hotter than that , and you ’ ll most likely have other problems on your hands . Following our talks with Intel , it is abundantly clear that the ultimate goal of its new Intel Core i9 chip is to bring the power of desktops to the laptop . The concept isn ’ t exactly new to the mobile space : over the years , we ’ ve seen plenty of manufacturers implement desktop processors into gaming laptops , such as the Origin EON15-X . Intel , being the actual maker of the processors , wasn ’ t about to just ramshackle a desktop-level part into a notebook . Rather , it engineered a chip completely designed for mobile with a thermal design and power delivery that notebooks could support . “ We saw the wish for power and performance and that ’ s what we ’ re trying to deliver , giving them as much as we can in a mobile-friendly form factor , ” Hamberger tells us . “ You get that better form factor , battery life and tuning that you wouldn ’ t get with a socketed part in a notebook chassis . ” “ If you look at what we did with our highest-end performing SKU . The Core i9 is on par with last year ’ s desktop chip . For the most part , Hamberger sees musclebook – a new phrase Intel has coined for thicker workstations and gaming notebooks – users being able to take the full advantage of Core i9 ’ s overclocking capabilities as they offer a higher level of cooling , allowing for TVB to kick in more often . That said , there will also be thinner laptops capable of supporting Intel ’ s highest-end chip , such as the Dell XPS 15 . “ It ’ s also going to show up in the sub 20mm category that has thinness and greater battery life than six hours , ” he says . If you look at the history of silicon in computers , there ’ s always been a trickle-down effect , especially in Intel ’ s case . Intel Core i9 , and the greater Core X series , brought server capability into a desktop format with megatasking . Now , Intel Core i9 brings the performance of a desktop and server-borne megatasking to notebooks , all within the company ’ s first hexa-core processors for laptops . Here ’ s to hoping the trend continues and we see mobile CPUs with eight or more cores in the near future .

Before the release of Coffee Lake in October 2017 , Kaby Lake was the wildly successful follow-up to Intel ’ s Skylake CPUs . Kaby Lake was particularly noteworthy because it was behind many of the best laptops and desktop PCs of 2017 , like the Dell XPS 13 and the MacBook Pro . Kaby Lake took the world by storm . Sadly , Kaby Lake has been a confusing generation , even to the most tech savvy among us . This is mainly because Intel abandoned its longstanding ‘ tick-tock ’ generational model where it would alternate between optimizing the architecture of the best processors and shrinking their manufacturing process each year . Instead , Intel has released the 7th and 8th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs as the third and fourth generations using Intel ’ s 14nm process , respectively . Intel followed the 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs by releasing its 8th-generation Kaby Lake R CPUs for laptops . Intel has also recently implemented hyperthreading capabilities in its Core i3 processors for notebooks . In October 2017 , Kaby Lake R CPUs were succeeded by 8th-Generation Coffee Lake H-series CPUs , which are bringing intensely powerful 6-core , 12-thread Core i9 processors to a laptop near you . Kaby Lake was also victim to the Spectre and Meltdown exploits , but Intel says a fix is on the way . If all of this sounds confusing , don ’ t worry , we ’ ve taken the time to write up everything you need to know about Intel Kaby Lake – from price to availability to the range of processors available . After Kaby Lake released back in 2016 , we saw PC makers as reputable as HP , Dell and Lenovo launch their own Kaby Lake-packed laptops and PCs . Even though it used to be considered the standard for Intel processors in early 2017 , Kaby Lake has since been succeeded by Kaby Lake Refresh and Coffee Lake . If you ’ re thinking , “ Wait , isn ’ t Coffee Lake the name of Intel ’ s 8th-generation architecture ? ” , you would be right , although the Santa Clara chipmaker has come out and said that it plans on releasing three different CPU architectures under the 8th-gen umbrella , namely Kaby Lake Refresh , Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake . If you ’ re confused , you ’ re not alone . Intel apparently had to “ reimagine what ‘ generation ’ means ” , according to Tom ’ s Hardware . Regardless , what you need to know here is that Kaby Lake Refresh is coming to laptops and Ultrabooks near you , while Coffee Lake is focused on desktops . Cannon Lake , on the other hand , will be here later , most likely in the latter half of 2018 . Outside of mobile , there are well over 20 Kaby Lake chips now on the market . From the Celeron G3930 to the Core i7-7700K , practically all the choices you had last generation are still present , albeit with better power efficiency and even a slight spec boost . The Core i7-7700K is the flagship processor this time around , unlocked for overclocking as indicated by the discrete `` K '' moniker . Like the generations before it , the Kaby Lake architecture opts for a numerical naming convention : it consists of the “ 7 ” series CPUs to Skylake ’ s generation 6 , Broadwell ’ s gen 5 and so on . However , Intel is trying something with Kaby Lake that ’ s practically unprecedented . By refreshing its 7th-generation processors with more cores , better clock speeds and improved graphics , the company has been able to create an entirely new generation out of its Kaby Lake processors as well , hence the Core i7-8550U being used in the new HP ProBooks . As far as Intel ’ s 7th-gen mobile processors are concerned , the most powerful lie in the “ H ” series , consisting mainly of the Intel Core i7-7700HQ and the Intel Core i7-7820HK . The former can be found in the 15-inch MacBook Pro while the latter is featured predominately in high-end gaming notebooks like the Alienware 17 R4 . At Intel ’ s low- to medium-power range , there ’ s the Core i7-7500U , which initially leaked alongside the i7-7700K , but has since been found in the HP Spectre x360 as well as the Razer Blade Stealth . Intended for Ultrabooks on the top-end , this is a relatively high performance chipset , but still belongs to the `` U '' ultra-low voltage family . Meanwhile , Intel ’ s 8th-generation Kaby Lake processors marked the debut of quad-core processors for Ultrabooks . These include the top-end Intel Core i7-8550U , which operates at a base clock speed of 1.8GHz and a boost speed of 3.7GHz . As for the graphics , you can expect integrated UHD Graphics 620 from Intel . Further on the mobile front , the higher-end Core m5 and m7 mobile chips of the past are now being interspersed into the Y-series Intel Core family . These include the Core m3-7Y30 , the Core i5-7Y54 and the Core i7-7Y75 , which are being used in top-end laptops with fanless and convertible designs to complement the more power-hungry U-series processors . Many of Intel ’ s 7th- and 8th-generation selections also support Optane , a memory technology that brings hard drive speeds up to par with that of SSDs . Where have these chipsets ended up ? Well , they ’ re currently featured in a long list of notebooks , several of which we ’ ve already reviewed . The aforementioned Razer Blade Stealth and HP Spectre x360 are joined by the likes of the Lenovo Yoga 720 among many other Ultrabooks , 2-in-1s and full-on laptops . The MacBook Pro , too , has been given the Kaby Lake treatment , though our review of that model is pending . Because the “ H ” series Kaby Lake processors typically used in the 15-inch MacBook Pros weren ’ t available at the time of its release , Apple ’ s late 2016 laptops were still clinging to Skylake up until being hastily refreshed at WWDC 2017 . Other laptops equipped with Kaby Lake processors include the new 2-in-1 Dell Latitude 7285 featuring WiTricity magnetic wireless charging and the acclaimed Samsung Notebook 9 Pro convertible laptop . Plus , there are even more Kaby Lake-based laptops expected just around the corner , like the Surface Book 2 . Cannonlake is likely to prove a much more exciting update than Kaby Lake and even Coffee Lake thereafter . You see , Kaby Lake is very similar to the Skylake family we 're already using . This is not what we originally expected of the Skylake successor , but Intel has changed how its processor development works . Since 2007 , Intel has worked in a 'tick , tock ' rhythm of upgrades , where one generation shrinks the die , followed by a generation that alters the architecture . That changed this year . As of 2016 , Intel now uses a `` Process , Architecture , Optimization '' approach , and Kaby Lake represents that last , frankly least interesting stage . It 's still a 14nm processor that ’ s fairly similar to Skylake throughout , and the desktop variants will use the same LGA 1151 socket . Unless something goes terribly wrong , Cannonlake will shrink Intel CPUs down to the long-promised 10nm die in 2018 . While there are some performance improvements in store , it seems unnecessary for those with a Skylake CPU to upgrade to a Kaby Lake processor of the same level . That said , there are more options this time around , with higher end Kaby Lake-X CPUs making an impression . Despite not being the most thrilling generation of processors , there are some distinct improvements that inhabit Intel ’ s Kaby Lake CPUs . The first is fully integrated support for USB-C Gen 2 . Skylake machines can offer this already , but need an extra third-party piece of hardware . Now , its “ native ” . Again , not exciting , but it is necessary . Gen 2 USB 3.1 enables bandwidth of 10Gbps , rather than 5Gbps . Thunderbolt 3 support is in , too . In a similar vein , HDCP 2.2 support is native in Kaby Lake . This digital copy protection is a newer version designed for certain 4K video standards . Ultra HD Blu-ray is the key one , though 4K Netflix on Windows 10 also requires a Kaby Lake processor . That ’ s right , Kaby Lake also offers integrated GPUs better-suited to 4K video . Thanks to a new media engine built on a Gen9 graphics architecture , users can edit real-time 4K video using nothing more than integrated graphics . For video consumption , the new VP9 and HVEC 10-bit decode will enable all-day 4K video streaming on a single charge . And then to build on top of that dedication to better integrated GPUs , Intel has announced Kaby Lake G series CPUs that will feature integrated AMD Vega graphics to further push into a high-definition future . Better yet , Intel ’ s 8th-gen processors bring integrated UHD Graphics , designed to enhance the playback of 4K video . As a result , an Ultrabook using 8th-gen chips can display across three 4K monitors at once or even power a Windows Mixed Reality headset . It should also be noted that 8th-generation Kaby Lake processors are said to be 40 % faster than their 7th-gen counterparts . Kaby Lake only officially supports Windows 10 among Microsoft ’ s operating systems . This is yet another attempt by Microsoft to push those lingering on Windows 7 , or anything a little older , into the present . It 's also worth considering the low-end Atom chipsets you 'll see used in very cheap laptops , Windows 10 tablets and low-power mini PCs Intel calls NUCs ( Next Unit of Computing ) . Although they ’ re not part of Kaby Lake , the latest “ Apollo Lake ” chips started to appear in late November , with Asus and HP being among the first to implement them . These , too , are capable of 4K video playback acceleration by way of the HEVC and VP9 codecs . This is due in part to the move from Gen 8 to the Gen 9 graphics found in Skylake processors . If you 're only interested in mainstream Kaby Lake models , the future is n't looking too complicated . They 're trickling out , before being replaced by Cannonlake CPUs in late 2018 . However , the outlook for seriously high-end hardware is more convoluted . As of a couple of months ago , the newest high-end CPUs were part of the Broadwell-E series , even though among mainstream processors Broadwell is already old news . But in June , Intel released its more powerful Skylake and Kaby Lake “ X ” series processors , the latter of which comes in two flavors : Both of these bear TDP ratings of 112 Watts in addition to supporting quad-channel DDR4-2666 memory . They ’ re still built on the same 14nm manufacturing node as less “ X-treme ” Kaby Lake chips , but they ’ re very obviously geared towards gamers seeking a “ great VR experience , ” as all of Intel ’ s marketing materials would suggest . What mere mortal laptop and desktop buyers need to take from Kaby Lake , though , is that a . ) we 'll see even more machines using the new chipsets very soon and b . ) unless you don ’ t want to upgrade to a new motherboard , you might want to see if 2017 ’ s Intel Coffee Lake will serve your needs better .

A host of new Asus laptops for gaming have been unleashed , all of which are powered by Intel ’ s newest 8th-gen Core processors , along with a couple of fresh desktop PCs aimed at churning out solid frame rates as well . Heading up the pack is the impressive sounding Asus ROG Zephyrus M ( GM501 ) , which the company notes is the slimmest gaming notebook in the world that packs an 8th-gen ( up to ) Core i7 processor twinned with GeForce GTX 1070 graphics . Read more : Asus ROG Strix XG35VQ This 15.6-inch notebook features an IPS display with a 144Hz refresh rate and 3ms response time , as well as Nvidia ’ s G-Sync technology for combating stuttering and tearing . It boasts 16GB of DDR4 2666MHz system memory , with storage provided courtesy of a 256GB NVMe PCIe SSD backed up by a 1TB SSHD ( a hybrid hard drive featuring 8GB of flash cache to speed it up a bit ) . A nifty ‘ Active Aerodynamic System ’ has also been implemented to help keep this notebook cool . Asus also announced the ROG Zephyrus ( GX501GI ) , a beefed up spin on the Max-Q packing Zephyrus GX501 we reviewed last November . It ’ s also a 15.6-inch model with a slim profile and the same IPS panel as the aforementioned Zephyrus M , plus the nifty cooling system . Performance has been turned up a notch with the incorporation of an 8th-gen ( up to ) Core i7 CPU alongside the GPU which is a powerful GeForce GTX 1080 . Next up we have a fresh version of the Asus ROG G703 , which again sports Intel ’ s latest 8th-gen CPUs , except in this case you can bag yourself a factory-overclocked Core i9 processor , running alongside a GeForce GTX 1080 . This machine has a 17.3-inch anti-glare IPS screen , again with a 144Hz refresh rate and 3ms response time , plus G-Sync technology . Storage is blazing fast , too , with RAID 0 SSD speeds of up to 8700MB/s promised by Asus , which the company observes is the fastest ever seen in a notebook . Asus further revealed a fresh spin on the ROG Strix SCAR Edition , which is aimed at esports types who enjoy a spot of Overwatch or Counter-Strike . This model now packs an 8th-gen ( up to ) Core i7 processor with a choice of Nvidia GeForce 10-series graphics , and features that IPS display with a 144Hz refresh rate , 3ms response time and G-Sync . The ROG Strix Hero Edition , which Asus crafted with MOBA addicts in mind , has also been juiced up with 8th-gen ( up to ) Core i7 processors , although otherwise the spec remains the same as the previous ( current ) version . On the desktop gaming PC front , Asus revealed the ROG Huracan ( G21 ) , which you won ’ t get any prizes for guessing is driven by an 8th-gen Intel Core i7 processor , with a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU . This PC boasts a 2.5-inch hot-swap bay for an SSD , meaning you can easily switch your solid-state storage around without turning the machine off , should you wish . It also has a slide-open chassis with a side cover that can be easily opened to generate better airflow and cooling . And finally , the ROG Strix GL12 is another desktop which features up to an 8th-gen Intel Core i7 processor plus GTX 1070 graphics , again with a hot-swap bay for an SSD . Asus says that all these gaming systems will be available from the end of April , with pricing to be confirmed .

Intel isn ’ t going to patch some of its older CPUs which are vulnerable to the Meltdown and Spectre flaws , according to a fresh update issued by the company . The first thing to note here is that the processors in question are niche , older models , but this is still a potential fly in the ointment for some folks who are still using the silicon in question . Read more : HP Spectre Folio As the Register reports , the processors which won ’ t be getting a patch include chips in the Bloomfield , Clarksfield , Gulftown , Harpertown Xeon C0 and E0 , Jasper Forest , Penryn , SoFIA 3GR , Wolfdale and Yorkfield families ( and Xeon variants ) . That means CPUs which run the gamut across Core , Xeon , Pentium , Celeron and Atom chips . For example , the Bloomfield processors in question are high-end first-generation models : the Intel Core Processor Extreme Edition i7-975 and i7-965 , and Core i7-920 , 930 , 940 , 950 , 960 ( alongside Xeon offerings ) . There are over 230 affected CPUs in total . For the latest on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown , read our comprehensive guide . Why aren ’ t these being patched ? Intel gives several reasons , the foremost being that the ‘ micro-architectural characteristics ’ of these processors mean that it ’ s not actually possible to patch against Spectre Variant 2 . Intel also notes that there is ‘ limited commercially available system software support ’ for these chips these days . In other words , the firm ’ s line of thinking seems to be that even if it did produce a fix , manufacturers would be unlikely to deploy it for products which have effectively fallen by the wayside in terms of support . A third point that the chip giant makes is that many of the computers running these processors are ‘ closed systems ’ not connected to the outside world and so unlikely to be exposed to Meltdown and Spectre anyway . Intel has provided the following statement concerning the updates ( or lack of ) : “ We ’ ve now completed release of microcode updates for Intel microprocessor products launched in the last 9+ years that required protection against the side-channel vulnerabilities discovered by Google . `` However , as indicated in our latest microcode revision guidance , we will not be providing updated microcode for a select number of older platforms for several reasons , including limited ecosystem support and customer feedback . ” These are fair enough points to make , although the admission that it simply isn ’ t possible to patch against Spectre for some of Intel ’ s chips may raise a few eyebrows , and certainly points to how deep this particular vulnerability runs in the silicon .

Intel is poised to continue its dominance of the mobile computing world in 2018 with the release of new Coffee Lake H-series and U-series Intel Core processors , Core i9 CPUs for laptops , and Intel Optane taking over mobile memory . All three new types of product are designed to give Intel what it needs to deliver top-tier performance for every laptop price point , purpose and form factor – and based on Intel ’ s promises and early hands-on time with several of these 8th-generation and Core i9 laptops , Intel seems well on its way to delivering . Read more : Intel Core i9-9900K Starting with the fun stuff , Intel Core i9 brings the firm ’ s most powerful CPU into the mobile space . The one and only Core i9 processor is the i9-8950HK , clocked at 2.9GHz and maxing out at 4.8GHz across its six cores and 12 threads . The processor has a relatively massive 12MB cache , and is unlocked for overclocking . Clearly , the idea with this processor is to bring desktop , hexa-core power to gaming laptops and prosumer devices . Laptops we ’ ve seen already that possess this power include the Asus ROG G703 , Aorus X9 DT and MSI GT75 Titan . Acer Aspire Nitro 5 – $ 749 ( about £530 , AU $ 980 ) Sporting a faux carbon fiber lid , the Acer Nitro 5 will be one of the more affordable Intel 8th-gen H-series laptops available starting this month . Acer Aspire 7 – $ 849 ( about £600 , AU $ 1,110 ) Meanwhile , Acer 's more business facing Aspire 7 brings the same level of performance to a more professional device plus higher-tier Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti graphics . MSI GS65 Stealth – $ 1,799 ( about £1,280 , AU $ 2,350 ) The MSI GS65 is fresh , more minimalistic take on the brand 's classic Stealth series featuring an even thinner chassis and smaller bezels . MSI GT75 Titan – $ 2,399 ( about £1,710 , AU $ 3,120 ) On the opposite end of the portability equation , the MSI GT75 Titan is one of the first of three gaming laptops to feature an Intel Core i9 processor for true overclocking potential . Asus ZenBook Pro UX550 The Asus ZenBook Pro UX550 is one of the thinnest laptops that will features an H-series Coffee Lake processor Asus ROG G703 The Asus ROG G703 pairs up the new Intel Core i9-8950HK processor with Nvidia GTX 1080 for unparalleled performance in a gaming laptop . Samsung Odyssey Z 15 The Samsung Odyssey Z 15 was one of the only wholy new gaming laptops we saw rocking Intel 's new H-series Coffee Lake processors . HP Omen 15 The HP Omen 15 is not only of the brands first laptops to feature a hexa-core Intel Core processor , but also a Nvidia GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU . HP Omen 17 Featuring the same choices in processors , the HP Omen 17 also sports a larger 17.3-inch screen . Gigabyte Aero 15X - $ 1,999 ( about £1,420 , AU $ 2,610 ) Sporting a new logo and 0.1-inch thinner design , the Gigabyte Aero 15X continues the series ' tradition of being of the most affordable and potent gaming laptops in the world . Aorus X9 DT - $ 2,599 ( about £1,850 , AU $ 3,390 ) The Aorus X9 DT is the last of the four laptops to feature Intel 's Core i9 processor and to top it off this gaming laptop is equipped with a real mechanical keyboard and Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics . ASUS TUF FX504 - From AU $ 1,599 ( about £875 , US $ 1,233 ) ASUS is using Intel ’ s mobile chip launch to kick off a new range of laptops under its The Ultimate Force ( TUF ) branding . The TUF FX504 will be available from the end of April in Australia only , for the time being . MSI GE73 Raider - 1060 FHD AU $ 2,799 ( about $ 1,529 US $ 2,149 ) The update to MSI ’ s competitively priced GE gaming laptops , sees the full range of 17-inch models updated with new Core i7 mobile processors . All models are now available for pre-order globally . Unlike the laser focus on enthusiast gaming of Core i9 on mobile , Intel looks for its Coffee Lake H- and U-series to improve upon the experiences of all gamers and general users , respectively . The H series of Intel Core processors brings hexa-core design to Intel Core i7 chips for the first time in the i7-8850H with a 2.6GHz clock speed that boosts to 4.3GHz when needed with a 9MB cache in tow . These hexa-core CPUs should make managing multiple units in strategy and other similar games much more efficient . Intel ’ s Coffee Lake U-series , however , simply doubles down on the power of 8th-gen Kaby Lake R with more quad-core chips that range in clock speed from 2.3GHz to 3.0GHz and cache size from 4MB to 8MB . By Intel ’ s measure using a Core i5-8400U processor , this chip is 2.5x more responsive and 2.1x faster in office productivity tasks than a five-year-old system . The new U-series also integrates updated Iris Plus graphics . To make those gains feel even greater , Intel has brought its Optane high-speed memory to laptops through both direct Optane SSDs , like the Optane SSD 800p , as well as Optane hybrid drives for disk drives paired with SSDs . According to Intel , the gains amount to 1.3x performance improvement in data writing and retrieval-related tasks , and 4.7x faster level loading in games . Intel hasn ’ t laid out pricing expectations for any products containing these new processors or storage improvements , leaving that up to individual device makers . Expect to see laptops with these new processors inside laptops priced from around $ 500 / £400 / AU $ 650 starting very soon .
On top of announcing the first Intel Core i9 processors , the chip-maker took to filling out the rest of its Coffee Lake desktop CPU line . Unfortunately , there aren ’ t any new high-end or extreme processors in this announcement . There 's a new non-K version of the Intel Core i5-8600 that still comes with six cores and six threads , while below that are the Intel Core i5-8500 and Core i3-8300 to round out the series . There ’ s also a full suite of new low-power T-series chips destined for the next generation of all-in-one PCs , which will likely include a new iMac this year , and perhaps an update to the Surface Studio . Despite being designed to sip power , it seems that the T-series of Coffee Lake processors will inherit the higher thread and core counts of their forbears . Starting in April you can also expect to see more affordable motherboards , as Intel has just announced a bevy of new 300-series chipsets . Thus far every motherboard has featured the premium Z370 chipset , but now those will be joined by boards featuring the more price-conscious H370 and B360 chipsets . Thankfully , even the lowest-end consumer chipset seems to be relatively well-equipped , with support for 12 PCIe 3.0 lanes , 4 USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 ports , Intel Optane memory and integrated Intel AC Wi-Fi .

Intel has finally crammed its Optane technology into a traditional memory stick form , albeit with the initial offering unsurprisingly aimed at heavyweight rather than consumer usage – but this points the way to promising things to come . Intel first announced 3D Xpoint tech , which Optane is built on , almost three years ago now , although thus far Optane products have only been available as SSDs ( or cache modules to speed up traditional spinning drives ) . This major move sees Optane transitioning to a standard stick of memory which can be slotted into your motherboard just like a plain old DDR4 RAM module . The result is called Optane DC persistent memory . What Intel is shooting for here is an attempt to get the best of both worlds when it comes to system memory and traditional drive storage . Optane DC persistent memory will offer far better performance than an Optane SSD , and although it won ’ t be as quick as DRAM , it will boast seriously elevated prospects in terms of capacity . Intel also claims it will be more cost-effective than traditional memory . And unlike traditional system RAM , Optane DC persistent memory , as the ‘ persistent ’ part of the name suggests , won ’ t lose the data stored on it when the host machine is powered down ; so it acts like a drive in that respect . Intel noted : “ By expanding affordable system memory capacities ( greater than 3 terabytes per CPU socket ) , end customers can use systems enabled with this new class of memory to better optimize their workloads by moving and maintaining larger amounts of data closer to the processor and minimizing the higher latency of fetching data from system storage . ” So , we are looking at huge potential capacities , with Intel making the persistent memory available in capacities of up to 512GB per stick ( yes , 512GB ) to begin with . The company said it ’ s already sampling now , with shipping to select customers beginning later this year , and Optane DC persistent memory expected to be widely available next year . The new memory is designed to work with Intel ’ s next-gen Xeon processors in data centers , where it is expected to have a “ significant impact on real-world operations ” . That means a 9.4 times increase in database operations per second , Intel claims , and the ability for servers using the new memory to host more instances , as well as benefiting from restart times in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes for a DRAM-only cold restart . The benefits are pretty clear , then . And hopefully , as mentioned at the outset , this points the way to some Optane advancements for the consumer on the memory front down the line . Thus far , Optane has been available to the consumer user in the form of memory modules that act as a cache for a slower hard drive , and high-performance SSDs of various different flavors . While those storage applications are certainly impressive , the memory arena is where Optane is likely to make its greatest impact . Via Techspot

Last month , a rumor emerged that Intel was preparing a special anniversary edition Core i7-8086K processor – to mark the 40th birthday of the release of the first 8086 chip on June 8 , 1978 – and now multiple retailer listings for the CPU are being spotted . As Videocardz reports , the niftily-named Core i7-8086K has been listed by Italian , Canadian and US retailers amongst others , and according to these product listings , the price is set to be about €480 or $ 480 ( around £360 , AU $ 640 ) . That ’ s about $ 70 ( around £50 , AU $ 95 ) more than Intel ’ s Core i7-8700K . Of course , we have to take that pricing with a shovelful of salt , and indeed the existence of this Core i7-8086K is still unconfirmed , of course . At least one of the aforementioned product listings is still live , although the Italian retailer in question has already taken its web page down . So , this is certainly further evidence that such an anniversary edition processor does actually exist , but we can ’ t get too carried away at this point . However , fingers crossed that this becomes a reality , because the chip ’ s rumored spec based on these fresh product listings is that it is capable of boosting to 5GHz out of the box , which would make it the first Intel chip to do so ( with a purported base clock of 4GHz according to previous speculation ) . That speculation also shows the Core i7-8086K is a six-core ( 12-thread ) processor with a TDP of 95W . The good news is that we ’ ll know for sure what ’ s happening a week on Friday , as that ’ s June 8 , the anniversary date in question .

Remember the Meltdown and Spectre fixes that Intel is baking into its processors to make them bulletproof to these vulnerabilities at a silicon level , and which are expected to be incorporated into new CPUs that ship later this year ? Well , it ’ s allegedly the case that those countermeasures won ’ t defend these chips against a new freshly-discovered Spectre flaw . Earlier this week came the official revelation that there is a fresh strain of Spectre – Variant 4 , known as Speculative Store Bypass – which leverages similar vulnerabilities to the existing variants , although Intel noted it uses a different method to crack into the sensitive data held in your computer ’ s memory . Read more : HP Spectre Folio And , according to sources who spoke to Threatpost , the aforementioned safeguards which Intel is implementing may protect against Spectre Variants 2 and 3 , but not this fourth incarnation . There may also be further spins along these sort of speculative execution side channel vulnerabilities in the future , the sources further noted ( which is precisely why Microsoft , for one , recently kicked off a major bug bounty program with big rewards for those who flag up these issues ) . At any rate , Intel isn ’ t leaving processors undefended against Variant 4 , of course , even if it does turn out to be the case that the new integrated silicon-level countermeasures aren ’ t able to protect against V4 . Check out our comprehensive guide on how to protect yourself from Spectre and Meltdown . As the chip manufacturer said earlier this week , the new bug is ‘ medium risk ’ , and it has “ already delivered the microcode update for Variant 4 in beta form to OEM system manufacturers and system software vendors , and we expect it will be released into production BIOS and software updates over the coming weeks . ” The issue with this fix is , unlike baked-in protection , there ’ s a performance price to pay , just like previous Meltdown and Spectre patches . Intel estimates that to be a slowdown of around 2 % to 8 % based on SYSmark and other benchmarks , but of course mileage will doubtless vary from system to system . As has been the case in the past , as well , you may see more of a detrimental effect if you ’ re running an older version of Windows ( i.e . pre-Windows 10 ) . Interestingly , Intel will be delivering this Variant 4 fix as an optional measure , and it will actually be set to off by default . That means users will need to enable protection if they so wish , or carry on regardless and avoid any performance hit , with the potential risk of being exploited down the line .
Earlier this week , we reported that Intel ’ s rumored first octa-core processor appeared with a 2.6GHz base frequency , but this forthcoming Coffee Lake-S chip might be faster after all . Intel 's eight-core CPU appeared again in the SiSoft Sandra database running at a significantly faster 3.1GHz and the processor will likely be officially announced with even faster speeds . That ’ s based on just the fact that these are purported preliminary engineering samples , we can expect higher clock speeds as Intel moves towards qualification and test samples . Read more : Intel Core i9-9900K In a bit of related news , PCGamesHardware claims to have spotted official documentation from Intel regarding the oft rumored and accidentally leaked Z390 chipset . The allegedly official documents show the forthcoming chipset will lend at least nine PCIe lanes towards USB 3.1 Gen2 ports , however , the total number of available PCIe lanes remains unchanged from Z370 ’ s maximum of 24 . With all these Coffee Lake-S and Z390 rumors coming so fast and furiously , it almost seems certain we ’ ll see both a new chip and platform officially announced at Computex 2018 . Via PCGamesN

Microsoft has deployed another cumulative update for the big Windows 10 April 2018 Update , and among the batch of fixes is a cure for the issue that was causing major problems with SSDs from Intel and Toshiba . Update KB4100403 patches the build number of the OS up to 17134.81 , and contains fixes for issues in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge , along with the solution for a Windows Hello bug , as well as the SSD fix . On the latter , Microsoft noted that the patch “ addresses an issue with power regression on systems with NVMe devices from certain vendors ” . Windows Update should pick this up for you automatically if you ’ re already running the April 2018 Update , but those with Intel and Toshiba SSDs will have been blocked from upgrading because of the aforementioned gremlins . Microsoft advises users with these solid-state drives to wait until the April 2018 Update is offered to their PC , rather than rushing off and installing it manually now , because the KB4100403 patch isn ’ t incorporated into the big update just yet . Obviously , when it is included , the update will then be unblocked and rolled out for those using the affected drives . However , if you ’ re impatient and don ’ t want to wait for Microsoft to push the update to your machine , the firm advises that : “ Starting May 25 , if you ’ re an advanced user on an actively serviced version of Windows 10 and would like to install Windows 10 version 1803 , you can manually check for updates . ” In other words , for those manually upgrading to the April 2018 Update , the SSD fix will be incorporated starting from tomorrow . So just make sure you don ’ t jump the gun ... At any rate , whichever route you choose , you ’ ll soon be able to enjoy the Windows 10 April 2018 Update and all its goodies . As a final note , if you ’ ve come across any other issues with the April 2018 Update , we ’ ve got an extensive guide on how to troubleshoot problems . Via Neowin

Intel ’ s mystery octa-core Coffee Lake-S chip has re-emerged yet again and this time , there are more details than ever . The rumored processor was spotted among the sea of CPUs in the Sisoftware datebase , appearing as an 8-core and 16-thread processor that seems designed specifically to put an end to Ryzen 2nd generation ’ s core-count advantage . What ’ s more , according to the documentation , it seems as though the processor is tuned to run at a 2.6GHz base frequency , though , there ’ s no mention of this chip ’ s boost clock potential . Interestingly , Sisoftware lists that the processor was used with an ‘ Intel Kaby Lake client platform , ’ meaning Coffee Lake-S could potentially work with last generation 200-series motherboards . This would be a startling surprise . When Intel made the jump from Kaby Lake to Coffee Lake , it claimed that all processors would require a new chipset . However , not too long ago , some clever modders managed to get Coffee Lake processors to work with older motherboards . We highly doubt that Intel would double back to an older chipset , but it would lower a massive barrier of entry for Kaby Lake users to upgrade their processors . Via Wccftech

Intel ’ s 10 nanometer Cannon Lake processors may not see the light of day before 2019 , but that hasn ’ t stopped the firm from stoking the flames of anticipation . The company has officially posted details of just one of its Cannon Lake CPUs for laptops : the Intel Core i3-8121U . This is the very same 10nm processor that was leaked just days ago through a Chinese retailer , and Intel ’ s official specifications line up with details posted on that website almost exactly . For starters , the posting confirms the 2.2GHz base clock speed and promises a 3.2GHz boost speed as per the retailer . Altogether this seems like a fast clock speed for an i3 processor , which Intel has confirmed to be dual-core with four threads . Further details on the processor include a rather light thermal design power , or TDP , of 15W , which should leave plenty of headroom for other parts as well as generally longer battery life . Even more to this apparent goal of battery life gains are the two new types of memory , or RAM , supported by this processor : up to 32GB of LPDDR4 and LPDDR4X . Both of these new kinds of RAM are designed for low-power applications , meaning a smaller contribution to TDP and therefore less overall power drawn from a battery . However , what ’ s awfully odd about this processor spec sheet is the complete lack of a graphics core , or GPU . Almost every other mobile Intel processor comes with Intel HD Graphics of some level . The laptop that the processor was first found within , the Lenovo IdeaPad 330 , is listed to include a discrete AMD graphics chip , which is great because otherwise it ’ d be a laptop with nothing to see . Is this a chip expressly designed for affordable gaming or multimedia use ? With just a spec sheet to go off , it ’ s tough to say what Intel ’ s intent is with this mobile processor , but at least Cannon Lake is now a little less mysterious before its 2019 arrival .

Intel next Z390 chipset has been rumored and leaked for some time now , but the upcoming platform was official for a hot minute this week . Intel briefly posted the Z390 chipset specifications on its official site detailing that the new platform will support onboard Wireless-AC 802.11ac , Bluetooth 5 and USB 3.1 Gen 2 – all features not found on the current Z370 chipset . Other than that , though , there seem to be no changes to the number of available PCIe lanes or memory support . Read more : Intel Core i9-9980XE Sadly , the documentation doesn ’ t say what processor socket it will support , but in the past rumors have suggested that the new Z390 motherboards will support both existing Coffee Lake and future Cannon Lake CPUs . Intel ’ s description of the Z390 chipset features seems to put overclocking in focus with support for Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 and Intel Hyper-Threading Technology . Once again though , these are feature we ’ ve already seen on Intel ’ s current Coffee Lake platforms . Via Notebook Check
Intel itself said that we won ’ t see 10-nanometer Cannon Lake processors until 2019 , but appears the first laptop sporting the company ’ s next generation processors has just leaked . Computer Base was the first to spot a new 15-inch Lenovo IdeaPad 330 rocking a new Intel Core i3-8121U processor on the Chinese online retailer , JD . According to the online listing the CPU is based on Intel ’ s forthcoming 10nm Cannon Lake architecture and is equipped with two-cores as well as four-threads . It seems the online retailer also lists the laptop chip will run at a base 2.2GHz and up to 3.2GHz with Turbo Boost . JD also lists the laptop will sell for 3,299 Chinese yen , which converts to about $ 450 ( about £330 , AU $ 600 ) . Although it seems like this Lenovo IdeaPad 330 will be a budget system it apparently features DDR4 RAM , so perhaps Cannon Lake will finally leave the aging DDR3 class of RAM behind . There ’ s no mention of a release date on the site , but the fact that retailer listing for a Cannon Lake-powered laptop lends credence to their eventual release . However , this is China after all , and retailers there are notorious for creating fakes or embellishing their wares , so we ’ re still going to take this news with a grain of salt . Via Hexus

Windows 10 ’ s latest major update has seen a number of bugbears strike , and the latest appears to be a show-stopping problem for owners of certain Intel SSDs . Apparently , there ’ s a compatibility issue with Intel SSD 600p Series and Pro 6000p Series NVMe drives , whereby users installing the Windows 10 April 2018 Update could experience a crash , with their PC rebooting to a UEFI screen . Nasty . Read more : Teclast F7 Plus laptop Microsoft further explains that there is a known incompatibility problem with these SSDs and the update may cause “ performance and stability issues ” , and that as a result , it ’ s currently working with Intel and hardware manufacturers to block the April 2018 Update from machines running these drives . So there will be a temporary block in place , and once the software giant has implemented a fix , the update will be made available for PCs with these SSDs once again . As the Register reports , for the moment , if you have one of these Intel drives and have been hit by this problem , Microsoft ’ s advice is to simply take a step back and reinstall the previous update ( Fall Creators Update ) . If you ’ re stuck , there ’ s further help provided by the company on how to do that right here . Also , if you ’ ve encountered any other issues with the April 2018 Update , we ’ ve got an extensive guide on how to troubleshoot problems . Other issues encountered by folks moving to the update include a glitch where Google ’ s Chrome browser is locking up , problems with some Alienware laptops ( which have also been blocked from installing the update for now ) , and a rogue patch that actually seems to cause a ‘ black screen of death ’ , which is another particularly nasty one . With sprawling updates as complicated as the ones Microsoft pushes out for Windows 10 on a twice yearly basis , there are always going to be niggles of one sort or another . We just have to hope that they ’ re only minor bugs , although as we ’ ve seen this time round , that isn ’ t always the case .

Intel has been rumored to be working on a discrete graphics card for some time now , and we may well see it announced at CES 2019 . At least that ’ s according to Anthony Garreffa of TweakTown , who says that , according to industry sources , Intel ’ s GPU team has “ reached the end of this first step , and are now preparing for the big [ GPU ] launch . ” Read more : HP EliteBook 745 G5 Intel recently poached the Athlon and Ryzen CPU architect Jim Keller from Telsa , and is now said to be pushing ahead with the next-generation Intel graphics core . Previously , Intel snapped up AMD ’ s Radeon Tech Group Leader , Raja Koduri , and Global Product Marketing , Chris Hook . On top of this , we previously reported that Intel is building a graphics-focused team of at least 102 personnel . With all of that in mind it seems certain that Intel is working on something big in the GPU world . Of course , we ’ ll have to take this latest rumor with a grain of salt , especially after a previous Tweaktown report claimed that Nvidia would launch a new GPU in late March at the company GPU Technology Conference – obviously , that didn ’ t happen .

Intel is on a roll with introducing new Optane storage solutions and now the company has announced its fastest drive yet . Meet the new Optane SSD 905P . It features the highest random read rated at 575,000 IOPS and random write rated at 555,000 IOPs we ’ ve ever seen . Its 2,600MB/s sequential read and 2,200MB/s sequential write speeds might seem pedestrian compared to the Samsung 970 Evo and WD Black NVMe SSDs we tested last week , but make no mistake , this is a fast solid-state drive . The Optane SSD 905P , builds upon the already incredibly fast performance we saw out of the last generation Intel Optane 900P . Compared to it 's predecessor , the Optane 905P hits 25,000 IOPs higher in random reads and 50,000 greater IOPs in random write . Plus the 905P series also comes in larger capacities of up to 960GB , double that of the largest 480GB Intel Optane 900P . As with its predecessor , the Intel Optane 905P drives come in two variants : a PCie expansion card ( that now features built-in RGB lighting ) and a more traditional 2.5-inch model . The earlier only comes in an 960GB capacity for $ 1,119 ( about £825 , AU $ 1,490 ) while the 2.5-inch drive version rocks 480GB of storage space and costs $ 599 ( about £440 , AU $ 800 ) .
Intel has revealed it 's discontinuing its quad-core Kaby Lake-X processors , a mere 11 months after they were first announced , with the company explaining its plans for the chips ’ EOL ( end of life ) status . The Intel Kaby Lake-X Core i7-7740X and Core i5-7640X were designed for the enthusiast market , with the chips capable of some incredibly impressive overclocking performance , but it appears that the response to them was muted , with poor sales being cited as the reason for the discontinuation . Read more : Intel Core i9-9900K It didn ’ t help that the Kaby Lake-X lineup was outshone by the Skylake-X processors , as they offered fewer PCIe lanes , ‘ only ’ four cores and support for just dual channel memory . With Intel now moving to the X399 platform , it looks like it there won ’ t be support for quad-core processors using the HEDT platform . In a product change notification document made by Intel , the company states that PC makers and component resellers will need to order the processors by November 30 , 2018 , with the final shipment of Kaby Lake-X chips pencilled in for May 31 , 2019 . So , if you want to get a Kaby Lake-X processor , you have around a year left to buy them . Meanwhile , Intel has also released a new GPU driver ( 24.20.100.6025 ) to coincide with the launch of the Windows 10 April 2018 Update . This update comes with a number of improvements to image quality and power efficiency , but what ’ s perhaps most noteworthy is that this is Intel ’ s first zero-day launch-ready graphics driver release . The update includes WDDM v2.4 support for the 1803/1804 RS4 Windows 10 April 2018 Update , improved HDR support , a new task manager that displays GPU frequency and power status , Vulkan 1.1 Support , various fixes for games and a lot more . This is an important achievement for Intel , which is heavily rumoured to be building a graphics card team for discrete gaming GPUs to rival those made by AMD and Nvidia . By releasing the graphics driver for its integrated graphics on the same day as the new version of Windows , rather than one or two months after the release , as Intel used to do , it shows that Intel is readying itself on the software side to be a serious player in the discrete graphics card market . Up until now , Intel has only made integrated graphics , which are included on the same chip as its processor , unlike a discrete graphics card , which is a separate card that ’ s capable of more impressive performance . We ’ re really excited about the prospect of Intel battling with AMD and Nvidia in the GPU space , so we ’ ll be watching these developments closely .

Not long after Qualcomm teased a Windows 10 device from Samsung using its latest Snapdragon 850 chipset , a Samsung Galaxy Book that uses the operating system has been disclosed through a Russian Inspection Bureau EEC certificate . First published on June 27 , the certificate directly mentions a “ Samsung Galaxy Book Windows tablet ” and possible model numbers are listed : Samsung SM-W737 and SM-W738 and its variants : SM-W737A SM-W737N SM-W737V SM-W738N , as Dutch website LetsGoDigital reports . Read more : Samsung Galaxy Book 2 Qualcomm and Samsung announced a few weeks prior to this that a Windows device using the chip maker ’ s latest system-on-a-chip for the platform was in the works . Could this be what they were talking about ? With the Galaxy Book traditionally being a device that is primarily used as a tablet , like most Windows 10 devices that run on Snapdragon hardware , this Galaxy Book may be the tablet device that Qualcomm has been previously talking about . Alternatively , Samsung could go with an Intel CPU , as it has with some of its other Windows tablets and laptops in the past ( though likely using a Qualcomm modem for the LTE connectivity , anyway ) . Of course , the final outcome could be that Samsung delivers both options , much like the HP has done with the Envy x2 . If Samsung chooses the latter option , it better be careful so as to not confuse customers . As we all should know by now , most folks out there don ’ t know their processor from their memory , much less the brand names . At any rate , we 'll now be watching the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event in early August with bated breath . Via MSPowerUser
It looks like a German online store has let slip how much the 32-core AMD Threadripper 2990X processor will cost , with a now-deleted page listing it for €1,509 ( around $ 1,700 , £1,300 , AU $ 2,300 ) . The store in question is Cyperport , and if its price is correct , it means that AMD will once again be ruthless with its pricing compared to its competitor , Intel . While the price is still a lot for a CPU , it could only end up being around $ 700 ( £300 , AU $ 900 ) more expensive than AMD ’ s flagship Ryzen Threadripper 1950X from last year . That came with 16-cores and 32 threads , compared to the Threadripper 2990X ’ s 32-cores and 64 threads . That ’ s quite an upgrade considering the potential price difference . If the AMD Threadripper 2990X does come out at this sort of price , it will once again put pressure on Intel , which usually offers much more expensive CPUs . The AMD Threadripper 2990X would actually be cheaper than Intel ’ s 18-core Intel i9-7980XE , which costs $ 1,999 ( about £1,480 , AU $ 2,510 ) . If the price and specs are correct , the AMD Threadripper 2990X will easily outperform that chip . Intel is also working on a 28-core processor to release later this year , and while that could outperform the upcoming Threadripper thanks to higher clock speeds , it ’ s also likely to be a lot more expensive . We ’ re loving the competition between Intel and AMD lately , and it ’ s great to see that AMD is apparently sticking to its method of selling high performance processors for ( relatively ) low prices . Hopefully AMD will officially reveal the Ryzen Threadripper 2990X , including its price , soon . Via Videocardz

While it may seem as if we just got through a major Intel processor refresh ( because we did ) , the latest rumors out of WccfTech suggest that Intel ’ s 9000 series of Core processors isn ’ t far off . The outlet claims to have come across marketing materials and product names for a number of upcoming Intel processors , namely the Core i9 line of CPUs , which will join the mainstream lineup on Intel ’ s upcoming Z390 chipset for general-use and gaming PCs . This move will reportedly bring octa-core processing to the mainstream line of Intel chips for the first time , supporting a previous rumor of the 8-core Coffee Lake chip due in September . Here ’ s the line of processors the outlet claims to have found : You ’ ll immediately notice three things about this supposedly leaked lineup : first , that there is no Core i3 option listed . As the outlet points out , this could either be Intel phasing out the product from its Core line of processors , or that it will release at a later date than these chips . The second thing you may notice is that the Core i5 option has no hyperthreading . Finally , there is no quad-core part listed here , for the first time in an Intel processor lineup . That is , unless a 4-core Intel Core i3 part is waiting in the wings . WccfTech ’ s findings continue to claim that the Z390 chipset is not that far advanced beyond the existing Z370 chipset that launched late last year to support the first Coffee Lake desktop processors . However , they will bring features introduced to the latest H-series entry-level platform earlier this year . Those features include Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi , Bluetooth 5.0 , a native Intel Wi-Fi adapter and support for up to six USB 3.1 ( Gen 2 ) ports . Currently , motherboard makers must source those arguably crucial features from third-party suppliers to include them on Z370 motherboards . If you ’ re already mourning the loss of quad-core Intel chips for whatever reason , you might want to hold fire . It ’ s more likely that quad-core will find its way into even lower-powered processors over time , if not found within a Core i3 option yet to be uncovered . Simply put , Intel would be throwing away money if it neglected to find some application for quad-core processing . At any rate , all of this should be considered rumor ( albeit from an outlet with a strong track record ) until word is heard from Intel itself – or even more irrefutable leaks show themselves .

Intel ’ s rumored octa-core processor has been benchmarked again and curiously the results were blurred out in the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990X test results we reported on earlier this week . Komachi tweeted an undoctored version of the screenshot to reveal an Intel 8-core Coffee Lake-S processor achieving a Cinebench score of 2,212 points . Read more : Intel Core i9-9900K AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990X處理器效能曝光 暴力多核更上層樓 https : //t.co/T1dHVHcZ8V pic.twitter.com/KhiG9TBgBwJune 20 , 2018 Comparatively , AMD ’ s latest Ryzen 7 2700X achieved a Cinebench score of 1,798 points . If Intel intends to add more cores to close the gap with Ryzen 2nd Generation ’ s incredible multi-core performance , it seems this Coffee Lake-S will achieve that goal . The brief specs listed in the Cinebench screenshot also details that the Intel ’ s mystery octa-core chip features 16-threads and 3.1GHz clock speed — which we hope is the CPU ’ s base frequency . Although this info dump looks tantalizing , we ’ re not going to put much stock into it . The screenshot could have easily been photoshopped to include any processor of our dreams . So , we ’ ll wait for Intel ’ s official announcement of such a CPU before we start celebrating . Via Wccftech
Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has resigned from the company over allegations he had a relationship with a fellow employee . The computing giant confirmed that Kraznich , who has been chief executive since May 2013 , has left the company with immediate effect due to breaking Intel 's non-fraternisation policy . Mr Krzanich , who has been credited with transforming Intel from a purely hardware-focused company into a multi-faceted computing organisation , had been married to wife Brandee , and was reportedly paid over $ 21 million last year . “ Intel was recently informed that Mr Krzanich had a past consensual relationship with an Intel employee , ” the company said in a statement . “ An ongoing investigation by internal and external counsel has confirmed a violation of Intel ’ s non-fraternisation policy , which applies to all managers . Given the expectation that all employees will respect Intel ’ s values and adhere to the company ’ s code of conduct , the Board has accepted Mr Krzanich ’ s resignation . ” Finance head Robert Swan has been named interim Intel CEO , with the news coming shortly before the company was set to release its second quarter results . In a guidance alert issued today , Intel raised its expectations for the quarter , predicting earnings of 99 cents a share , equivalent to $ 16.9bn in revenue .

Remember Intel ’ s recent competition giving punters the chance to win one of its Core i7-8086K limited-edition processors celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first 8086 chip ? Well , in what could be described as a cheeky move – although Intel might use a stronger term – AMD is offering 40 folks in the US who scoop one of Intel 's CPUs the chance to swap it for a Threadripper 1950X . The Core i7-8086K is a 6-core ( 12-thread ) processor that 's capable of boosting to 5GHz out of the box , the latter being the big selling point . However , AMD ’ s Threadripper 1950X is a 16-core ( 32-thread ) monster which can boost to 4GHz , and retails at around $ 750 in the US these days ( £670 in the UK , which is around AU $ 1,200 ) , compared to Intel ’ s chip , which will set you back around $ 430 ( £380 in the UK , around AU $ 680 ) . Read more : HP EliteBook 745 G5 So yes , AMD is firmly treading on Intel ’ s toes here , with the move to offer winners a swap to a beefier and more expensive chip , rather than , say , launching a competition of its own . It ’ s what you might call disruptive marketing ( although again , Intel would probably use a stronger term ) . That said , while AMD ’ s processor may bristle with a much greater core count compared to the anniversary edition CPU from Intel , the latter is still clocked considerably faster , and , depending on what you ’ re doing , could achieve a better level of performance – despite the gulf in cost . The other consideration is that Intel ’ s chip is a limited-edition affair celebrating the big 8086 anniversary , so it could be worth something in that respect in the future . As we mentioned at the outset , this offer is only available to Intel ’ s competition winners in the US . And you ’ ll need to follow certain steps detailed at AMD ’ s web page here to facilitate the swap . AMD explains : “ Notified winners of [ Intel ’ s ] Competitor Sweepstakes , subject to Terms and Conditions , may be able to exchange their prizes for a Ryzen Threadripper 1950X processor . “ The first 40 eligible persons who complete the steps that will be communicated on this page on June 25 will be offered the ability to exchange their new , in-box Competitor Sweepstakes prize processor for a flagship 16-core AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X processor . ” So just be aware that it ’ s the first 40 people who get in touch and complete the necessary steps that will qualify for the swap , and also that your Intel prize must still be unopened in its box . AMD is certainly taking the opportunity to leverage everything that comes to hand against its main rivals , Intel and Nvidia . In terms of the latter , most recently that meant firing numerous volleys of flak at the rival graphics card manufacturer over its GeForce Partner Program – an endeavor that Nvidia eventually abandoned due to the negative publicity surrounding it .

Samsung has revealed a second-generation of its Chromebook Plus convertible , with the new spin on the 2-in-1 laptop getting beefed up with an Intel processor . The original Samsung Chromebook Plus ran with an ARM-based hexa-core CPU , whereas the new model goes with an Intel processor – just like its Chromebook Pro sibling – albeit not a Core family CPU , but a Celeron 3965Y . That ’ s a dual-core chip which runs at 1.5GHz with a TDP of 6W , and has considerably more grunt than its predecessor ’ s ARM effort . Samsung ’ s Chromebook Plus ( V2 ) makes another useful change by doubling up on the cameras , offering both front and rear-facing models . The front-facer is a 1-megapixel ( MP ) affair , with the rear camera boasting 13MP and benefiting from auto-focus . There are more connectors on board , as well , with a pair of USB-C ports ( capable of outputting 4K to an external display with an optional adapter ) , along with a USB 3.0 connector and a microSD card slot . As before , there ’ s a built-in stylus . The system memory and storage remain the same at 4GB and 32GB , respectively , although interestingly the 12.2-inch display is now a more conventional 1,920 x 1,080 ( Full HD ) resolution , as opposed to 2,400 x 1,600 ( a 3:2 aspect ratio ) on the original Chromebook Plus . So it ’ s not such a sharp screen , but then again , that will also help improve performance alongside the more powerful processor , because there are fewer pixels to shift . The notebook is 16mm at its thinnest and weighs 1.33kg , with a 39Wh battery as before . It also benefits from a curved-cap keyboard that promises to be able to deal with small liquid spillages of up to 60cc . The Chromebook Plus ( V2 ) will go on sale at Best Buy ’ s online and brick-and-mortar stores over in the US come June 24 , with the price starting at $ 499 ( around £375 , AU $ 665 ) – $ 50 more than the first-gen model went on sale for originally .
Like clockwork , Intel has allegedly once again made an official listing for a rumored series of next generation processors . Just yesterday we covered the potential of Intel ’ s first Cascade Lake series processors and shortly after Wccftech spotted a listing on Intel ’ s website for the very same chips . According to the listing – which has been taking down as of this writing – the upcoming Cascade Lake series falls under the Xeon server family , splitting into two Scalable and Advanced Processors meant for the High-Performance Computing and datacenter markets . Despite the seemingly enterprise-focus of the Cascade Lake series CPUs , the Scalable Processor version will supposedly be compatible with the LGA 3647 socket , which opens up the possibility of a consumer facing Cascade Lake-X high-end desktop ( HEDT ) parts in the future . That said , we ’ ll likely see Intel upcoming Skylake-X or Kaby Lake-X processors enter the HEDT market first . Intel officially announced a 28-core processor at Computex 2018 , followed quickly by rumors of a 22-core CPU .
A new security vulnerability has been found in Intel ’ s family of Core processors , along similar lines of the major Spectre bug that has been making headlines all year . Thankfully , this one appears to be less severe – and is already patched in modern versions of Windows and Linux . The freshly-discovered hole is known as the ‘ Lazy FP state restore ’ bug , and like Spectre , it is a speculative execution side channel attack . Just a few weeks back , we were told to expect further spins on speculative execution attack vectors , and it seems this is one . Read more : HP Spectre Folio Intel explains : “ Systems using Intel Core-based microprocessors may potentially allow a local process to infer data utilizing Lazy FP state restore from another process through a speculative execution side channel . ” What that means is theoretically the flaw can be exploited to pilfer data from running applications , and worryingly , that potentially includes encryption operations , as ZDNet reports . All Intel Core chips are vulnerable regardless of the platform they ’ re running on . The good news is that severity of this attack is only rated as ‘ moderate ’ by Intel , as it ’ s tricky to exploit , and also easy to fix . Indeed , modern versions of both Windows and Linux – that includes Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 , and any Linux distro which employs the Linux 4.9 kernel or better – are believed to be safe from this vulnerability already . OpenBSD and DragonflyBSD are also bulletproof , plus a fix has already been issued for FreeBSD . Windows 2008 Server users , however , will need to install a patch to protect themselves . And despite this not being rated as a critical vulnerability , you ’ ll certainly want to get things patched as soon as possible . As we ’ ve already mentioned , there are likely to be more of these speculative execution side channel attacks discovered , and 2018 is set to be a lively year on the security front , to say the least .

Intel ’ s first mainstream octa-core processor is due to arrive in a few months , according to the latest rumors . A PCWatch report claims to have launch schedule details on Intel ’ s next three desktop processor families . Supposedly , we will see Intel ’ s 8-core Coffee Lake Refresh – as opposed to the Coffee Lake-S moniker we ’ ve seen thus far – processor as an extension of the existing Coffee Lake family of processors this September to help close the gap between itself and AMD Ryzen 2nd Generation . Read more : HP EliteBook 745 G5 What the report doesn ’ t mention is whether these Coffee Lake Refresh CPUs will launch with Intel ’ s oft-rumored Z390 motherboard . If the rumors are true , this would put yet another damper on the possibility of seeing Intel Cannon Lake processors anytime soon . The PCWatch report also alludes to the possibility of a new high-end desktop processor with up to 22-cores also launching this September . That would be an extra four-cores over the current top-end consumer processor from Intel , the Core i9-7980XE , which features 18 cores and 36 threads . PCWatch refers to the chip as being either a part of the Skylake-X or Kaby Lake-X family , but it ’ s sure the CPU will socket into a new LGA2066 Basin Fall platform – so , it seems upgrading to Intel ’ s next high-end desktop ( HEDT ) processor will require buying a new motherboard . Intel publicly announced its plans for a 28-core processor that operates at 5GHz , so we at least know its certain that the company is looking to replace or expanding its current Skylake X family . Lastly , the PCWatch report makes a small mention of a completely new Cascade Lake-X family of processors said to launch in the second half of 2019 . Supposedly , these new CPUs will target the ultra-premium HEDT niche . Via Wccftech
Intel has announced that it will be releasing its first discrete graphics card in 2020 , with the new GPU aimed at data center and gaming PCs . This is exciting news , as the graphics card market has so far been dominated by just two players : Nvidia and AMD . With Intel creating its own line of GPUs , gamers should have more choice when it comes to buying the best graphics card for their rigs . Intel confirmed that its first discrete GPU will be arriving in 2020 via Twitter . Frustratingly , the tweet appears to link to an incorrect webpage , so we don ’ t have too much information to go on . However , rumors of Intel entering the discrete GPU market have been swirling for some time now . Intel 's first discrete GPU coming in 2020 : https : //t.co/s9EPeFifBp pic.twitter.com/n5zmUY2Mc2June 12 , 2018 Intel has experience with graphics processing units ( GPUs ) , as its processors ship with integrated GPUs . This means the GPU is on the same chip as the processor , enabling users to operate their PCs , and even play games , without the need for a separate graphics card . Producing discrete GPUs means Intel can put even more power into the graphics cards it creates , and the idea of a three-way race between Intel , AMD and Nvidia to woo gamers is certainly an exciting prospect . While 2020 still feels a long way off , it ’ s actually pretty soon in the world of GPU development , so it appears that Intel is taking its entry into discrete GPUs seriously . There are also rumors that we ’ ll see Intel ’ s new graphics card next year , at CES 2019 . With a new challenger entering the ring , AMD and Nvidia will need to work even harder to ensure their GPUs remain appealing to customers . Things are about to get very interesting indeed… Via PC World

In case you missed the Intel Core i7-8068K giveaway , the processor is officially on sale now . We ’ ve seen the processor available for $ 425 ( £379 , AU $ 629 ) on a number of retail sites around the world including Amazon , Newegg , Overclockers and Scan , as well as MWave . That price is about $ 75 ( £60 , AU $ 130 ) more than the Intel Core i7-8700K ’ s current retail price of $ 349 ( about £320 , AU $ 500 ) . The premium on this chip is down to it being 300MHz faster overall than Intel ’ s current flagship processor . It ’ s also the first CPU with a factory-set 5GHz Turbo clock , and we ’ ve already seen some crazy liquid-nitrogen overclocking that takes the processor well past that . Of course , this being a limited-edition run you 'll need to act fast to pick up this 40th anniversary special chip – current rumors suggest Intel will only produce a total of 50,000 processors to be sold around the world .

Intel only just revealed its beefy Core i7-8086K back at the start of the week at Computex 2018 , yet the anniversary edition processor has already been overclocked by an expert to hit a speed of 7.24GHz across all six of its cores . This was achieved by Der8auer ( a big name in the world of overclocking ) over at Computex , using the usual liquid nitrogen cooling method ( chilling the chip to negative 185 degrees Celsius ) to prevent the CPU from overheating or melting into an unidentifiable lump of silicon . Der8auer shows the process in a YouTube video ( below ) where he explained that he more or less used the same presets as when previously overclocking Intel ’ s 8700K , and that the new 8086K anniversary chip is essentially a “ good pretest 8700K ” . As Windows Latest reports , he professed the belief that he could break the record he previously set with a 7.3GHz overclock on the 8700K . Obviously 7.24GHz is pretty close to that anyway as a starting point for a first attempt , and what you have to bear in mind is that there was a far more limited selection of processors available in this case . Part of getting a record overclock is about finding a top-performing chip , as they all have slight variances ( whether you get a good one with higher tolerances for overclocking is referred to as the ‘ silicon lottery ’ ) , and Der8auer had a much bigger selection of 8700K CPUs to work with when he clocked up 7.3GHz . So the expectation certainly seems to be that this record will fall when he gets a proper run at overclocking the 8086K with a larger selection of chips . Part of the attraction of the Core i7-8086K is that it can hit 5GHz ( via turbo ) out of the box without any overclocking at all , and whether using liquid nitrogen or straightforward air cooling , this chip should be impressive when it comes to juicing it up . If you fancy chancing your arm in a competition to win one of the new 8086K chips , Intel ’ s sweepstakes is still open at the time of writing , and will be for the remainder of the day in the UK ( or until 5pm PT in the US , which is 8pm ET ) . All you have to do is provide your email address to enter .
Intel certainly impressed us at Computex 2018 when it showed off a new processor that features an incredible 28 cores clocked at 5GHz – and now we ’ ve seen more details about this monster CPU . The vast majority of processors that most people use in their PCs feature four cores , so we always expected this 28-core CPU to be something that ’ s not aimed at the mainstream , but having seen some of the details – including a possible price – we ’ re now convinced that this CPU will be out of the reach of pretty much everyone . As Anandtech reports , the cooling system alone is suitably crazy . With so many cores running at such a high clock rate , it needs a beefy cooling solution to make sure it doesn ’ t overheat , and the demo machine on show was being cooled by a large water chiller that runs refrigerant into the machine . This cooler , a Hailea HC-1000B , requires 1,000W of power on its own , and pumps 1,500 to 4,000 liters of liquid that ’ s been chilled to 4C . Intel also confirmed to Anandtech that the CPU was overclocked at well ( something that wasn ’ t mentioned when the CPU was revealed on stage ) . The CPU was using a 1600W Corsair power supply unit , which costs around $ 500 ( £370 , AU $ 660 ) , so you can already imagine that this is n't going to be an affordable setup , especially if you include running costs . Intel has said that it 's working with both Asus and Gigabyte to create motherboards for the 28-core CPU , and according to Anandtech it was a Gigabyte motherboard the demo system was running on . Intel also confirmed that the 28-core processor is built on a 14nm node ( rather than a 10nm one ) , which suggests it 's based on Intel ’ s Skylake-X processors , like the 28-core Xeon Platinum 8176 , rather than the upcoming Cascade Lake platform . Here ’ s the biggie . It was never going to be a cheap CPU ( Intel ’ s Core i9-7980XE 18-core CPU costs $ 1,999 ( about £1,480 , AU $ 2,510 ) , but with speculation that it ’ s based on an Intel Xeon Platinum 8180 , it ’ s unlikely that it will cost less than $ 10,000 ( around £8,000 , AU $ 13,000 ) . Combined with the price of the motherboard and cooling system , Anandtech is touting a $ 100,000 cost for the whole system . That puts it firmly in enterprise territory , so don ’ t go expecting to see any 28-core consumer PCs any time soon .

Earlier this week at Computex , Intel revealed its Core i7-8086K – so named because it celebrates the 40th anniversary of the first 8086 chip – and the company is kicking off a sweepstake today that gives you a chance to win one of these limited edition processors that boost to 5GHz out-of-the-box . The competition goes live at 5pm PT in the US ( that ’ s 8pm ET , or 1am BST in the morning , so technically tomorrow in the UK ) , and runs for 24 hours . All you have to do is head to this website and register your entry . There are plenty of CPUs up for grabs , with the company giving away 8,086 of the chips , no less . There will likely be a lot of entries , though… Only those in the US , UK and Canada ( excluding Quebec ) can enter , along with the following European and Asian countries : France , Germany , South Korea , Japan , China and Taiwan . There are certain amounts of processors allocated to the various different regions , with some 2,086 CPUs up for grabs in the US , and 500 in the UK . You ’ ll need to provide your email address , which Intel will use to notify winners no later than two weeks from the end of the competition . Delivery of the CPU could take up to two months depending on where you live , but if you bag one , you aren ’ t likely to be moaning about the wait . The i7-8086K is a six-core ( 12-thread ) processor with a base clock speed of 4GHz , and as mentioned it hits 5GHz turbo out-of-the-box , before any overclocking has been applied .

Intel has made plenty of revelations over at Computex 2018 – including several seriously beefy new processors – but not everything is about performance , and on the power efficiency front , the company also made a big statement , promising laptops with a battery life of up to 28 hours . It ’ s certainly a bold claim , but Intel reckons that its collaboratively engineered Low Power Display Technology , featured in a 1W panel which is produced by Sharp and Innolux , can literally cut LCD power consumption levels in half . So that would , unsurprisingly , drive some major battery efficiency increases for notebooks , as the display is the one component which drains the most power in a laptop . All that said , there are a number of caveats here . Firstly , the tech will only work with Intel ’ s GPUs , so those with laptops that utilize Nvidia or AMD solutions wouldn ’ t benefit . And the claim of up to 28 hours battery life ( of local video playback ) is an estimate at this point , and the tech isn ’ t quite there at the moment , as Intel notes that it expects to eventually reach this level through ‘ continued innovation ’ with its partners . Also , that estimate is based on using ‘ several power saving techniques ’ which aren ’ t specified , while the screen brightness is set at 150 nits ( i.e . not very bright ) and the speakers not being used ( listening via headphones instead ) . So yes , there are a number of disclaimers here , but even so , this is certainly a very promising sounding development for notebooks and the quest for all-day battery life ( or indeed better than all-day ) . We ’ ll only be able to see if the reality matches Intel ’ s projected levels of longevity once we get a laptop in for testing which benefits from this new screen technology . Fingers crossed that won ’ t be too far off in the future . Via The Verge

US telecoms giant Sprint has joined the race to bring 5G to the masses , announcing at Computex 2018 to start shipping Intel-powered 5G computers next year . We also heard confirmation that Acer and Asus would be utilising Intel ’ s chips in their upcoming 5G laptops , joining the ranks of Microsoft , Lenovo , Dell , and HP –- all of which are planning on bringing 5G PCs to market throughout 2019 . The race is on to be at the forefront of wireless connectivity , with 5G promising a vastly faster and more liable transfer of data across connected devices . The potential advances a 5G network could bring to both consumers and businesses are huge , with far-reaching improvements possible for IoT devices , autonomous vehicles , and a host of modern industries . But there are currently no 5G-equipped devices on the market – PCs , smartphones , or otherwise – and it will likely be several years before the new technology sees widespread implementation . Even phone provider Huawei , which is looking to release a 5G handset in late 2019 , has tried to talk down the ballooning expectations for the technology . The hype for 5G could easily overtake its reality in the near future , but either way we ’ ll start experiencing its capabilities very soon .
You may have seen the Intel has just revealed its Core i7-8086K anniversary processor that ’ s capable of boosting to 5GHz out of the box , but the company has a bigger CPU gun up its sleeve : a 28-core processor that reaches the same clock speed . Yes , Intel is readying a single socket processor bristling with 28-cores and apparently running at 5GHz across all transistors . With nearly 30-cores , it would certainly dwarf the six cores of the aforementioned 8086K . Intel revealed this CPU with a demo at Computex , and Anandtech reports that a system powered by the processor hit a score of 7,334 in the Cinebench R15 benchmark . The chip giant also announced that this monster CPU would be out in the final quarter of this year , so this isn ’ t something for way down the line . No further details were given at this point , so it ’ s unclear exactly where this model will sit in Intel ’ s range , or what socket it will use . Technically , Intel does already produce 28-core CPUs , in the form of the top-end Intel Xeon Scalable Processors aimed at heavyweight server usage . But those chips top out at a turbo speed of 3.8GHz across their many cores , and 5GHz is quite a jump from there . So clearly , there are some question marks over how Intel will manage power consumption when balancing that blazing clock speed with the core count . And of course pricing is another matter entirely – the top Xeon Scalable offering ( Platinum 8180M ) has a recommended price of around $ 13,000 ( around £9,750 , AU $ 17,000 ) at the time of writing , in case you were wondering what a 28-core processor will cost you today . Still , this is an exciting revelation by Intel , and we are keen to hear more about exactly what form the new 28-core monster will take .
Rumors and leaks about the Intel Core i7-8086K have been all over the web , so it was almost inevitable that we would see it at Computex 2018 – and now it ’ s finally official . As previous reports suggested , the Intel Core i7-8068K is the brand ’ s most souped-up Coffee Lake desktop processor to date . Intel calls it the first ever CPU to reach a 5.0GHz turbo frequency – and that ’ s all without overclocking the chip . Otherwise the processor is outfitted with six cores and 12 threads , plus a base clockspeed of 4.0GHz . Comparatively , that ’ s 300GHz faster than the company ’ s previous Coffee Lake flagship Intel Core i7-8700K , and its TDP is still rated at the same 95W . The processor was announced as part of the run-up to Intel 's 50th anniversary on June 18 . As part of the festivities , Intel plans on giving away 8,086 Intel Core i7-8086K processors via a sweepstakes on its website . Aside from the new processor , Intel talked about the future of its product lines . On the mobile side , Intel is planning a few more new mobile entries in the Amber Lake Y-series and Whiskey Lake U-series . Supposedly , these new mobile chipsets will deliver up to `` double-digit '' improvements over the current Coffee Lake series . New X-series and next-generation S-series chips are also on the roadmap for desktops processors later this year , so we may well see Cannon Lake sooner than we thought .
We ’ ve seen our fair share of dual-screen laptops in the past , but the 15-inch Asus ZenBook Pro UX580 , unveiled at Computex 2018 , is the most well-equipped and fully thought-out implementations we ’ ve ever seen . While it ’ s not a true all-screen device , this 15-inch laptop features a 4K screen up top and a 5.5-inch screenpad just below the keyboard . Essentially users can extend their display to the second screen/touchpad hybrid , allowing them to move any open window they ’ re working in or viewing and move it to the lower monitor . All the while users a can still move the cursor around , and scroll webpages just as if they were using traditional pointing device . Watch our hands-on video with the Asus ZenBook Pro 15 and its ScreenPad below : This second screen acts more like touchpad for most of the time we used it , so we would just swipe along to move the cursor to areas we wanted to click and navigate applications . However , the second screen does include a drag-down interface you can tap on , and certain compatible applications like PowerPoint will also allow you to navigate through a simple series of taps . The Asus ZenBook Pro 15 UX580 is also packed to the gills with the latest components including up to an Intel Core i9 processor and Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti graphics . Users can also outfit their configuration with up to 16GB RAM and an 1TB PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD . The Asus ZenBook Pro 15 UX580 will be available mid-July 2018 for a starting price of $ 2,299 ( about £1,730 , AU $ 3,010 ) .

Just a few days ago , the rumored Intel Core i7-8086K Anniversary Edition processor ’ s specs were laid bare by retail leaks , and now we know when the chip will debut . Ironically , in a post defaming retail leaks about the supposed special edition chip , Overclocker ’ s Gibbo let loose that the Intel Core i7-8086K Anniversary Edition will be announced and up for preorder on June 8th . What ’ s more , Gibbo details that the chip will retail for under £400 ( about $ 530 , AU $ 705 ) , which is a far lower price than the one that leaked earlier this week . According to the latest rumors , the Core i7-8086K will be the Intel ’ s fastest 6-core consumer processor yet . Although , it features similar specs to the company ’ s current flagship Core i7-8700K including 6 cores , 12 threads and 12 MB of L3 cache , the new chip is said to be 300MHz faster overall . This increase in frequency would put its base clock speed at 4GHz with a 5GHz boost clock – and that ’ s just the speed of this supposed chip straight out of the box without factoring in overclocking potential . It ’ s almost a given that we ’ ll see the Intel Core i7-8086K Anniversary Edition processor announced at Computex 2018 , but we ’ ll hold our enthusiasm for it until it ’ s actually real .

Future Intel processor lineups have included almost a half dozen rumored codenames , but at long last we could finally have the details pinned down thanks to a leaked Intel roadmap . Xfastest posted slides of what it claims to be an official Intel roadmap outlining the processor release schedule for the coming year . Going by the schedule , and disappointingly , we shouldn ’ t expect 9th generation Intel processors until the first few months of 2019 . The Intel roadmap lists that the Core i9-9900K , Core i7-9700K and Core i5-9600K will all release in the first quarter of 2019 . Read more : Intel Core i9-9900K The slides also confirm that 9th-generation Coffee Lake Refresh processors will be compatible with Intel 300-series chipsets , so you ’ ll supposedly be able to plug any of these next-gen CPUs into something as lowly as a H310 motherboard . What will be releasing within the year are Intel ’ s next high-end desktop processors , if this purportedly official roadmap is to be believed . Interestingly , the slides refer to Intel ’ s new HEDT family as Basin Falls Refresh , rather than Skylake-X Refresh or Cascade Lake-X as has previously been rumored . The roadmap barely reveals any details , but we do see Basin Falls Refresh dominating Intel 's entire release schedule from later this year to mid-2019 . It also appears as if Basin Falls Refresh will replace every Core X and Extreme processor from the Core i5-7640X to the defunct Kaby Lake-X family to Intel ’ s highest-end consumer CPU , the Core i9-7980XE . While these slides look more authentic than previous rumors , there ’ s no way to confirm their validity . There ’ s also no date attached , so even if they are genuine , the information contained within could be outdated . Previously we heard that Intel may even announce Coffee Lake Refresh processors tomorrow ( August 1 ) , although this seems unlikely at this point . Via Segment Next
Whether it ’ s going to keep the MacBook Air moniker or amalgamate into the MacBook 12-inch line , rumors are mounting for a 2018 refresh of an affordable , lightweight notebook from Apple . The MacBook Air ’ s current model is sports a relatively archaic 5th-generation Intel processor , but reports from Taiwanese publication Economic Daily News , suggest that a new model is due later in 2018 and will use 8th-generation Kaby Lake Refresh processors . Read more : Teclast F7 Plus laptop These i5 and i7 quad-core CPUs were released late in 2017 and have base clock speeds ranging from 1.6GHz to 1.9GHz , with Turbo Boost speeds between 3.4GHz and 4.2GHz . This is obviously faster than the chipsets from 2015 , but is it enough of an upgrade ? According to Economic Daily News , Apple isn ’ t keen on waiting until 2019 for Intel ’ s Cannon Lake chips ( which use a 10nm process rather 14nm , greatly improving power , performance , and heat efficiency ) . Apparently , Apple isn ’ t even willing to wait for Intel ’ s Whiskey Lake processors either , which should be replacing the Kaby Lake Refresh line in the coming months , pointing to an impending release date for the MacBook Air successor . If this rumor is true , then the news is bittersweet – we will be seeing a MacBook Air launch sooner rather than later , but it ’ ll sport the previous generation of CPU . The MacBook Air was one of the Apple ’ s most popular releases , but the most recent model is three years old at this point , and it hasn ’ t had a design refresh since 2010 , so the growing rumors for a 2018 model would certainly be timely if true . Instead , the 12-inch notebook that Apple just calls the MacBook started to take over this space from 2015 onwards , sharing many of the same design principles by offering a more affordable and lightweight alternative to the powerful MacBook Pro , albeit with weaker specs to start with . As such , there ’ s still discussion as to whether or not the MacBook will well-and-truly replace the MacBook Air line , but no matter what form Apple ’ s latest affordable entry will take , we ’ re likely to hear more about it soon .

Asus ’ s entire Z390 motherboard lineup has leaked through a product listing document , further proof that Intel ’ s new Z390 chipset is not far off from release . The new chipset will bring the company 's high-end motherboards up to date with the recently-updated B- and H-series boards to support Intel ’ s latest , 8th-generation processors with hexa-core designs . It ’ s also expected , as Tom ’ s Hardware reports , that these motherboards will support the rumored octa-core , 8th-gen Coffee Lake S processors . According to the leak , at least 19 Asus motherboards are in the works using the new chipset , including models from the company ’ s Prime , Republic of Gamers ( ROG ) and The Ultimate Force ( TUF ) series . Some highlights of the flagship ROG lineup include six models of Asus ’ s ROG Maximus XI series of boards in standard ATX design , with options for overclocking ( Maximus XI Apex ) and water-cooling ( Maximus XI Extreme and Maximus XI Formula ) . However , there don ’ t appear to be any micro-ATX or mini-ITX models for these boards . The ROG Strix series is aimed toward more mainstream gamers , and includes the only mini-ITX board in Asus ’ s Z390 lineup . The TUF lineup , meanwhile , offers more durable connections and ports in ATX and micro-ATX formats . For mainstream users , Asus ’ s Prime series of motherboards offer ATX and micro-ATX formats with none of the extra features that many of the aforementioned boards do , like built-in Bluetooth and WiFi modules . These are ideal for those who want to add in their own wireless components . It ’ s still unclear when these motherboards will make it to market , much less Intel ’ s rumored eight-core processors that would likely launch alongside them . At any rate , this is a strong sign that a release for both isn ’ t too far off .
If you ’ re curious about how well Intel ’ s upcoming Core i9-9900K flagship 9th-generation processor will perform , then a new leaked benchmark will definitely be of interest , as it shows a very nippy CPU indeed . Bearing in mind the usual caveat of this potentially being fake – which is always a possibility with these sort of pre-launch rumors – the result from 3DMark ( as highlighted by TUM APISAK ) shows the Core i9-9900K hitting an overall score of 9,862 in the Time Spy benchmark . The chip recorded a graphics score of 9,725 and a CPU score of 10,719 . Read more : HP EliteBook 745 G5 For the benchmark , the processor was nestled in an Asus Z370-F Strix Gaming motherboard – which incidentally confirms backwards compatibility with existing Z370 boards , as previously speculated – and paired with a Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics card . The result represents an impressive turn of speed , and as Wccftech.com , which spotted this leak , points out , it beats out AMD ’ s Ryzen 7 2700X by more than 1,500 points . This leak also confirms the spec – to a large degree – and like the Ryzen 7 2700X , Intel ’ s flagship is an eight-core ( 16-thread ) processor . It also suggests that the Core i9-9900K is capable of boosting to 5GHz out of the box , although apparently that will only be across two cores ( 4.7GHz will supposedly be the maximum boost across all cores by default ) . What ’ s different with this leak is the base clock isn ’ t 3.6GHz as previously rumored , but 3.1GHz . That could throw some doubt on the validity of the benchmark for some folks , but as this early leak is likely from an engineering sample of the CPU , it ’ s not really surprising to see such a relatively low figure for the base clock . What it also underlines is that the final production chip will be even faster when it comes to benchmarking . Exciting stuff , particularly when you consider all this comes in a package with an alleged TDP of 95W ( again beating out the Ryzen 7 2700X , which weighs in at 105W ) . If all this speculation pans out , that is . We ’ re keeping our fingers firmly crossed .

Intel ’ s mysterious 9th-generation Coffee Lake Refresh processors are about to get even more perplexing , as a leak suggests the Intel Core i7-9700K will drop hyper-threading . The Intel Core i7-9700K was just listed by SiSoftware as an 8-core and 8-thread processor , making it the very first Core i7 processor without hyper-threading enabled . Online speculation suggests Intel is abandoning its signature feature in favor of reaching higher clock speeds . These specs also claim that the Intel Core i7-9700K will run at a 3.6GHz stock clock . Previously , we ’ ve heard a wealth of rumors and speculation crop up about the Core i9-9900K with its 8-core 16-thread design reaching a 4.7GHz boost clock across all cores . But this is the first time that the Core i7 part has hit the spotlight . If we look at earlier speculation about the Core i9-9900K and how it ’ ll supposedly hit a 5GHz turbo speed across two of its eight cores , dropping hyperthreading could be Intel ’ s method of hitting 5GHz across all cores . So far Intel has only been able to achieve this speed with the single-core Turbo Boost on the Intel Core i7-8086K . A 5GHz boost clock across all cores could mean that in most cases , the Core i7-9700K will perform similarly to the higher-spec Core i9-9900K . The only way we see the processor losing out in is heavy multitasking workloads , which hyper-threading provides a boost to . Like the Core i9-9900K , the Core i7-9700K will be running on the Z390 chipset , at least to start , according to rumors and official leaks . However this pans out , the 9th-generation Coffee Lake-S chips are rumored to be coming out in just a couple short months , with an announcement possibly happening as early as next month . So , we ’ re sure we ’ ll hear the final specs from Intel in the very near future . Via Wccftech

We ’ ve had some fresh leakage concerning Intel ’ s incoming 9th-generation processors ( Coffee Lake Refresh ) , including the flagship Core i9-9900K , which will apparently be capable of boosting to 5GHz . So first off , let ’ s state upfront that these CPU specs are only rumored details , so remember to treat them as such . They come from Coolaler , and they largely stack up with the speculation we ’ ve heard thus far , although there are some interesting differences . Read more : Intel Core i9-9900K First up , the leak provides the spec for the Core i9-9900K top-end 9th-gen offering , which will have eight cores and 16 threads as previously rumored . What we didn ’ t know was the clock speed , which will supposedly be 3.6GHz for the base clock , with boost to 5GHz as we mentioned at the outset . Although note that like the recently released Core i7-8086K anniversary edition processor , that boost won ’ t apply across all cores – although rather than just a single-core affair , it will be good for two cores , at least according to this speculation . Boost across all cores will apparently reach 4.7GHz . Taking a step down to the Core i7-9700K , we previously heard this would be a six-core offering with 12 threads , but according to this new leak , it ’ s an eight-core processor with eight threads . It will have a base clock of 3.6GHz , and boost to 4.9GHz ( on a single core ) . Finally , the leak provides the spec of the Core i5-9600K . As with previous rumours , this is supposedly a six-core CPU with six threads , clocked at 3.7GHz with boost to 4.6GHz ( again , on a single core ) . All three processors are said to have a TDP of 95W . On the motherboard front , these chips are designed for the new Z390 , but allegedly they will also be compatible with existing Z370 boards . No further light is shed on pricing or a possible launch date , although previous buzz on the processor grapevine has indicated that Intel could at least unveil the 9th-gen chips shortly – possibly as soon as the start of next month .

The next wave of mobile-grade , fanless processors from Intel , ‘ Amber Lake , ’ just had what ’ s likely its entire lineup leaked through both Romanian technology news website NextLab 501 and a Dell product listing in Chile . Intel ’ s line of mobile-focused processors continues the existing trend of using the letter ‘ Y ’ to denote this range , though listing the lowest-end model as an ‘ m3 ’ chip rather than an ‘ i3 ’ . However , don ’ t assume this chip is cheap , as it ’ s a marked improvement upon the previous generation in clock speed . In fact , all three of the supposed new Y series Intel processors are improvements upon their predecessors , as they should be . All three processors are reportedly dual-core chips built on Intel ’ s now long-in-the-tooth 14-nanometer process using 5W of power to drive Intel UHD 615 graphics with a 4MB cache . Now , here ’ s the further breakdown regarding each of the three newly leaked Amber Lake chips , namely their names and clock speeds : According to NextLab ’ s report , these processors are expected to be ready for Q3 2018 , so that ’ s between July and September of this year . That would be just in time for a refresh of major laptops from Intel ’ s many partners , including the next Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 at the heart of this leak and even that fabled MacBook 2018 overhaul . Until then , we ’ ll be waiting with bated breath to see yet another named generation join Intel ’ s growing family of processors available . Via AppleInsider
Intel 9th generation processors rumors and leaks have hit a boiling point , and now we even have a possible release date . Supposedly , Intel will launch new Coffee Lake Refresh CPUs on August 1 with products said to release in the following weeks to months after that , according to PC Builders Club . What 's more the report suggest that multiple 9th generation processor samples were able to achieve a 5.5GHz overclock . Read more : HP EliteBook 745 G5 That said , this rumor comes from a German site with no proven track record being a reliable source , so we ’ re going to take this news with an extreme grain of salt . The report makes no mention of which processors Intel will launch first , though , we imagine Team Blue will want to kick off its next generation of processors with it ’ s first ever octa-core mainstream CPU – especially if Intel hope to steal away some of AMD Ryzen 2nd Generation ’ s thunder . The 9th generation Coffee Lake Refresh family of processors is already looking fairly extensive based on the information we ’ ve gathered so far . Hopefully the rumors are true and we ’ ll all soon have a swath of 9th generation Coffee Lake Refresh processors to choose from . Via HotHardware

China Mobile , Intel and Huawei have completed interoperability testing that should act as a catalyst for the commercialisation of 5G networking equipment . The first commercial 5G networks are expected to go live later this year , offering fixed wireless access ( FWA ) broadband to certain parts of the US . Meanwhile the first 5G compatible smartphones are set to arrive in 2019 , while 2020 will most likely see the first UK 5G network . But to get to that point , it is essential that networking kit from various vendors is able to work together . Samsung and Nokia for example have been working together to ensure the establishment of a “ healthy ecosystem ” . The operator announced its intention to launch 5G in 2019 at Mobile World Congress ( MWC ) earlier this year , aiding China ’ s hopes of being a leader in the field . These latest tests , conducted at the China Mobile Research Institute , used C-Band spectrum and the ‘ Release 15 ’ standard of 5G , which includes new radio technologies known as 5G New Radio ( 5G NR ) . This allowed the research partners to verify the compatibility of the 5G NR-compatible terminal and network . “ The success of this interoperability test can provide more kinds of terminals for the follow-up China Mobile 's 5G scale test , and also providing a large-scale verification of 5G , ” declared Huang Yuhong , head of the China Mobile Research Institute . “ China Mobile will release the first version of its 5G commercial product requirements this year and launch the first pre-commercial terminals in 2019 , which will play an important role in such areas as fixed home access , industry video and smart manufacturing . ” The three companies have said they will continue to work together to support the mobile industry , with China Mobile planning to hold more 5G trials in major cities .

Just a few days ago , we found speculation that the Intel Core i9 was coming to the mainstream as part of the 9th-generation Intel Core family . But , now it looks like Intel has made the 9th generation official in its latest microcode revision . Intel ’ s 9th generation Core family will be coming to market by the end of the year , according to official listings found by Wccftech . While we ’ ve already seen some speculation about the Core i9 and i7 chips , this listing is notable because , while it doesn ’ t include the higher-end chips , it does include the quad-core i3 chips that were missing from that earlier leak . So , it looks like Coffee Lake-S is going to be a full blown generation , meant to give Ryzen 2nd Generation some competition . However , it ’ s odd that the leaked processors from last week didn ’ t get an official listing . The octa-core Core i9-9900K and hexa-core i7-9700K are still without final specs , even though we believe they will be part of this generation at some point . The rumored 8-core , 16-thread Core i9-9900K will be necessary for giving AMD ’ s Ryzen 7 2700X some competition . These new processors are confirmed to be a refresh of the Coffee Lake architecture , which makes us think Cannon Lake is further off than we once thought . And , while we didn ’ t get confirmation of the high-end Core i9 and i7 we ’ ve seen rumored earlier , there were seven new processors listed in Intel ’ s document : We were initially thinking that Intel would be getting rid of the quad-core model with the Coffee Lake-S refresh , but it looks like that was unfounded , as there are two Core i3 models with this traditional core count . This listing also solidifies six cores as the new mainstream processor . This refresh will add some of the features present in the Coffee Lake-H laptop processors , like 802.11ac Wi-Fi and support for up to six Thunderbolt 3 ports – but motherboard manufacturers will have to add in support for that technology . What ’ s even more impressive is the fact that while maintaining the same core counts and TDPs , these 9th-generation Intel Core processors manage to slightly boost clock speeds . And , while this won ’ t be enough to justify Coffee Lake owners to go out and upgrade , it should convince some people with older processors .
A new leaked benchmark points to the fact that Apple likely has a MacBook Pro 2018 in the pipeline , which is driven by an Intel Coffee Lake processor , backing up previous speculation that this is the case . Like the leak from a month ago , this is a spilled benchmark from Geekbench , and so we have to take it with a generous pinch of salt – faking these sort of things is hardly beyond the realms of possibility . But assuming it ’ s on the money , the benchmark shows scores for a ‘ MacBookPro15,2 ’ laptop , which as Cult of Mac reports , would seemingly be a refresh of the MacBook Pro 13-inch ( given that the current-gen model is ‘ MacBookPro14,2 ’ ) . The CPU powering the notebook is the Core i7-8559U , which is a quad-core part that runs at 2.7GHz , and is capable of a beefy turbo to 4.5GHz . That ’ s quite different to the processor cited in the previous leak , which was the Core i7-8750H – that has six cores , but is clocked slower ( 2.2GHz with boost to 4.1GHz ) . The i7-8559U boasts integrated Iris Plus Graphics 655 and has a TDP of 28W . So how did this alleged revamped MacBook Pro 2018 perform in the benchmarks with the i7-8559U under the bonnet ? The machine achieved 4,448 in the single-core test , and 16,607 in the multi-core benchmark . That multi-core result is a big jump compared to last year ’ s MacBook Pro 13-inch , and indeed roughly speaking , it ’ s over 40 % faster . Incidentally , the previous leak of the six-core processor indicated a multi-core result of 22,316 . The six-core could be the CPU powering the MacBook Pro 15-inch , then , with the quad-core i7-8559U destined for the 13-inch model . But it ’ s all guesswork at this point , and indeed these rumors could simply be noise which eventually come to nothing . But if they are on the money , we ’ re looking at some considerably more powerful MacBook Pro machines which should be launching later this year . We ’ ve speculated that the launch could come in September , and at least according to the latest rumor via Bloomberg , we ’ re expecting not just a refreshed MacBook Pro later in 2018 , but a 12-inch MacBook packing new Intel silicon , plus a budget MacBook Air to tempt folks at the lower end of the market .

New sales stats from a popular German tech retailer have cast some light on the current state of the processor market , showing that while AMD has fought back with the recent launch of its Ryzen 2nd Generation chips , the firm hasn ’ t done enough to break the dominance of Intel ’ s Coffee Lake CPUs . According to Mindfactory.de , which we ’ ve seen figures from in the past , Intel captured 55 % of its processor sales in June 2018 , compared to 45 % for AMD . So it ’ s still a fairly tight race between the two chip giants , but AMD has failed to recover all the ground it has lost to Intel ’ s 8th-gen CPUs . Read more : Intel Core i9-9980XE As you may remember , with the launch of the original Ryzen processors , AMD really turned things around , and actually took the majority share of processor sales according to this particular retailer – by a margin of 56 % to 44 % by the time August 2017 rolled around . Intel had grabbed the majority share back come the end of last year , though , and pulled away to take a 61 % market share in January and February of this year , off the back of new Coffee Lake chips . That lead has since diminished , actually dropping to 51 % in May , but Intel has now moved up to a 55 % share in June as mentioned . In other words , the launch of the Ryzen 2nd Generation processors in April has had something of an impact in helping AMD to claw back market share , but Intel is still holding strong as the majority power despite Ryzen ’ s successor . Of course , it ’ s worth underlining that this is a very limited data sample set of just one source , which we can only draw limited conclusions from . But it ’ s still interesting to see the relative fluctuations nonetheless , and the fact that Ryzen 2nd Generation apparently hasn ’ t made nearly the same impact as the original CPUs . AMD ’ s bestselling processor remains to be the Ryzen 5 1600 , which , according to stats revealed in April by the German retailer , is the firm ’ s all time bestseller ( and has only been outsold by six Intel chips ) . Of the Ryzen 2nd Generation chips , the Ryzen 7 2700X put in a strong showing – it was the second-best processor for AMD in terms of sales . Neither of those offerings could hold a candle to Intel ’ s top dog , however : the mighty Core i7-8700K . The Core i5-8600K and Core i5-8400 were also very strong sellers for AMD ’ s rival . Further interesting observations include the fact that Intel ’ s Coffee Lake processors represent no less than 47 % of all CPUs sold – so very nearly half of all the chips flogged . And if you look at revenue rather than unit sales , Intel ’ s position is even stronger , with the company taking 62 % of the money being spent on processors by punters . That ’ s because Intel is better maintaining its prices , whereas AMD is lowering its price tags , particularly when it comes to the original Ryzen chips which have been reduced considerably compared to their recommended price at launch .

Intel has come clean to Anandtech regarding the level of Spectre and Meltdown protection within its new 8th-generation Whiskey Lake U series Core processors and 8th-gen Amber Lake Y series processors , concluding that its hardware-based defenses against the security flaws aren ’ t as extensive as we might have expected when Intel promised these fixes earlier this year . Update : Intel has provided TechRadar with the following statement on the matter : Read more : HP Spectre Folio `` Laptops powered by the new mobile 8th Gen Intel Core processors announced today are expected to ship from OEM and system manufacturers with protections for the security vulnerabilities commonly referred to as 'Spectre ' , 'Meltdown ' and 'L1TF ' . These protections include a combination of the hardware design changes we announced earlier this year as well as software and microcode updates . '' Anandtech created a helpful visual guide for exactly which Spectre and Meltdown defenses have been baked into the Whiskey Lake and Amber Lake hardware . Intel tells Anandtech that there are almost as many hardware fixes for the Whiskey Lake chips as there are in the upcoming Cascade Lake processors for servers . However , those don ’ t amount to much when you list out the current known variants of both security flaws . At that point , Whiskey Lake processors are only protected against two variants of Meltdown at the hardware level , with all other fixes being based on firmware and software . This means that it is possible for new workarounds to emerge that could circumvent Intel ’ s firmware and software-level fixes to these problems . And , if the nature of hackers has shown us anything , it ’ s only a matter of time before those we see those workarounds . In this regard , the Amber Lake line of chips isn ’ t protected at the hardware level at all . This is because Amber Lake is essentially a rehashing of the recently-released Kaby Lake Refresh processors – just at a smaller power draw of 5 watts for fanless designs – whereas Whiskey Lake is a more updated design on the same 14-nanometer process , allowing for some hardware-grade fixes . While the Spectre and Meltdown flaws aren ’ t widely targeting general consumers and more so businesses with servers hosting lots of data , it ’ s important for Intel to disclose vulnerabilities to attack and theft within their hardware regardless . That ’ s especially so considering how far we really are from true immunity to these security flaws .
Intel ’ s first mainstream Core i9 processor has been heavily rumored over the last few months , but now we might actually have our first ever photo of the highly anticipated Coffee Lake Refresh CPU . XFastest claims to have snapped up the first ever photo of the Intel Core i9-9900K - with its top off no less . This was to highlight and confirm the rumors that say Intel is going with a soldered integrated heat spreader ( IHS ) to support greater overclocking capabilities . For the last few generations of chips , Intel has gone with a Thermal Interface Material ( TIM – aka thermal paste ) to transfer heat between the processor dies and the IHS . In theory , this purported gold-plated solder will replace the TIM and be a much more efficient heat transfer medium . Intel ’ s use of thermal paste has been a sore spot of enthusiasts and overclockers leading many to ‘ delid ’ their processors in an attempt to replace the TIM with a more efficient solution . It ’ s been an even bigger point of criticism lately as AMD went with a soldered IHS on all of its Ryzen 2nd Generation processors . Via Wccftech

Before you ask , these aren ’ t the Intel Cannon Lake processors you were hoping for . Rather , today Intel is launching its third-series of 8th Generation mobile processors , promising slightly improved performance over Coffee Lake and much greater focus on connectivity . Read more : AcePC AK7 thin client PC Intel ’ s three new new 8th Gen Intel Core U-series processors ( code-named Whisky Lake ) : the Core i7-8565U , i5-8265U and i3-8145U , will come with integrated Intel Wireless-AC modules for Gigabit Wi-Fi for up to 12 times faster connectivity speeds . Intel also promises Whisky Lake CPUs will garner two times better performance , compared to a 5-year-old PC . Compared to a 7th Generation Kaby Lake processor , we supposedly can expect double-digit gains in office productivity for everyday web browsing and light content creation . As with every iteration of its processor , Intel expects laptops and 2-in-1 devices will last even longer , up to between 16 and 19 hours on a single charge . The chip maker has also said gamers on the go will be able to play ‘ World of Warcraft : Battle for Azeroth ’ and ‘ World of Tanks ’ with ease using just its integrated graphics alone . Lastly , the new U-series processor can also support Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos immersive audio . All of these improvements comes by way of the 8th Generation platform 's new PCH , which integrates a quad-core audio DSP and integrated wireless MAC to support the 802.11AC w/ 160MHz channels . It remains to be seen whether these processor will replace the Coffee Lake processors Intel just announced in April 2018 or the Kaby Lake-Refresh processor that launched a year ago , or will they just sit alongside the existing two families as an option for users who want to stay connected . Intel also introduced a new trio of Y-Series 8th Generation Amber Lake processors ( including the Core i7-8500Y , i5-8200Y , m3-8100Y ) that bring forth even more connectivity support . Unlike the new Whisky Lake CPUs , Amber Lake does n't integrate built-in Wi-Fi modules . But it does support Gigabit Wi-Fi by way of external or discrete modules , and it has preloaded eSIM support for Intel ’ s Gigabit LTE modems . Now , that doesn ’ t mean these new Y-series chips come with a built-in LTE module , like Qualcomm ’ s Snapdragon 835 chips inside always online Windows 10 devices . Rather , it just has the eSIM support ready for manufacturers who also want to include an LTE modem in the device . The integrated graphics on Y-series chips has also been slightly improved , giving users the ability to watch 1080p , 4K or 360 videos ( and preview multiple video streams ) with ease . An Intel spokesperson also told us we can expect up to 9.5 hours of battery life while playing a 4K 10bit HEVC video on local playback . Intel promises that these new Y-series chips will deliver double-digit gains in performance compared to the previous generation processors in the thinnest and lightest laptops and 2-in-1s on the market . Otherwise , there ’ s improved touch and stylus interaction for users who want to sketch , shade and paint with precision on an Amber Lake-powered touchscreen device . The silicon company expects the new Y-series chips will enable thin-and-light designs less than 7 millimeters thick and lighter than 1 pound .

Intel Coffee Lake Refresh processors are still a ways off from their rumored October release , but apparently users are already overclocking engineering samples , according to this latest leak . The Intel Core i7-9700K was purportedly spotted overclocking at 5.5537GHz across all eight cores by ZOL . The Intel Core i7-9700K is thus far rumored to be an 8-core and 8-thread part , which normally operates between 3.6GHz to 4.6GHz , and boosts up to 4.9GHz with single-core Turbo Boost 3 – so this supposed overclock frequency is well above the norm . Read more : HP EliteBook 745 G5 While the processor was in this overclocked state , the unnamed users also benchmarked the chip with Cinebench R15 and the processor delivered a single-core result of 250cb and multi-core result of 1,827cb . Comparatively , the Intel Core i7-8700K delivered 193cb and 1,408 scores in the same respective single- and multi-core tests . Meanwhile , the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X gave us a 177cb result in single-core and 1,798cb in multi-core . From all of this , we can see the greatest improvement the 9700K will supposedly bring while overclocked is single-core performance . However , we ’ re a bit worried the multi-core performance at such a high frequency is just barely ahead of a Ryzen 7 2700X operating normally . The post on ZOL also details the chip was tested on an ASRock Z370 Professional Gaming motherboard and G.Skill DDR4-2133 RAM – so this is far from an ideal testing situation . We ’ d likely get even better performance with faster memory and Intel ’ s rumored ( and basically confirmed ) Z390 platform . Via HotHardware

Intel Core i7-9700K and i9-9900K processors have showed up for preorder on European retailers , fueling speculation that the release is right around the corner . We previously reported on a leaked Intel roadmap which pointed to the Core i5 , i7 and i9 Coffee Lake-S models launching on October 1 . CentralPoint , the retailer that posted the early pre-order ( and has since taken it down ) , said that it would be getting stock on September 7 , as reported by Wccftech . If this is true , it would seem to back up that October 1 release date . The Core i9-9900K is being listed by Netherlands-based retailer Dutch Computer Centre for €561 ( about $ 652 , £507 ) , which would fall in line with what we ’ d expect a Core i9 processor to cost . This is likely a placeholder price , though , and we ’ ll see official pricing once Intel actually announces these next-generation processors . What we want to know is what ’ s going on with the rest of the 9th-generation lineup . We ’ ve only really seen solid information about the high-end parts , with only shaky leaks and speculation to guide our hand when it comes to the Core i5 and i3 lineup . Some of these low-end processors did show up on a leaked microcode revision , but as it wasn ’ t published by Intel directly , we have to take it with a grain of salt . Either way , October 1 is coming fast , so we ’ ll see whether any of this information is accurate one way or another . We expect the pricing at least to change . Hopefully Intel will cater to the mid-range as well – Ryzen 2nd Generation is unforgiving competition these days .

While Nvidia just released its RTX 20 series of graphics cards , all but trouncing AMD ’ s latest and most powerful cards , it may have another challenger to consider before this series is through : Intel . The firm recently teased its launch of discrete graphics cards for 2020 . This will mark the first time in more than 20 years that Nvidia will have competition other than AMD in the graphics card market . However , judging by where Intel ’ s best integrated graphics – graphics cores embedded into the CPU platform – are right now , the company has quite a bit of catching up to do , especially if it plans to expand upon its current GPU to power these . So , let ’ s put into perspective just how far Intel needs to come from its integrated graphics platform to meet or exceed what Nvidia ’ s best is capable of – on paper . For this theoretical ( and highly speculative ) experiment , assuming Intel builds upon its existing technology , we ’ re looking at three key performance metrics in the Intel UHD Graphics 630 graphics and how they compare to the flagship Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti . That way , should Intel ’ s discrete graphics card launch beat Nvidia to the punch in updating its hardware come 2020 , we ’ ll see the bar Intel must raise by then if it wants to be competitive . Right off the bat , we know that the graphics processing unit ( GPU ) inside Nvidia ’ s RTX 2080 Ti operates at a base clock speed of 1,350 MHz , and can be boosted up to 1,635 MHz using basic tools . Intel ’ s UHD Graphics 630 GPU runs at a base speed of just 350 MHz , though it can be boosted to up to 1,200 MHz using the dynamic frequency feature . Here , Intel needs to improve its GPU ’ s base clock speed by roughly 285 % , or by 3.8 times , to simply meet the RTX 2080 Ti on its own terms . That said , the Intel GPU ’ s boosted speed isn ’ t terribly far off as is – just 36 % shy . As for how quickly the RTX 2080 Ti can simultaneously process , this GPU ’ s memory bandwidth is 616 gigabytes per second ( GB/s ) . Intel ’ s GPU currently has to share memory bandwidth with the processor itself , at 41.6 GB/s . Intel ’ s looking at a whopping 1,380 % – or 14 times – increase in memory bandwidth for its GPU if it wants to compete . That said , Intel ’ s GPU can currently use up to 64GB of general-use memory for the purposes of storing graphic textures , whereas the RTX 2080 is stuck with the card ’ s onboard 11GB of video memory . However , Nvidia ’ s graphics memory is much faster than any standard DDR4 memory out there , at 14 gigabits per second ( Gbps ) compared to DDR4 coming in at around 3.2 to 4.2 Gbps . Here , Intel ’ s GPU will need to up its memory speed by 233 % , or roughly three times . Obviously , Intel will not employ general use memory in whatever graphics card it creates , but rather GDDR6 or HBM2 memory , used by Nvidia and AMD , respectively . Or , Intel could surprise us all with an interesting application of its memory-like Intel Optane storage technology . Either way , Intel ’ s GPU is going to need much more capacious and speedy memory attached than Intel silicon is used to . Again , this analysis is highly speculative and assumes that Intel will simply expand its existing UHD Graphics platform as the GPU powering its 2020 graphics cards . It also assumes that Nvidia will keep to its own two-year cadence for generational leaps . Regardless , this is just how sharply Intel ’ s GPU technology needs to improve by 2020 to properly challenge Nvidia ’ s current best work . Time to get cracking , Blue Team .
On the security front , Microsoft has pushed out a new batch of microcode updates for Windows 10 which mitigate against the Foreshadow vulnerability , along with additional Spectre variants . As ZDNet spotted , the microcode patches , piped over from Intel , address the following flaws in the company ’ s processors : Spectre variant 3a ( ‘ rogue system register read ’ ) and variant 4 ( ‘ speculative store bypass ’ ) , along with Foreshadow , a fresh vulnerability that came to light earlier this month , which hit the firm ’ s high-end Core and Xeon processors . Read more : Mii Mini PC The patches have been released for all versions of Windows 10 , as well as for Windows Server . Microsoft started releasing Intel ’ s microcode updates to Windows users back in March , hoping to bolster security for the users of the OS , and offering an extra channel to receive protection in case users haven ’ t had the CPU patches through from hardware manufacturers ( via firmware updates , which can take some time to concoct and deploy ) . Obviously , it ’ s good to see these sort of countermeasures pushed forward by whatever means possible , particularly when a new threat has popped up . Foreshadow is a worrying little beast which is ( unsurprisingly ) impervious to the protection put in place for Meltdown and Spectre , and it doesn ’ t leave any traces either , so the user won ’ t likely know that they ’ ve been hit . Intel has promised that CPUs released down the line will have protection against Foreshadow baked in .

We pretty much have the full picture of the upcoming Intel Coffee Lake Refresh , thanks to slides from leaked presentation . The 9th generation Intel Coffee Lake Refresh processors will purportedly launch in October with three models , including the Core i9-9900K , Core i7-9700K and Core i5-9600K , according to documents submitted anonymously to Videocardz . What ’ s more , we have a complete list of specs for each of the processors : All of Intel ’ s 9th Generation CPUs will supposedly feature a 95W thermal design power ( TDP ) , or how much power it can draw from the power supply– surprisingly , including the Core i9 octo-core part – with support for up to 40 lanes of PCIe , DDR4-2,666MHz memory and a new Z390 chipset . Coffee Lake Refresh CPUs will still supposedly be compatible with all Intel 300 series chipsets though . The documents also show Intel ’ s first mainstream Core i9 octa-core CPU has been given a special S-series designation and the company ’ s first soldered head spreader ( called the Solder Thermal Interface Material ) in a very long time . For the last several generations , Intel ’ s chips have only made use of internal layer of thermal compound to transfer heat from the processor dies to the exterior heat spreader , much to the derision from enthusiast PC builders and overclockers . Out of all the recent leaks , these look like the closest thing to the actual slides we would see during a briefing . The rumored details are both exciting and disappointing because October is so far away . Be sure to stay locked to TechRadar as we ’ ll report on any new developments as they come .
ARM has come out with some fighting talk when it comes to how its processors stack up against Intel ’ s in the world of laptop CPUs . In a processor roadmap shared in a press release on the topic of ‘ accelerating laptop performance ’ , ARM said it ’ s expecting to deliver performance improvements of 15 % year-on-year going through to 2020 . Noting that this is a trajectory which surpasses Moore ’ s Law , ARM also shared a graph which showed that its freshly-revealed Cortex-A76 is roughly on par with Intel ’ s Core i5-7300U laptop CPU – and that the upcoming Deimos ( 2019 , 7nm process ) and Hercules ( 2020 , 7nm and 5nm ) chips will comfortably blaze past the level of performance of the Core i5 . However , as Engadget ( which spotted this ) points out , ARM is obviously fudging things slightly here by not offering a comparison with Intel ’ s latest 8th-gen family of mobile processors , and furthermore by cherry-picking one particular benchmark to highlight . Of course , a marketing angle is expected in these sort of releases , but it ’ s clear that ARM is moving swiftly in the right direction , and the details shared could give Intel ’ s engineers cause for concern when it comes to the notebook market . ARM said that down the line it expects to “ level the performance playing field against mass-market laptop CPUs from the competition ” . The firm further added that : “ Arm POP IP is already helping to enable laptop-class performance in 7nm SoCs based on Cortex-A76 by giving our partners the opportunity to push the clock-speed past 3.0GHz and up to 3.3GHz within power envelopes around half that of today ’ s mass-market x86 processors . ” Naturally , ARM also took the time to underline the fact that we are swiftly moving towards a 5G world , and that the likes of ARM-based always-connected laptops with Snapdragon SoCs will increasingly offer more in terms of not just performance , but better power efficiency and longer battery life , along with the ability to potentially drive slimmer and lighter notebooks and 2-in-1s . There ’ s still some way to go though , looking at the current crop of Snapdragon portables , such as the Asus NovaGo ( pictured ) , which we weren ’ t hugely impressed with in terms of its actual performance figures , and some elements of the hardware , most notably the keyboard .

Intel has just introduced a new range of NUC devices that feature upgraded components that allow these compact PCs to better handle advanced tasks and popular games such as League of Legends . Intel NUCs ( Next Unit of Computing ) are small , yet powerful , PCs that can sit unobtrusively in an office or even a front room , making them excellent little devices for both productivity and entertainment . The new NUC kits are barebones boxes that come with basic hardware and allow you to add your own components to create a box that ’ s suited to your needs . The kits ( NUC8i7BEH , NUC8i5BEH , NUC8i5BEK , NUC8i3BEH and NUC8i3BEK ) went by the codename Bean Canyon and feature 8th generation Coffee Lake-U Intel Core i7 , i5 and i3 processors . These chips come with Intel Iris integrated graphics , which should be enough to power media applications , and maybe the odd casual game . Users can add their own choice of storage , memory and operating system . If you like the compact design of the NUC kits but aren ’ t too keen on installing extra hardware yourself , then the new fully-built NUC mini PCs ( NUC8i3CYSM and NUC8i3CYSN ) , which were code-named Crimson Canyon , will be more to your liking . These come with 8th Gen Intel Core i3-8121U Cannon Lake processors and include a discrete Radeon 540 2GB graphics card . This is the first time NUC devices have featured a discrete GPU ( rather than an integrated graphics chip ) , and this extra graphical power allows the new NUCs to play popular games at 1080p resolution . We caught a glimpse of these devices playing Counterstrike : Go , and the gameplay definitely looked smooth and responsive . While it ’ s not the most graphically-intensive game , it ’ s a good showcase for how these tiny PCs can run popular , competitive , games , and can be easily carried around . The mini PCs also come with 1TB of storage , 4GB or 8GB of RAM , Windows 10 , two HDMI 2.0a ports and four USB 3.0 ports . These new NUC devices will be available in September , and we ’ ve contacted Intel to find out pricing information .
Back in June , news emerged that Intel is planning to release its own discrete graphics cards in 2020 , and the chip giant has now posted a teaser for these incoming GPUs . Released to coincide with SIGGRAPH 2018 , Intel published the short video clip on Twitter , although it ’ s really a marketing pitch , and sadly doesn ’ t reveal any further details about exactly what form these graphics cards will take . As you can see for yourself below , the video confirms that Intel ’ s discrete GPUs are still planned for 2020 , which is the year “ we [ Intel ] will set our graphics free . ” We will set our graphics free . # SIGGRAPH2018 pic.twitter.com/vAoSe4WgZXAugust 15 , 2018 What ’ s interesting here , then , is the importance Intel is putting on these graphics cards , building up hype already , including ending the clip with the phrase : “ And that ’ s just the beginning . ” Yes , you could say that ’ s just more marketing guff , but it infers that Intel is really serious about building on this incoming line of GPUs , and this is a very big thing for the company . Towards the end of the video , we do actually get to see some glimpses of what is presumably some kind of a prototype ( or mock-up ) card , which appears to be a single board with a PCIe connector ( there ’ s also a fleeting moment where you get to see a small metal-bladed fan ) . As to where Intel ’ s GPUs will be pitched , as we reported recently , the cards are set to be aimed at both gamers and data centers alike , so there should be consumer and heavyweight models , as is the case with the other big graphics card manufacturers . One thing is for sure : a third horse in the GPU race will be a welcome in terms of making the arena more competitive , which might have a positive effect on pricing . Particularly if Intel needs to do something compelling on the pricing front to force its way into the market . As ever , we shall see what unfolds , but it will definitely be good to get a proper look at what Intel is planning , which will hopefully happen sooner rather than later ( perhaps at CES 2019 , according to the rumor mill ) .

Intel is facing a fresh security headache following the news that its hardware is being hit by a major new vulnerability . The Foreshadow flaw had been identified by security researchers who say that all Intel hardware released after 2015 could be affected , with cloud computing systems and virtual machines also affected for the first time . The vulnerability could allow third parties or hackers to access personal information on an Intel-powered device , with many of the company 's top-end Core and Xeon processors among the products affected . Intel has posted a full list of affected hardware on its website , but says that it was `` not aware '' of the flaw being utilised in real-world exploits at this time . Foreshadow was uncovered in joint research by researchers at KU Leuven university in Belgium and the universities of Michigan and Adelaide . The team notified Intel of the attack back in January , but is separate from that seen in the work on the Spectre and Meltdown attacks uncovered in the same month . The attack is different from Meltdown as it targets virtual machines as well as the data stored on a device ( which was the method of the earlier attack ) The team notes that Foreshadow is also resistant to the systems used to block Meltdown , and also can get around protection set up to stop the Spectre attacks . Users will also most likely not be able to detect if they have been affected by the new attack , as Foreshadow does not leave traces . Intel has already released a patch that it says will stop the issue , and states that future processors will be tweaked in order to not be affected by Foreshadow . Individual VM and cloud providers will need to produce their own workarounds , however , with the likes of AWS , Google and Microsoft Azure confirming they have already done so .

Although it was previously looking like we wouldn ’ t see any of Intel ’ s 9th-generation processors until early on in 2019 , a new leaked document has revealed that part of the family may be seeing light of day on October 1 , 2018 . Sources close to Wccftech have reported that three of Intel ’ s flagship desktop processors in the 9000 series will land on October 1 , with the remainder of the family being released in the first quarter of 2019 . These three CPUs are : Among the three CPUs is Intel ’ s first mainstream desktop Core i9 release , as well as the first octa-core with 16 threads , but it wasn ’ t just the three aforementioned processors that the document exposed . The clock speeds , cache size and thermal design power ( TDP ) of the entire 9th-gen family was also revealed in the leaked document , as well as approximate pricing for the three flagships . Below is a table with the divulged details , courtesy of Wccftech : While all of this information is technically still a rumor , the mounting evidence seems to support this timeline . While you hang in there for Intel ’ s next generation of CPUs to launch , make sure to stay tuned to our Intel Coffee Lake page for all the latest news , rumors , and leaks .

Intel has revealed a major focus towards AI development as it looks to push towards new areas of computing . The hardware giant is set to pursue , `` a new era of data-centric computing '' through development of its Xeon chips as it moves away from its traditional PC focus . The company revealed that Intel 's AI-focused Xeon processors brought in $ 1bn in revenues during 2017 , with the company boasting customers such as Google , CERN and Huawei . Intel says that it now expects that potential revenues for its `` data-centric '' businesses could reach $ 200bn by 2022 as a smarter and more connected world generates more data than ever before . Speaking at the company 's Innovation Summit in Santa Clara , Navin Shenoy , executive VP and GM of Intel ’ s data center group , highlighted the move towards the new era . He revealed that new breakthroughs mean that Intel chips have seen a 200x improvement in AI processing since 2014 , with more to come soon . Shenoy highlighted that the company is hard at work putting the final touches to its new Cascade Lake platform , set for launch later this year , as well as its future Cooper Lake and Ice Lake releases - the latter of which is Intel 's first 10nm release . `` The proliferation of the cloud beyond hyperscale and into the network and out to the edge , the impending transition to 5G , and the growth of AI and analytics have driven a profound shift in the market , creating massive amounts of largely untapped data , '' he said . `` To help our customers move , store and process massive amounts of data , we have actionable plans to win in the highest growth areas , and we have an unparalleled portfolio to fuel our growth – including , performance-leading products and a broad ecosystem that spans the entire data-centric market .

AMD has leaked a performance benchmark for its imminent monster 32-core Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX processor , which shows it blazing past Intel ’ s Core i9-7980XE flagship chip . According to details which were apparently accidentally posted on the AMD France web page , as spotted by Wccftech.com , it ’ s billed as the ‘ most powerful desktop processor in the world ’ , and in the Cinebench R15 CPU benchmark it hit 5,099 on average . That compares to a score of 3,335 for the Intel Core i9-7980XE ( which is an 18-core processor ) , and it means that the AMD chip is 53 % faster than its rival flagship . Of course , while the 7980XE might be the beefiest chip in the Core series right now , its core count is considerably less than the Threadripper 2990WX . While Intel does have a 28-core beast on the horizon – capable of running at a gobsmacking 5GHz – that particular processor is going to cost a fortune , and won ’ t be destined for consumer PCs ( but rather enterprise outfits with deep pockets ) . It ’ s also worth noting that AMD ran this particular Cinebench test on June 26 , so it was a while back , and used a sample 2990WX chip ; meaning the finished production version of the processor will run even more speedily . Since we originally posted this news , AMD has officially unveiled the first four new processors in its Ryzen Threadripper 2nd Generation lineup . Spec details of the Threadripper 2990WX have already been spilled , and the chip is expected to be able to achieve a base clock of 3GHz with boost to 4GHz across its 32-cores . And it will drive a little further on a single core , reaching up to 4.2GHz boost . Rumor has it that the price for this AMD offering will be pitched at $ 1,799 ( around £1,390 , AU $ 2,440 ) , and that will undercut the Core i9-7980XE by a couple of hundred bucks . In the light of this benchmark , that ’ s pretty impressive stuff from Intel ’ s rival . And doubtless it will provoke some sort of response on the pricing front… If you don ’ t want to spend quite that much on a processor , AMD ’ s Threadripper 2nd Generation will obviously include some cheaper options , and as we saw last week , the 24-core Ryzen Threadripper 2970WX will be the next step down , allegedly weighing in at $ 1,299 ( around £1,000 , AU $ 1,760 ) . The least wallet-damaging chip will be the Threadripper 2920X 12-core processor at $ 649 ( around £500 , AU $ 880 ) .

It looks like AMD is finally on the comeback in the processor world , with boosted sales for July 2018 , meaning that the chipmaker has drawn level with big rival Intel , at least according to the latest figures from a major German tech retailer . Obviously that ’ s a limited assessment of the processor market to say the least , but the stats from retailer Mindfactory show that sales are now bang on level-pegging : AMD has 50 % of the market , and Intel the other 50 % . That ’ s interesting , because June ’ s figures showed Intel was in the lead with a 55 % market share , and it has been dominating with its 8th-gen processors since the start of the year . Indeed the chip giant had a 61 % dominance back in January and February , as we ’ ve previously reported . So the narrative is that AMD has managed to claw back onto level terms ( previously , going back further to the summer of 2017 , AMD actually led with a 56 % market share ) . Why have the scales tipped back in AMD ’ s favor ? The obvious drivers are the fact that AMD has some tasty new Ryzen 2nd Generation processors on offer , which are finally making more of an impact , plus it has discounted the prices of its various Ryzen chips ( particularly the original offerings , in the light of the 2nd Generation launch , of course ) . The fact that AMD has been knocking down prices is reflected in the relative share of revenue , with Intel having a solid lead in this respect . If we look at the money coined in rather than the pure number of units shifted , Intel took 58 % of the revenue that went through Mindfactory ’ s tills . These are interesting statistics to examine , for sure , but it ’ s worth repeating that they are drawn from one sole source , so hardly a reflection of the entire market . Another interesting nugget comes in the breakdown of Intel ’ s processor sales – no less than 86 % of those sold were Coffee Lake ( 8th-gen ) CPUs . Almost all of the chips flogged , in other words . AMD had a much broader three-way split , with Pinnacle Ridge ( Ryzen 2nd Generation ) consisting of 44 % of sales , Summit Ridge at 31 % , and Raven Ridge on 22 % . Threadripper CPUs accounted for 2 % of unit sales . Via Wccftech.com

It seems like everyone and their mother has their hands on Intel ’ s desktop processor roadmaps , as two more leaks have revealed the company ’ s release schedule for the coming year . First up , WccfTech claims to have exclusively acquired Intel ’ s latest desktop roadmap that covers 2018 through the Q3 2019 timeline – and there ’ s quite a lot to break down here . While we reported recently that Intel 9th generation processors wouldn ’ t release until next year , WccfTech says the roadmap leaked prior to this was vastly outdated , and we should expect Coffee Lake-S Refresh processors within the next few months . These new Coffee Lake-S Refresh CPUs will supposedly include 8- , 6- , 4- and 2-core chips – potentially squashing the rumor that dual-core processors were going away – with a maximum TDP of 95W . The leaked roadmap also confirms that these new chips will be compatible with both Intel ’ s upcoming Z390 chipset as well as its older 300-series chipsets . In another twist , it seems like we ’ ll soon get more high-end desktop CPUs than we bargained for . The Basin Falls X-series will purportedly roll out before Coffee Lake-S Refresh , bringing us 18- , 16- , 14- , 12 , 10- , 8- and even 6-core processors . Before the end of the year , we ’ ll apparently also see Basin Falls Refresh processors , but there aren ’ t really any more details on what this series will entail other than it will socket into X299 motherboards . Intel will supposedly have yet another series of Glacier Falls chips release in the third quarter of 2019 , though , there ’ s even less information on this rumored line of silicon . Intel previously revealed 28-core processor is a curious omission from all of the series above , but apparently it has been sectioned off as into a separate Skylake-X A-series classification of its own . Despite all the different series names , almost all the CPUs rumored above fall under the Skylake-X architecture with the exception of Glacier Falls that is said to introduce Cascade Lake-X . As if WccfTech ’ s roadmap didn ’ t reveal enough information , HKEPC also got its hands on another release schedule that may break down Intel ’ s plans going into next June . Intel 9th generation processors could come as soon as this October – though this doesn ’ t quite line up with WccfTech 's ‘ latest ’ roadmap . What does match between these two roadmaps is that in the same month Intel will supposedly introduce Intel Core X-series chips , including a 18-core 165W , under the Basin Falls Refresh banner . It ’ s tough to judge the validity of either of these leaked roadmaps . While they match the style and format of Intel slideshows we ’ ve seen before , we ’ ll always take leaked documents with a grain ( or two ) of salt , as they can be easily doctored or even fabricated completely . That said , we ’ re holding out just a little bit of hope they ’ re real as they finally shed light on Intel ’ s largely absent plans in the face of AMD Ryzen 2nd Generation and AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2nd Generation processors .

Earlier this year , we ’ ve already been hearing about AMD making a comeback in terms of processor sales , and a new report suggests that the chip manufacturer could soon be sitting pretty with a 30 % share of the desktop CPU market . This comes from DigiTimes , a common – albeit sometimes erratic – source of tech rumors , which claims AMD will hit a 30 % processor market share in the fourth-quarter of 2018 according to industry sources . Exercise caution around this speculation , given that it ’ s only a prediction coming from unspecified sources who notes that drastic changes in AMD ’ s foundry strategy – principally getting on board with TSMC to make CPUs and GPUs with a 7nm process – are helping to pump up AMD 's momentum . As we said at the outset , we ’ ve already seen evidence of AMD selling more processors – albeit from the limited perspective of one major tech retailer – and DigiTimes further observes that Intel ’ s delay in launching 10nm ( Cannon Lake ) CPUs has also helped AMD ’ s cause . Indeed , just a couple of months ago , we heard from Intel that Cannon Lake processors won ’ t ship in volume until the second half of 2019 , with consumer PCs not going on sale until the very end of next year . And that ’ s assuming things don ’ t slip further , which could be possible given the well-documented difficulties Intel has had in refining 10nm yields to an acceptable level for mass production . ( Remember that Cannon Lake was first expected to ship in 2016 ) . When you put that together with the news of Intel ’ s recent supply issues with current 14nm CPUs , causing stock shortages and rising prices , and perhaps it ’ s not surprising that AMD ’ s Ryzen processors – which are suffering no such production problems – are consequently benefiting and taking up the slack . As DigiTimes notes , PC manufacturers are increasingly turning to AMD ’ s CPUs rather than Intel ’ s thin-on-the-ground chips . The reports cites Asus , MSI , Gigabyte and ASRock as having ‘ ramped up ’ the shipment of devices carrying AMD processors . This has apparently driven AMD ’ s desktop processor market share to more than 20 % in Q3 , with the expected 30 % figure to be reached in the next quarter . Remember , this is all forecasting and speculation , but it fits together to make a believable proposition for the near future . AMD becoming more competitive in the processor market can only be a good thing for the consumer , putting more pressure on Intel to perform , and perhaps looking at its pricing for current CPUs if there are going to be issues with further delays in the drop to 10nm and Cannon Lake . Assuming those stock problems which are inflating Intel ’ s prices can be sorted , of course , and the company certainly claimed it has things under control in a statement issued earlier this month .

Qualcomm has accused Apple of sharing confidential information with competitors in a bid to secure cheaper components for the iPhone . The two companies are engaged in a wide-ranging legal battle in which Qualcomm has claimed Apple has violated its patents , while Apple says Qualcomm is abusing its dominant position in the market and charging extortionate fees . As part of its agreement with Qualcomm , Apple was granted access to the former ’ s source code and software to modify it for use with the iPhone on the condition this was kept confidential . However , Qualcomm believes Apple shared the log files from the software with Intel engineers . It says that this would help Intel improve its own technology and allow Apple to source cheaper components , costing Qualcomm potentially billions of dollars . Qualcomm wants its latest allegation to be added to a lawsuit filed in 2017 which alleged Apple violated the terms of their supplier agreement by resisting efforts to audit compliance , according to Reuters . Apple has counter-claimed that Qualcomm has not disclosed which information was allegedly shared and also that it gave the company a chance to verify compliance . Qualcomm ’ s modem technology has been used in several iterations of the iPhone , but since the iPhone 7 , Apple has diversified its supplier base , using Intel chips in some handsets . However , Qualcomm believes its modems have been completely eliminated from the most recent iPhones , a belief that is supported by independent teardowns . The iPhone XS , XS Max and XR were detailed earlier this month with the former two models now available in the UK .

The Intel Optane 905p series of solid state drives ( SSDs ) is very fast ( check out our Intel Optane 905P review to find out just how fast it is ) , and Intel has just announced a new 1.5TB capacity for the speedy storage . Until recently , the Intel Optane 905p series , which is based on the 3D XPoint memory standard , went up to 960GB , but for people who need huge capacities as well as fast performance ( such as photographers and video editors ) the new 1.5TB size will be a very welcome addition . With read and write speeds up to 2.7GBps and 2.2GBps respectively , and 575,000 IOPS read and 550,000 IOPs write ( 4KB random ) , this is a seriously fast drive . It ’ s also the largest capacity these sort of drives have so far managed . The new 1.5TB Intel Optane 905p SSD comes in a U.2 form factor , as well as an AIC ( Add in Card ) design , giving you a bit of flexibility over how to install it . We don ’ t currently have a price , but going by the rest of the 905p family , don ’ t expect this to be cheap . The kind of speeds offered by these SSDs are certainly very impressive , but they might be overkill for regular use . However , for moving huge amounts of data very quickly , this SSD will likely be the best of the best . Via Wccftech

Rumors of Intel switching back to soldered processors is looking a little more certain every day , and now we ’ ve gotten our most official confirmation from a computer hardware maker . Eurocom , a maker of high-end gaming and workstations laptops , confirmed to OC3D that Intel ’ s upcoming Core i9-9900K and Core i7-9700K will indeed come with soldered integrated heat spreaders ( IHS ) . In theory , soldered Coffee Lake Refresh processors will deliver much improved thermal performance than Intel ’ s previous generations of chips , and this in turn could lead to massive increases in overclocking capacity . This seems to be exactly the case , given that we ’ ve seen reports of the Intel Core i7-9700K hitting speeds of 5.5GHz while liquid-cooled and at 5.3GHz while air-cooled . `` New Intel [ Core ] i9-9900K and [ Core ] i7-9700K CPUs are coming with gold soldered TIM/IHS to the CPU die . This should help manage the temperatures of the higher-clocked CPUs and will also help with achieving higher overclocked frequencies . Our Sky ' C ' super-laptops are ready for 9900K /9700K . '' Ever since Intel introduced Ivy Bridge CPUs in April 2012 , the company replaced the soldered IHS it had used for years with a cheaper Thermal Interface Material ( TIM – aka thermal paste ) . Unfortunately for Intel , the change in manufacturing seemingly resulted in hotter running processors , which infuriated many enthusiast users and overclockers . We ’ ve heard and seen rumors of Intel going back to a gold-plated solder , but Eurocom is our most official source yet , as the company is an actual hardware maker rather an unknown leaker . Eurocom even claims partial credit for convincing Intel to go back to a soldered IHS by pressuring the company for years to make the swap . Via PC Gamer Lead image credit : XFastest

AMD has revealed more on its processor work as it gets up for the launch of its next-generation hardware . One year on from the launch of its first-generation EPYC server chips , the company updated media on how the platform is comparing against its great rival Intel . The company is due to reveal the second raft of its chips , codenamed Rome , later this year , with a public launch set for next year . The launch plays a critical part of AMD ’ s ongoing campaign to take on Intel in the battle for market supremacy , and the company is increasingly bullish about its value proposition versus the competition . `` The value proposition for EPYC is so severely superior to what the competition is building that we 're doubling down and focusing energy on winning market share in this space '' , Daniel Bounds , senior director of AMD ’ s data centre and embedded solutions group , said at a media briefing in London today . Bounds presented an update on the first year performance of EPYC , which launched last June as part of a high-end campaign to topple Intel ’ s dominance in the data centre space . He noted that EPYC has already been able to capture a significant proportion of several key markets , and has a great opportunity in the virtualization and cloud space , which according to IDC represents 55 percent of the overall 2 socket server market . Part of this is thanks to EPYC ’ s ability to reducing licensing costs and overall total cost of ownership ( TCO ) , potentially saving companies hundreds of thousands . EPYC also offers sturdier security protection against threats such as Foreshadow , Bounds noted , unlike Intel ’ s offerings , which required signficiant patching to be secure . `` Our view is you can either choose performance , or you can choose security - our view is that EPYC is the only choice , as you do n't need to choose , ” he noted . “ We 're in a constant state of expansion with our partner network ” he added , “ the broader ecosystem really matters to us ... that 's how we win . ”

AMD ’ s incoming monster 64-core Epyc ( server-targeted ) processor built on its new 7nm process boasts some quite astonishing performance levels , if a leaked benchmark which has just emerged is real . The benchmark was highlighted by Chiphell ( as spotted by Techquila ) and shows how the 64-core CPU performs in Cinebench R15 ’ s multi-threaded test , achieving a colossal score of 12,587 . That ’ s very nearly 10 times quicker than Intel ’ s Xeon X5650 , which is the server processor listed in the leaked benchmark result for comparison – although note that is a 12-core part , and a very old one at that ( it was first launched in 2010 ) . To give a more contemporary perspective , AMD ’ s Threadripper 2990WX ( a recently launched 32-core CPU ) notches up around the 5,500 mark in that Cinebench test , so the new Epyc processor is something like two and a third times faster than that . If this leak is indeed on the money , it purportedly comes from an engineering sample of AMD ’ s 64-core CPU , and that means the finished production chip should run even faster . And that would represent an exciting prospect for those looking for a heavyweight server processor with some serious power packed into its silicon . AMD ’ s incoming Epyc chips are codenamed Rome ( the previous Epyc processors were Naples ) , and should start sampling in limited quantities as we near the end of this year , with a full launch to follow in 2019 .

The Intel Coffee Lake Refresh leaks just keep on coming , and this time we now know a bit more on how the Intel Core i9-9900K will perform in gaming . The Intel Core i9-9900K clocked in with an impressive 10,747 point overall score in 3DMark Time Spy , according to benchmark data spotted by Tum Apisak . That ’ s almost a full 1,000 points higher than the previous 9,862 overall score in 3DMark Time Spy we saw the Intel Core i9-9900K supposedly achieving earlier this July . However , this massive performance bump may have come largely thanks to both the processor and graphics card being overclocked . For this run , the Intel Core i9-9900K was supposedly running with all cores overclocked to 4,802MHz and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti was running at 1,936MHz . Normally , as far as rumors go , Intel ’ s forthcoming 8-core/16-thread processor is said to feature a 5.0GHz single-core boost clock , meanwhile we know the Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti typical runs at a 1,582MHz boost clock . In another run , the Intel Core i9-9900K produced a score of 10,068 points with the CPU running at stock settings and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti overclocked to 2,050MHz . As far as rumors go , this one seems to have a stronger potential for legitimacy to it than previous reports . Rather than being a screenshot or handcrafted performance charts , this information is coming from a well-respected database on that ’ s live on the web . Still , we can ’ t fully believe in this report until the CPUs are announced by Intel itself – and tested by yours truly . Via Wccftech

We ’ ve seen plenty of benchmark results from the Intel Core i7-9700K recently , but now it seems there are leaks on the rest of the Coffee Lake Refresh family . The Intel Core i9-9900K and Core i5-9600K have seen their Geekbench numbers leaked out . As expected , Intel ’ s first mainstream 8-core/16-thread Intel Core i9-9900K processor did the best with 6,248 points in single-core and 33,037 points in multi-core benchmarks . Meanwhile , the more mid-range 6-core/6-thread Intel Core i5-9600K completed the same tests with 6,027 and 23,472 points in single- and multi-core benchmarks , respectively . By comparison , the Intel Core i7-8700K processor only achieved 5,508 single-core and 25,034 multi-core results . So , it seems like even a modest Coffee Lake Refresh CPU will outperform the flagship processor from the previous Coffee Lake generation . Bear in mind that all of these processors were tested on a Gigabyte Aorus Z370 Ultra Gaming 2.0 motherboard , so we may see even better performance from Intel ’ s all but confirmed Z390 platform . Then again , we 're not going to believe in these rumors until the processors are officially announced and we ’ ve done our own benchmarking – two things we hope will happen soon . Via Wccftech
As if the Intel Coffee Lake Refresh leaks were n't widespread enough , the first review of the rumored Intel Core i7-9700K has appeared well ahead of its official announcement . The very first Intel Core i7-9700K review comes by way of El Chapuzas Informatico , and it seems to confirm all the rumors we ’ ve heard thus far . This includes its 14nm architecture , 8-core/8-thread layout and complete lack of hyper-threading , as well as its maximum 4.9GHz boost clock on single-core ( 4.6GHz boost across all cores ) . Read more : HP EliteBook 745 G5 More importantly , the review allegedly contains complete benchmarks that show a disappointingly small improvement in performance over last-generation chips . Tests like Cinebench R15 show the 9700K performing 300 points below the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X and just 50 points ahead of the last generation Intel Core i7-8700K . The rumored Coffee Lake Refresh CPU fares better at gaming benchmarks , like 3DMark Fire Strike and Time Spy , as well as Unigine Heaven 4.0 , but only barely so . In terms of gaming , the 9700K only gains up to 10 frames more than AMD Ryzen 7 2700X and Intel Core i7-8700K in titles like Battlefield 1 and Far Cry 5 . Before we take too much stock into this self-proclaimed first official review , know it 's very easy to Photoshop a screenshot of the CPU-Z interface . It ’ d be child ’ s play to spoof our own screenshot to say we reviewed the Intel Core i9-10700K if we wanted to , and the same goes for the image of the chip . Likewise , there ’ s no way to check the validity of these benchmarks , and they could have been completely made up with random numbers . We ’ re also a bit skeptical because these benchmark results seem antithetical to the impressive performance we ’ ve seen from other Intel Core i7-9700K leaks – regardless , we ’ re skeptical of all benchmark data thus far . Regardless of whether this review is to be trusted , you can be assured we ’ ll have our own review in the near future . Via TechPowerUp

Update : Intel has been in contact with a statement about its CPU supply : “ Customer demand has continued to improve over the course of the year , fuelling growth in every segment of Intel ’ s business and raising our 2018 revenue outlook $ 4.5 billion from our January expectations . We will have supply to meet our announced , full-year revenue outlook and we ’ re working closely with our customers and factories to manage any additional upside . ” Original story follows ... Read more : HP EliteBook 745 G5 It looks like Intel ’ s warning a few months ago that it could struggle to meet demand has come to pass , with certain CPUs rising in price due to their reduced availability . Customers are finding that certain Intel processors are now often out of stock from most retailers , while processors that are in stock have seen price rises . As Tom ’ s Hardware has discovered , the price rises found on a number of online stores have mainly affected low-end processors , with more expensive enthusiast processors less affected . It looks like Intel 's increased focus on the 14nm process , which happened a few months ago , is to blame , with Intel confirming in July that 14nm supply was an issue when trying to meet demand . With the delay of the 10nm Cannon Lake processors until 2019 , this has further placed pressure on its 14nm production lines . Combine that with the recent launches of the 14nm Whiskey Lake and Amber Lake processors , and you have a perfect storm that ’ s impacting 14nm CPU production , causing shortages and price rises . This might benefit Intel ’ s chief rival , AMD , which seems to be unaffected by any such shortages , with plenty of 14nm and 12nm chips hitting the market . People frustrated with trying to get hold of Intel ’ s processors may look at getting an AMD chip , such as the recently-released AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2950X and AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX CPUs . AMD ’ s full-throttled production capacity in the face of Intel ’ s struggles could see a repeat of the end of last year , where AMD ’ s performance was well above expectations .

The tech world is abuzz about a brand new MacBook Air or a reimagining of Apple ’ s MacBook for 2018 ahead of the company ’ s annual iPhone event , when such products have been revealed in the past ... but you might not want to hold your breath for a debut on September 12 . DigiTimes , speaking to anonymous industry sources , reports that Intel ’ s newly-announced , 8th-generation Amber Lake and Whiskey Lake processors are experiencing “ serious shortages and could relatively affect vendors ’ sales . ” Considering how far back Intel must have begun work on these processors to have announced them just a week ago along with a spate of new laptops at IFA 2018 , it ’ s more than likely that the aforementioned new MacBook will rely on one of the Amber Lake ( i.e . new Core M and Y series ) processors . There have been no improvements to Intel ’ s M or Y series processors , which are used exclusively in Apple ’ s current 12-inch MacBook lineup , between when the most current MacBook released in 2017 and now . So , there ’ s little chance that Apple would release a new MacBook with the same processor as before . If Intel truly is having trouble keeping up with demand for the chips , then that could leave Apple with fewer MacBook units than it would want to launch with . Therefore , it ’ s possible that September 12 will not be the day we see this long-rumored Apple laptop , but rather sometime in October or early November , as has been the case for past Mac hardware launches . If you ask us , the more time that Apple has to keep that MacBook in the oven , the better – the competition is absolutely fierce out there these days . Via BGR

Intel Coffee Lake Refresh processors have been spotted overclocking all over the web , but now we ’ re getting a rare glimpse of benchmark data showing how the rumored Intel Core i7-9700K will perform . PCGamesN picked up on the purported 8-core/8-thread processor appearing in the Geekbench database complete with a 6,297 single-core scores and 30,152 multi-core scores . Read more : Intel Core i9-9980XE Comparatively , the last-generation Intel Core i7-8700K processor achieved 5,508 and 25,034 point results in the same respective tests , while the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X performed gallantly with 4,998 single-core and 26,011 multi-core scores . Now we fully expected higher single-core performance simply by way of the 9700K being rumored to have a 200MHz faster boost clock than its Coffee Lake predecessor . However , the significantly improved multi-core performance is unprecedented considering this new processor supposedly won ’ t support hyper-threading and has four fewer threads than the 8700K and eight fewer threads than the 2700X . We originally thought it was odd that one of Intel ’ s flagship processors would lack its trademark hyper-threading feature , but perhaps Team Blue is onto something we don ’ t know about yet . Still , there ’ s no real way to ensure the validity of these scores , so we ’ re going to contain our excitement with bated breath for now . Of course , it wouldn ’ t be a typical week without us seeing yet another Coffee Lake Refresh processor overclocked ahead of its official announcement , and this time it ’ s the 9700K once again . The Intel Core-i7 9700K was supposedly overclocked up to 5.3GHz , which is 400MHz higher than rumored processor ’ s 4.9GHz boost clock speed , by a writer at EXPreview . Though this rumored CPU has been previously spotted overclocking past 5.5GHz across all eight cores , this is still an impressive result given that the chip appears to have only been air cooled with a tower-style heatsink . Unfortunately , there were no benchmark scores to go along with the extreme overclocking , and otherwise the only thing validating this rumor are some of the most blurry and pixelated images we ’ ve ever seen – so we ’ re taking this report with an equally extreme grain of salt .

Intel has come out and clarified that its 10nm processors aren ’ t in trouble – or cancelled altogether , as a recent rumor suggested – but that the firm is making ‘ good progress ’ with these Cannon Lake CPUs . Of course , Cannon Lake has been a long time coming ; it was expected to succeed Skylake way back in 2016 – and volume production of the chips has been pushed back multiple times , the most recent blow being a delay to 2019 . And against that backdrop of disappointment , SemiAccurate reported yesterday that Intel had killed off its 10nm parts , because moving to mass production simply wasn ’ t financially viable , the article claimed . However , in a tweet spotted by Bit-tech , the Intel News account released a statement denying that work on 10nm was being shelved , and that everything was still on schedule in line with the firm ’ s assertions in its last earnings call . Media reports published today that Intel is ending work on the 10nm process are untrue . We are making good progress on 10nm . Yields are improving consistent with the timeline we shared during our last earnings report.October 22 , 2018 In other words , nothing has changed since we last heard about the delay to next year ( and indeed the fact that PCs toting Cannon Lake processors probably won ’ t go on sale until the very end of 2019 ) . Intel ’ s current CPUs are built on a 14nm process , so as you can imagine , the drop to 10nm is a big deal . Bear in mind that a limited number of 10nm processors are out there at the low-end of the market , but mass production of the chips is obviously where Intel needs to be , and where the difficulty lies in perfecting yields .

AMD appears to be trying to poach customers from Intel following the revelation of the latter ’ s new 9th-gen processors and their pricing , with the asking price of the Ryzen 7 2700X being chopped to just $ 294.99 at Amazon over in the US . Now , remember that Intel ’ s incoming Core i9-9900K , which goes on sale October 19 , and is also an eight-core processor with very similar specs on paper – albeit with a somewhat faster boost speed in stock configuration – has a recommended price of $ 488 ( around £370 ) . Read more : HP EliteBook 745 G5 As we noted in our hands on with Intel ’ s Core i9 , the Ryzen 7 2700X looked comparatively great value at $ 329 , and now it has been further dropped by just over 10 % . In short , this makes Intel ’ s chip seem very costly – it ’ s around two-thirds more expensive to be precise – particularly when you remember that AMD ’ s effort also comes bundled with a premium Wraith cooler . So if you want a bargain eight-core ( 16-thread ) chip , AMD ’ s 2700X is certainly a very tempting option at the moment . Sadly , in the UK , the Amazon price hasn ’ t been similarly chopped by 10 % , although you can get the 2700X for £289.99 , which is a tenner cheaper than the recommended price ( which other outlets seem to be sticking to in the main ) , and still represents a great overall value proposition for such a powerful chip . And who knows , when Black Friday rolls around , there will be more deals across all sorts of hardware including processors – and we might just see even lower discounted prices in the UK and US . Fingers crossed . Remember , the Ryzen 7 2700X scored full marks in our review back in April , scooping a ‘ best in class ’ award for its dramatic improvements on the performance front .

Benchmark results for the upcoming Intel Core i5-9600K have apparently leaked , showing how well the new mainstream processor performs under intensive workloads at both stock speeds and when overclocked . The Intel Core i5-9600K is a processor aimed at more mainstream users , rather than enthusiasts , and comes with six cores and six threads , along with 9MB of L3 cache . The leak comes courtesy of a Chinese video streaming website , which showed the new chip being used in an MSI Z390 MEG Godlike motherboard with 16 GB of DDR4 . According to the video , the Intel Core i5-9600K managed a stable frequency of 4.60GHz single core and 4.3 GHz across all cores when running intensive multi-thread workloads . This is very promising results , and should see the Intel Core i5-9600K offer a very good upgrade over its predecessor , the Intel Core i5-8600K . Here are the apparent benchmarks according to the video : Cinebench R15 Stock : 1,034 5.2Ghz overclock : 1,207 CPU-Z Stock : 528.8 ( Single ) , 2,919.1 ( Multi-Thread ) 5.2Ghz overclock : 619 ( Single ) , 3,579.7 ( Multi-Thread ) X264 HD Benchmark Stock : 37.55 fps 5.2Ghz overclock : 43.76 fps The video also apparently shows how well the Intel Core i5-9600K can be overclocked , and again the results are very promising . In the video , the chip is overclocked to 5.2GHz with a voltage of 1.507V . That ’ s a hefty boost over the stock speeds , and it ’ s particularly impressive as the people in the video are using Thermalright Silver Arrow Extreme air cooler . Although that ’ s a high-end air cooler , it potentially shows the overclocking chops of the Intel Core i5-9600K without having to use more intensive cooling methods . Intel has already disclosed that the Intel Core i5-9600K , along with its other 9th generation processors , will have a new STIM ( Soldered Thermal Interface Material ) , however on the video we see temperatures rising above 90c when at full load across all cores . This leak comes ahead of the official Intel Core i5-9600K launch , alongside the rest of the 9th generation , on October 19 . While these results are impressive , as always with leaked benchmarks you should take them with a pinch of salt . We ’ ll be running our own benchmarks on the 9th generation lineup in our upcoming reviews . Via Wccftech

Intel has released a new graphics driver for Windows 10 which improves performance for FIFA 19 . However , the odd thing is the firm has downgraded the audio driver a previous version that could be incompatible with the October 2018 Update . We reported on this particular bugbear a week ago , with the big Windows 10 update causing trouble on some PCs with Intel Skylake ( 6th Generation ) or newer processors and Intel 's Display Audio driver . Read more : Azulle Access3 Mini PC This gremlin was cured in version 10.25.0.10 of the said audio driver , but now Intel ’ s new graphics driver ( version 25.20.100.6326 ) has rolled the audio driver back to the problematic version 10.25.0.9 the company just fixed . Why this would happen is a mystery , in short . As Neowin reports , Intel clarifies that the known issues for the new graphics driver include : “ When upgrading to Windows 10 October 2018 , some installs may fail due to an Intel audio driver . ” Of course , the good news on this front ( sort of ) is that Microsoft halted the Windows 10 October 2018 Update rollout due to a file deletion issue . So nobody will be upgrading to the big update right now . However , if you ’ ve already installed the October 2018 Update , going with this new Intel graphics driver could potentially cause a gremlin to appear . One again remember that the audio driver flaw only affected certain PCs with Intel 6th Generation Skylake or newer processors with Intel UHD Graphics 620 or better . Hopefully , by the time the October 2018 Update resumes this Intel audio driver-related glitch will also have been solved . Another known issue between Intel ’ s new graphics driver and the October 2018 Update is that Amazon Prime video playback can be choppy and/or have corrupted audio if your machine recently came out of hibernation , As for the good stuff the Intel driver brings forth , as mentioned at the outset , it solves a problem with FIFA 19 when running in DirectX 11 . Before the new driver , the issue caused corruption and the incorrect rendering of some in-game graphics . This new Intel driver also added support for a pair of games – Pathfinder : Kingmaker and Battlerite Royale . Meanwhile , if you ’ ve hit any other snags with the latest update for Windows 10 , check out our article on how to fix Windows 10 October 2018 Update problems .

Intel announced its range of 9th Generation Core processors at its Desktop Launch Event 2018 , including the new eight-core Intel Core i7-9700K . This will be the processor that high-end PC builders will want to buy , but how does it compare to its 8th generation predecessor , the Intel Core i7-8700K ? In this article we 'll compare how the two processors stack up against each other , and see if there 's a compelling reason to buy the new i7-9700K over the older , yet still very powerful i7-8700K . The Intel Core i7-8700K launched last year for $ 359 ( about £270 , AU $ 460 ) , which put it directly against AMD ’ s best Ryzen 7 processors including the $ 329 ( £299 , AU $ 469 ) AMD Ryzen 7 2700X . Meanwhile , the Intel Core i7-9700K will cost $ 374 ( around AU $ 530 ) . In the UK , retailers have pitched it at a higher £500 price tag . The price after tax will be more like $ 399 , if you 'll want the newer , and more powerful , i7-9700K . Of course , those looking to build a high-end gaming PC may already be ready to splurge on the best CPU . This is where things get a little confusing , as the Intel Core i7-9700K comes with two extra cores but a lower thread count than the Intel Core i7-8700K . So , the Intel Core i7-9700K comes with eight-cores and eight-threads , 12MB cache and a TDP of 95W . Meanwhile , the Intel Core i7-8700K features six-cores and 12 threads , 12MB cache and a 95W TDP . The Intel Core i7-9700K is also rated with a base clock of 3.6GHz and can boost one its processor cores all the way to 4.9GHz . Comparatively , the Intel Core i7-8700K starts at a tick higher 3.7GHz base frequency , but can ’ t go nearly as fast with its maximum 4.7GHz boost clock . However , it could be in overclocking where the Intel Core i7-9700K will really gain a lead over its predecessor . Thanks to its soldered integrated heat spreader ( IHS ) , the Intel Core i7-9700K should be better at keeping the chip cool , allowing for better overclocks . In theory , this purported gold-plated solder replacing the thermal paste Intel has used in the past will be a much more efficient heat transfer medium . So , should you upgrade from a Intel Core i7-8700K to a Intel Core i7-9700K ? We wo n't be able to give you a definitive answer until we 've properly reviewed the new chip and spent time with it , but on paper at least it looks like the Intel Core i7-9700K is a decent upgrade for a reasonably higher price . It does n't look like it does anything that will make the Intel Core i7-8700K obsolete any time soon , though . That may be good news for Intel Core i7-8700K owners , but disappointing for others .

Intel has just held a launch event where it announced the 9th generation of its Core processors , also known as Intel Coffee Lake Refresh . The event began on October 8 at 10:00 EDT ( 07:00 PST/15:00 BST/0:00 October 9 AEST ) . Of course , we were there , bringing you the latest news as it happened . If you missed the excitement , read on for a blow-by-blow account of what Intel showed off . All times in Eastern Daylight Time ( EDT ) 11:06 - The Intel Core i9-9980XE is 3.0GHz to 4.4GHz while the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX is 3.0GHz to 4.2GHz . So you 're getting faster speeds over Intel 's cores . And now Intel is holding a Q and A session , so we 'll end this live blog FOR REAL this time . Thanks for reading , and look out for our reviews as soon as we get some time with the new processors ! 11:01 - According to Intel , the 18-core Intel Core i9-9980XE does 27 % faster rendering in Maya , up to 108 % faster video editing in premiere and a 13 % faster game build time in Unreal Engine . This is because of ( again , according to Intel ) , Ryzen Threadripper 2nd Generation 's memory latency , as well as Intel being able to produce a much faster processor with higher base/boost clock speeds . 10:59 - However , Intel is claiming that it can do more with fewer cores . According to the presentation `` Performance is the balance of architecture , design and frequency '' . Now , Intel is comparing the 18-core Intel Core i9-9980XE to the 36-thread AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX . 10:55 - Disappointingly , there 's no new Turbo Boost Max Technology , Intel is still going with version 3.0 that lets you push the processor 's two fastest cores . 10:54 - Intel 's new 9th Generation Core-X family includes nine new CPUs . Up to 18-cores , still behind on the AMD Ryzen Treadripper 2nd Gen. Looks like AMD has won the `` most cores '' fight then ! But Intel does n't seem that bothered with fighting them on that front . 10:52 - Here 's some of the presentation Intel is showing us . Enlarge the image to see the details on the new X-Series processors that are coming . 10:51 - Intel is hyping up its Core X CPUs , and how they are `` blazing a trail '' . 10:49 - Intel is now talking about its high-end desktop processors , including the Intel Xeon W-3175X that was mentioned before . 10:45 - Not bad prices . We 're not getting info on performance . All the performance numbers are versus last generation . So you can see 10 % better performance in Encore and 34 % faster video editing in Adobe Premiere . Game-wise you get 10 % more frames per second in Hitman . Nice ! 10:43 - On to prices now : 10:42 - This new generation uses 14nm++ process . For the 8-core chips there are now 33 % more cores than previous generations , and are 400MHz faster across all cores . 10:40 - Intel is now going over its completely new 9th Generation CPUs that include an Core i9 , Core i7 , Core i5 . We 're getting more info here than during the main demonstration . Soldered heatsink is back . No more TIM ( thermal interface material ) . 10:37 - The livestream is over but we 're still here getting a deep dive into Intel 's new CPU lineups . 10:35 - Oh , maybe it 's not over ! The livestream is done , but Intel are now going into more indepth details about the processors and the new desktops that will be running it . Keep this page open while we update you with the stuff INTEL DOES N'T WANT YOU TO SEE ( maybe ) . We 're checking with Intel . 10:33 - And it 's over ! Now we 'll elbow our way to the front of the queue to try out these new CPUs ! Keep an eye out for our hands on reviews on TechRadar soon ! The Intel Core i9-9900K is Intel 's first ever 8-core , 16-thread processor pic.twitter.com/ImJoQhwpVGOctober 8 , 2018 10:32 - They are wrapping up now .

They are playing two games at once on one PC . Crazy ! 10:25 - 9th gen core processors are real ! Fake shock ! But exciting . Testing against the most popular games in the world compared to Intel 's previous CPUs . `` The results are absolutely clear . The Intel Core i9 9900K is the best gaming processor in the world . Period . '' 10:23 - Quite glad that bit 's over . Bit awkward . But ca n't fault Intel 's commitment to esports . 10:22 - The future of gaming seems like esports will continue to dominate . Traditional sports and gaming will continue to `` cross pollinate '' . Technology has also caught up to content creators . 10:21 - We 've talked to Intel a lot about esports . The company is very committed to esports . Looks like that 's not changing any time soon . 10:20 - Fortnite , virtual reality , it 's all kicking off when it comes to gaming , according to Intel and its guests . We agree . It 's never been a better time to be a PC gamer ! 10:17 - Srivatsa now welcoming professional CS : Go gamer , and some another esports player that I am not going to try to spell their `` handle '' correctly . Sorry . Intel 's new Core-X platform is wild . Expect chips with up to 18-cores and 36-threads . Support for up to 68 PCIe lanes and finally a soldered heatsink ! pic.twitter.com/g5G9xFne4eOctober 8 , 2018 10:15 - This is stuff we 've heard before from Intel . How multi-core and multi-thread processors can help developers , and gamers , multi-task intensive tasks , such as gaming and streaming at the same time . `` Seamlessly , with no impact to their gameplay '' according to Srivatsa . 10:13 - Similar to Nvidia 's event earlier this year when it showed off the RTX 2080 graphic card , Intel is showing us how its hardware can help game developers create even more realistic and impressive games . 10:12 - Now we 're getting some demos on how the platform will help creators . 10:10 - Intel X-series offers power for creators no matter what their use case is . `` Our most scalable '' processors , according to Intel . 10:09 - The new Xeon W-3175X will ship this December . 10:07 - Now getting a sample of Tangent Studio 's work . Looks good ! 10:06 - David Hearn is now on the stage talking up how Intel 's hardware helped him and his company ( Tangent Animation ) create 3D animations in Blender . 15:04 - First off showing its 28-core , 64-thread Xeon processor . For professionals . It 's going to be super powerful , and super expensive . Intel is confident it will help power content makers . 10:03 - `` Technology has changed the world , and the PC is at the center of this . '' Srivatsa now listing Intel 's achievements in 2018 . 10:01 - Here we go ! Anand Srivatsa , vice president and general manager in the Client Computing Group takes to the stage . 09:57 - We 've now taken our seats and are waiting for the event to begin . IT 'S ALL SO BLUE . 09:52 - Under ten minutes to go now ! Who 's excited ? OK , processors are n't the sexiest products in the world , but we 've been loving the recent arms race between Intel and AMD , so it will be great to see how Intel responds to AMD 's 2nd generation Ryzen CPUs . There 's also some desktops set up with the new hardware , so we should get a chance to give them a go when the presentation is over . Just waiting for Intel 's Desktop Event 2018 to begin . Hoping to see some 9th generation processors today # Intel pic.twitter.com/ZpM5RKOoyGOctober 8 , 2018 09:38 - Well , this photo above settles the debate about whether or not we 'll be seeing Intel 's 9th gen processors today ! Hopefully today 's event goes into detail on what kind of performance boost we get compared to the 8th generation . 09:33 - Another photo from inside the venue . Intel is clearly proud of its history , as these framed motherboards from various years shows . Expect this event to touch on some of the highlights of Intel 's past . 09:28 - Look where we are ! Just over half an hour until the event kicks off and we find out what Intel has in store for us . Let 's just hope no one at Intel has upgraded to the Windows 10 October 2018 Update and lost the presentation ( too soon ? ) . 09:01 - While Intel has been pretty tight-lipped about what the Desktop Launch Event 2018 is going to be about , there have been plenty of rumors that we 'll see Intel 's 9th generation ( Coffee Lake Refresh ) chips . While we 're waiting for the event to start , check out our roundup of all the news and rumors we 've heard so far about these processors . There has never been a better time to own a desktop PC ! Tune into our livestream on October 8 at 10 am EST : https : //t.co/xRpXo5ySy6 pic.twitter.com/8FSqMidjquOctober 6 , 2018 08:43 - Intel has been hyping up today 's event , which starts in less than an hour and a half , so we 're expecting some big announcements . We 're currently en route to where the event is being held in New York . Fingers crossed for some new desktop processors !
Intel has officially taken the wraps off its new Coffee Lake Refresh ( 9th-generation ) processors , which include the Core i9-9900K , Core i7-9700K , and Core i5-9600K . Obviously any Intel processor launch is major news , but this is a particularly big splash seeing as the Core i9-9900K represents the first mainstream Core i9 offering sporting 8-cores and 16-threads . It has a base clock of 3.6GHz and turbo to 5GHz – yes , it hits 5GHz out of the box – with 16MB of cache , and is priced at $ 529.99 ( around £405 , AU $ 750 ) . Stepping down to the Core i7-9700K , that ’ s also an 8-core processor , but with 8-threads in this case , running with the same base clock of 3.6GHz and turbo to 4.9GHz , plus 12MB of cache . It commands an asking price of $ 399.99 ( around £305 , AU $ 565 ) . And then we have the Core i5-9600K with 6-cores ( 6-threads ) and a base clock of 3.7GHz with turbo to a slightly lesser 4.6GHz ( by the way , all these specs were previously rumored thanks to a leak from Intel itself ) . The i5 spin has 9MB of cache , and in this case the chip is priced at $ 279.99 ( around £215 , AU $ 395 ) . All of these processors have a TDP of 95W ( yes , even the Core i9 model ) , and they support dual-channel DDR4 2,666MHz memory , fitting Intel ’ s ( revised ) LGA 1151 socket and motherboards with the 300-series chipset . They also run with Intel UHD Graphics 630 for integrated graphics . Of course , the proof will be in the pudding when it comes to testing out how fast these chips really are , although previous leaks from 3DMark indicate an impressively speedy Core i9-9900K which easily beat out AMD ’ s Ryzen 7 2700X ( also an 8-core and 16-thread CPU ) – and Intel ’ s chip performed even better when it was overclocked , unsurprisingly . That said , you can currently bag that Ryzen 2700X for $ 330 ( around £255 , AU $ 470 ) online at the time of writing . Admittedly that ’ s on sale , and it normally retails for more like $ 360 ( around £275 , AU $ 510 ) – but that ’ s still a good deal cheaper than where Intel is pitching this first mainstream Core i9 chip ( indeed it ’ s cheaper than the Core i7-9700K ) .

Intel may have more than Coffee Lake Refresh processors in store for us , as a new report suggests the company will also be launching a new series of motherboards and Skylake-X Refresh processors . Intel will supposedly introduce a new Z399 platform to succeed its current high-end desktop X299 chipset , according to PC manufacturer who spoke to PC Builder ’ s Club . The Z399 chipset breaks away from the trend of Intel using an X-designation for its HEDT platform , and it ’ s mostly due to AMD already snapping up the X399 name for its Ryzen Threadripper and Ryzen Threadripper 2nd Generation CPUs . Read more : Intel Core i9-9980XE According to the insider source , Z399 motherboards are already being made to order for SkyLake-X Refresh processors that may launch this October . However , before you get excited about Intel finally introducing its 28-core processor , this long-anticipated chip supposedly won ’ t be coming with this generation . Instead the PC manufacturer says the rumored Z399 platform ’ s LGA 2066 socket is only designed to fit up to a 22-core CPU . We reportedly shouldn ’ t expect Intel 's 28-core processor to appear until the start of 2019 , when it will supposedly be launched as an Intel Cascade Lake-X series chip . Via Wccftech
Microsoft has only just unleashed the October 2018 Update , but the big Windows 10 upgrade has already encountered its first technical hitch , hitting compatibility issues with some Skylake ( 6th-generation ) or newer processors . The issue is with the Intel Display Audio driver for some of those chips , and Microsoft notes that it may result in excessive processor usage , along with reduced battery life ( the latter presumably because of the former , at least in part ) . At any rate , if you ’ ve got a notebook with an affected Intel chip , diminished battery longevity is obviously very bad news . You ’ ll know if this gremlin pertains to your machine if when you attempt to install the October 2018 Update , you get a ‘ What needs your attention ’ notification , which warns that the Intel Display Audio driver causes stability problems and will be disabled . Whatever you do , don ’ t click the Confirm button to go ahead with the installation of the Windows update – because it will fail . Instead , simply close the dialog box and don ’ t attempt the upgrade . Microsoft is moving to block the update being offered to affected machines anyway . As noted previously , Intel has said that this affects some Skylake or newer chips , using versions 10.25.0.3 through to 10.25.0.8 of this particular driver . However , if you have Intel Graphics Driver 24.20.100.6286 or better on your PC , this reportedly already contains the fix for the issue ( as it runs with version 10.25.0.10 of the Intel Display Audio driver ) . So you should be fine if this is the case , and no warning message should pop up . Note that while Microsoft has made the Windows 10 October 2018 Update available to manually grab , the automatic rollout of the upgrade doesn ’ t actually kick off until October 9 , as we ’ ve previously observed . Don ’ t forget that we ’ ve got a full guide on how to download and install the Windows 10 October 2018 Update . Also , if you encounter any other issues , check out our guide on how to fix Windows 10 October 2018 Update problems . Via Wccftech

Coffee Lake Refresh has been the long-rumored code name for Intel ’ s next generation processor for desktops , but we may have just stumbled upon our first official confirmation ( and possible correction ) , thanks to early drivers . While updating our Ultimate Mini Gaming PC over the weekend , we spotted one Intel Graphics Accelerator Driver on Asus ’ s website that claims it will “ improve system stability & support Intel next gen CPU [ s ] . ” Upon downloading the driver update , we opened up a readme file that makes several references to “ 8th Gen Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) processor family ( Code name Kaby Lake Refresh , Coffee Lake , Coffee Lake S Refresh ) . ” Up until now , it was widely expected that this upcoming processor update would be known as simply 'Coffee Lake Refresh , ' as the 'S ' is assumed with today 's Coffee Lake chips . Based on all the leaks , rumors and now official evidence , there seems to be no doubt that Intel ’ s rumored Intel Core i9-9900K , Core i7-9700K and other 9000-series processors will all be part of Coffee Lake Refresh . Of course , that ’ s merely a code name . As with previous chip launches , going forward Intel will only refer to them as 8th Generation processors , just like the original Coffee Lake 8000-series , which is annoying . But , it could be worse , as the mobile 8th generation CPU family includes Kaby Lake Refresh , Coffee Lake , Whisky Lake and Amber Lake chips all at the same time with very similar model names . We ’ re getting awfully close to Intel Coffee Lake Refresh ’ s rumored October launch . From everything we ’ ve gathered , it seems like Team Blue will be introducing its fastest series of processors yet featuring fancy new packaging , soldered heat spreaders for fantastic overclocking and significantly higher gaming performance . We 've contacted Asus and Intel for comment on this story , and will update with a response should we receive one .

Just when we thought there weren ’ t any more Coffee Lake Refresh details to leak , Amazon reportedly goes and leaks the price and packaging for Intel ’ s upcoming flagship processor . Thanks to an accidentally posted Amazon listing for the Intel Core i9-9900K spotted by Momomo_Us , we now know the processor won ’ t come in any ordinary box , but a transparent dodecahedron . If this 12-sided die-shaped packaging is the real deal , it would seem Intel aims to one-up AMD ’ s packaging game , which has introduced some outstanding boxes for Ryzen Threadripper 1st and 2nd Generation CPUs . We 're not terribly convinced by the screenshot , simply because it looks like a blown-up dodecahedron die with a bit of Intel Core i9 badging pasted onto it . A 12-sided shape also seems like a curious choice when the Intel Core i9-9900K is rumored to feature 8-cores and 16-threads . As Wccftech notes , a hexadecagon or octahedron would have better reflected the product . ☕️®️🎁https : //t.co/HkemyWeWsj⁉️October 1 , 2018 Casing aside , the Amazon listing also suggests the Intel Core i9-9900K will cost $ 582 ( about £450 , AU $ 810 ) . That ’ s quite a bit higher than the $ 480 ( about £370 , AU $ 660 ) price for the same chip we saw leaked by Silicon Lottery , which came alongside a rumored $ 370 ( about £280 , AU $ 510 ) price for the Intel Core i7-9700K . Comparatively , the most expensive Intel Coffee Lake processors are the $ 359 ( £389 , AU $ 524 ) Intel Core i7-8700K and $ 425 ( £419 , AU $ 629 ) Intel Core i7-8086K . Via Tom ’ s Hardware

Intel is gearing up for an Architecture Day to talk all about its next-generation processor architectures . The chipmaker has reportedly been sending out physical invites pointing to an Intel Architecture Day that will land on Tuesday , December 11 according to HotHardware . The event will be purportedly broken out into a morning session about Intel ’ s “ Architecture Strategy ” followed by afternoon breakout sessions on “ Advanced Client and Data Centric Architectures and Technologies . ” Out of all of this we ’ re most interested in the talks about Intel ’ s Architectural Strategy and how the company plans to move forward after the introduction of 9th Generation processors . We ’ re hoping to get some answers about the brand ’ s long-awaited Cannon Lake 10nm CPUs . If recent rumors are true about a new 10-core Comet Lake CPU , it ’ ll also be interesting to see how Team Blue justifies creating yet another 14nm chip . Of course , our biggest question is whether Intel will touch on the development of its new discrete graphics card . For the most part , Intel has been sending mixed messages about whether GPUs will be even be part of the discussion . We greatly appreciate the excitement and interest in Intel Graphics . Keep sending us questions and input . We are listening . Re the buzz we are hearing about an event in December , here is the response by @ Rajaontheedge . https : //t.co/DMvsBgNTPCNovember 28 , 2018 Raja Koduri , Intel ’ s recently acquired Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Systems and Graphics Architect team , has only said Intel ’ s Architecture Day isn ’ t dGPU day . Meanwhile , another tweet from Intel ’ s Graphics division has said that they ’ re working on a session to answer reader questions from HotHardware . We are in a working session right now answering the questions that have come in from @ HotHardware . Stay tuned ... November 28 , 2018 Intel has yet to confirm anything specifically on the agenda of its Architecture Day , so we ’ ll have to sit tight until next month . Of course , you can expect us to report on any hot new developments come December 11 .
Intel has released new Universal Windows Driver ( UWD ) graphics drivers for Windows 10 – also known as Windows Modern drivers – with some nifty features including support for a couple of new games , and further support for the automatic tuning of game settings for a number of older titles . This is the first such driver to be delivered by Intel , and the fact that this is labelled a universal driver simply means that it works across all device types , similar to how universal apps run across all devices . Read more : Teclast F7 Plus laptop The drivers are version v25.20.100.6444 , and work with Intel ’ s integrated graphics solutions on Windows 10 ( 64-bit ) machines running the Fall Creators Update or newer . Support has been added for two new games : Farming Simulator 2019 ( which was unleashed last week ) , and Artifact , Valve ’ s new card game ( pictured above ) which puts a different spin on the genre compared to Hearthstone , and was only released yesterday . These Windows Modern graphics drivers also tweak Intel ’ s Graphics Control Panel which facilitates automatically tuning game settings on Skylake ( 6th-generation ) or newer Intel processors ( including the latest 8th-gen models with Radeon RX Vega M Graphics ) . A new ‘ rescan ’ button has been added to the control panel which , as the name suggests , scans for newly installed games ( without having to reboot your PC ) . Plus support has been added for tuning a number of new games , namely the following : The new graphics driver comes in the form of a self-installing EXE which you can grab directly from Intel here . Note that if you install this UWD package , it isn ’ t backwards compatible with previous graphics drivers . In other words , if you decide you don ’ t like this new driver , and want to revert to a previous legacy version , you must fully uninstall the UWD driver from Windows Apps and Features , and make sure you reboot your machine , before proceeding to install the older driver . If you don ’ t do this , you risk what Intel describes as “ minor to major system instability ” , so do bear that in mind . Via MS Power User

With Coffee Lake Refresh , Intel introduced its first mainstream octa-core processor and the company may well soon jump to a deca-core CPU as well . Intel is rumored to be working on a new 10-core , 20-thread CPU codenamed Comet Lake according to a rumor posted on a Taiwanese forum . The post also suggests the chip will be based on yet another iteration of Intel ’ s 14nm process . If the rumors are true , this will be the first time Intel has outpaced AMD in the CPU core war in a very long time . The move would also make sense given that AMD is poised to launch new 7nm Zen 2 chips at CES 2019 . The current 8-core , 16-thread Intel Core i9-9900K has already proved to be a performance beast . We ’ ve even labeled it as a high-end desktop processor killer as the Core i9 chip beats AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2nd Generation CPUs in multiple benchmark tests while costing 25-50 % less . However , with the Intel Core i9-9900K already priced at an exorbitant $ 579 ( £599 / AU $ 859 ) , we can only imagine that this rumored 10-core processor will cost in excess of $ 700 ( about £550 or AU $ 970 ) . The current rumors are wafer thin , and with no source other than an anonymous forum poster , we wouldn ’ t put much stock in anything just yet . Of course , we ’ ll be the lookout for any new developments in this area .

Lenovo has revealed the existence of 9th-generation mobile processors from Intel on one of its laptop ’ s product datasheets , potentially indicating that these fresh CPUs could be with us soon . The power-sipping processors – designed to be undemanding for portables , having low-power needs , and indeed low cooling requirements – will apparently arrive in three flavors : Core i7-9550U , Core i5-9250U , and Core i3-9130U . That ’ s according to the spec details of Lenovo ’ s IdeaPad S530 13-inch convertible , but sadly no further information is provided on the processors such as the clock speed or core count . What is interesting , however , is that these 9th-gen CPUs are listed as options directly alongside 8th-gen offerings – essentially the parts that they replace . Naturally , the new chips will doubtless be faster , but they will be built on the same 14nm++ process , so there may not be that much of a difference to the 8th-generation processors . As Wccftech , which spotted this development , notes , the Core i3 will doubtless be a dual-core CPU , with the others being quad-core products . Exactly what clock speeds they will run at is anyone ’ s guess , but we can obviously hope for slightly faster speeds than with the current line-up . As mentioned , the appearance of these processors on a datasheet likely means that they are on the near horizon , unless Lenovo simply made a mistake with the spec details ( although that would seem very unlikely ) . If they are imminent , we will likely see more in the way of leaks soon , which will probably clarify the kind of performance we can expect from these 9th-gen mobile CPUs .

Despite the rollout of Windows 10 ’ s October 2018 Update resuming last week – following the resolution of some major problems – it seems that Intel drivers are still causing issues with the upgrade , with Microsoft now blocking the update from some PCs thanks to a fresh bugbear . Microsoft has previously fixed problems with bugs in Intel drivers ( indeed one remedy was issued last month ) , but it seems that the gremlins persist , as a new post on the company ’ s support forum makes clear . Read more : Mii Mini PC In reply to a user complaining about no longer getting sound from the monitor connected to their PC after upgrading to the October 2018 Update , a Microsoft moderator observes that Intel ‘ inadvertently ’ released versions of its display driver which “ accidentally turned on unsupported features in Windows ” . The moderator notes : “ After updating to Windows 10 , version 1809 [ October 2018 Update ] , audio playback from a monitor or television connected to a PC via HDMI , USB-C or DisplayPort may not function correctly on devices with these drivers . ” As a result , Microsoft is now blocking devices which are running the drivers in question – namely versions 24.20.100.6344 or 24.20.100.6345 . The moderator concludes : “ We are working with Intel to expire these display drivers and provide a resolution in an upcoming release . ” So currently , you shouldn ’ t be able to install the update on an affected PC ( i.e . it should be blocked ) . However , to be safe , if you want to double-check the version of your Intel display drivers , you can do so quite easily . Simply head to Device Manager ( just type that into the search/Cortana box , next to the Start button ) , then click on Display Adapters , right click on Intel HD Graphics , select Properties , and finally click the Driver tab , where the driver version number is listed . If it does happen to be one of the above mentioned versions , obviously you don ’ t want to proceed with the installation of the October 2018 Update ( although you should be blocked from doing so anyway , if Microsoft has done its job policing the rollout ) . If you ’ ve run into any trouble with the latest update for Windows 10 , be sure to check out our guide on how to fix Windows 10 October 2018 Update problems . Note that another issue emerged recently which pertains to those who still use Windows Media Player . Via Wccftech

In an effort to make it easier to add intelligence to smart home gadgets and other network edge devices , Intel has launched the Neural Compute Stick 2 ( NCS2 ) ahead of its first AI developers conference in Beijing . Edge devices generally refer to any piece of hardware responsible for controlling the flow of data between the boundaries of two networks . In addition to routers , switches and gateways , they also include IoT devices such as smart doorbell cameras , smart medical devices , industrial robots and self-guided camera drones . Since Intel 's NCS2 is a self-contained neural network on a thumb drive , it will make developing these devices much easier and faster since the onboard Movidius Myriad X vision processing unit ( VPU ) can provide the processing power needed to train them . Now developers will be able to use a laptop or any system that can run Linux to create AI algorithms and computer vision systems locally without the internet . The only requirements are that their system is running a Linux-based OS and that it has a USB 3.0 port to plug in the NCS2 . Intel 's new NCS2 is apparently eight times faster than its predecessor and the chipmaker has provided a handful of developers with the new device for testing . So far they have developed a variety of useful applications including Clean Water AI which uses machine vision and a microscope to detect harmful bacteria in water , BlueScan AI which scans a patient 's skin for signs of melanoma and ASL Classification which can translate American Sign Language into text in real-time . The NCS2 is available directly through Intel for just $ 100 and multiple sticks can even be used simultaneously for more demanding tasks . The device is not only available to researchers but also to the general public so anyone can begin adding intelligence to their IoT or edge devices . Via Engadget

Intel has revealed it is bringing forward the launch of its 5G modem . The hardware giant has announced the XMM 8160 5G multimode modem , which will be ready six months earlier than initially thought , as it faces increased competition to be the power behind the next-generation networks . The modem will allow manufacturers of PCs , smartphones and tablets to get their devices ready for 5G ahead of the expected 2020 worldwide launch . Intel says it will support download speeds of up to 6GBps - enough to download a full HD movie in the blink of an eye . The modem will also be backwards compatible with LTE and earlier generations of mobile connectivity such as 4G , 3G and 2G , meaning new devices wo n't need multiple chipsets taking up battery power and space . Intel says that the new release will also support millimetre-wave ( mmWave ) spectrum and frequencies between 600MHz and 6GHz to support carriers worldwide , with Intel already signed up to work with Nokia and Ericsson for their 5G deployment . “ Intel ’ s new XMM 8160 5G modem provides the ideal solution to support large volumes for scaling across multiple device categories to coincide with broad 5G deployments , '' said Dr. Cormac Conroy , Intel corporate vice president and general manager of the Communication and Devices Group . `` We are seeing great demand for the advanced feature set of the XMM 8160 , such that we made a strategic decision to pull in the launch of this modem by half a year to deliver a leading 5G solution . ” Intel is now hoping the initial wave of devices with the XMM 8160 modem will appear in the first half of 2020 , around the generally anticipated expectation , but sooner than some predictions . The news comes shortly after Qualcomm revealed it had started sending out 5G-ready modems to its smartphone manufacturer partners . The company 's X50 modem will be included within its next Snapdragon chip , despite Qualcomm not expecting 5G-ready smartpones to be launched until next year .

For most people , the best processors are going to be the ones that pack in a good deal of performance while keeping the price low . While they sound good in practice , most people don ’ t need an 8-core , 16-thread Intel Core i9-9900K . Instead , most people will get more than enough out of something like the Intel Core i5-8400 . Now , while this processor won ’ t be able to absolutely plow through extremely processor-intensive tasks , like 4K media creation , it ’ s going to be reliable for anyone that just wants an affordable CPU for the best PC games . At just $ 199 ( £229 , AU $ 329 ) , the Intel Core i5-8400 is one of the best bang-for-your-buck processors you can buy today . You ’ re going to be able to handle most everyday desktop tasks , while still having enough horsepower to do the occasional video editing or Photoshop work . We promise , this processor is going to be one to look out for on Black Friday and Cyber Monday . The Intel Core i5-8400 is a hexa-core processor without hyper-threading , with a base clock speed of 2.8GHz and can boost up to 4.0GHz . The lack of hyper-threading might sound bad , but most people will never really need more than six threads for day-to-day use , anyways . And , while the i5-8400 isn ’ t unlocked , it still can ’ t be overclocked , so this means there ’ s no reason to go with an expensive motherboard . Instead , you can save a ton of money by buying a H370 , or even a B360 , board that lacks some high-end features and overclocking functionality , but makes up for it with a lower price tag . This makes the Intel Core i5-8400 a great processor for anyone looking to build one of the best gaming PCs on a budget . The Intel Core i5-8400 might seem super affordable at just $ 199 ( £229 , AU $ 329 ) , but it ’ s not without competition . AMD is in a much better space than it was a few years ago , and with Ryzen processors , like the Ryzen 5 2600 , at just $ 159 ( £169 , AU $ 259 ) with six cores and 12 threads , the value doesn ’ t seem quite as good . However , one thing to keep in mind here is just what you ’ re going to use your prospective system for . If you ’ re trying to build a respectable gaming PC , you ’ re going to want to go with the Intel Core i5-8400 , as Intel ’ s chips traditionally have better instructions per clock ( or IPC ) . This translates directly into better single-threaded performance , which is exactly what you need for gaming . The Ryzen chip , though , will be better if you plan to do a lot of streaming . Still , we ’ re sure that there are going to be plenty of Black Friday PC component deals out there , and because the Intel Core i5-8400 is a last-gen chip , you ’ re going to be able to find a ton of deals out there .

As you may already know having arrived at this website , PC gaming has been enjoying a sort of renaissance in recent years , spearheaded in part by component makers like Intel . However , the PC gaming scene is almost all about the high end – so , what about the entry level ? That ’ s why we ’ re looking at the Intel Core i3-8100 processor , a year-old , entry-grade desktop CPU that we anticipate will enjoy some seriously slashed prices this coming Black Friday and Cyber Monday . The Core i3-8100 currently calls for $ 129 ( £154 ) at most retailers at the time of writing , and as such is very much a beginners ’ processor or one for relatively low-power applications . So , is this the processor for you to look out for this coming Black Friday ? As we ’ ve said , the Core i3-8100 is an entry-level processor in Intel ’ s 8th generation ( Coffee Lake ) , which is the case for basically all Core i3 processors from Intel . As such , this is a quad-core processor without hyper-threading ( i.e . cores handling two tasks at once ) built on Intel ’ s well-established 14-nanometer process . The processor is clocked at a 3.6GHz frequency – about standard for desktop processors – but , being an entry-grade processor , it does not support Intel ’ s Turbo Boost technology . This allows processors that support it to be boosted beyond their base clock speeds . A plus is that the chip runs on Intel ’ s HD Graphics 630 subsystem , which is plenty robust for streaming movies up to 4K resolution and run casual PC games . The chip also supports plenty of the latest graphics standards , like OpenGL 4.5 and DirectX 12 . Finally , the Core i3-8100 supports up to 64GB of memory on the DDR4 standard at speeds up to 2,400MHz via two slots , and is rated at 65 watts of TDP – thermal design power , or how much of your PC power supply ’ s available wattage will be used . Again , the Intel Core i3-8100 generally goes for $ 129 ( £154 ) , but so do processors from Intel ’ s biggest rival : AMD . Specifically , the Ryzen 3 2200G is much cheaper at $ 99 ( £89 ) and offers arguably stronger graphics performance with AMD ’ s Vega graphics processing cores . This processor is a tiny bit slower than the Intel chip at 3.5GHz , but can be boosted beyond Intel ’ s at 3.7GHz . However , this AMD processor is completely open for ad-hoc overclocking ( pushing a processor past its listed frequency limit ) , if you ’ ve got the chops for it . Finally , the chip is rated at the very same TDP as the Intel option , so your choice is basically boiled down to preference . AMD processors generally tend to be more open to tweaking but a bit more esoteric in the software that manages them , while Intel processors tend to be more locked down but are generally more plug-and-play in terms of installation and what tuning options are available . For an entry-level processor , the Intel Core i3-8100 should serve you just fine , and can even be used in gaming PC applications when paired with a dedicated graphics card . Just don ’ t expect the best mileage in the few PC games that rely on CPU performance . If you want more from your processor for less , and are prepared to work for it , then go for the AMD option .

Intel has just released two new processors from the Xeon lineup , both built for the data centre business . The two chips in question are the 48-core Cascade Lake Advanced Performance ( AP ) , and the single-socket E-2100 . Details on the new hardware is pretty scarce , but Intel has said that the Cascade Lake AP is a top-tier 14nm device ; either single or dual-socket processors with up to 48 cores and 12 DDR4 channels per package . It will be available for purchase in the first half of 2019 , and Intel will provide more details at the Supercomputing 2018 conference , taking place next week in Texas . The E-2100 , on the other hand , is a 14nm chip designed for workstations and lightweight servers . It runs up to 4.7GHz and can carry up to six CPU cores . It supports up to 64GB of DDR4 2666MHz RAM , with 128GB support coming in a Q1 2019 BIOS update . These chips are now available to buy . Intel says these processors are the best performers you can find for HPC , AI and IaaS workloads . They offer the most memory channels , consequently access to the highest memory bandwidth , compared to any other data centre processor . Intel is also expected to release the Xeon Cascade Lake SP series soon .

Some of Intel 's most popular chips have been hit by a major security flaw , researchers have claimed . This vulnerability , named PortSmash , has been discovered by a team of academics from Tampere University of Technology in Finland and Technical University of Havana Cuba . PortSmash is impacting some of Intel 's most well-known processors , including the Kaby Lake and Skylake units found in many laptops on the market today , and could potentially allow attackers to leak encrypted data from the CPU ’ s internal processes . Specifically , PortSmash targets a flaw in Intel 's hyperthreading technology , which cuts down on the time needed for a device to carry out high-end computing tasks . The researchers where able to exploit a leak in the hyperthreading system to access secure private keys from servers running Skylake and Kaby Lake processors by tracking specific computing processes in order to deduce the key . The flaw affects both servers and PCs , the researchers said , although the former is more at risk , which could prove dangerous for cloud providers who offer infrastructure-as-a-service ( IaaS ) platforms , as servers , storage and networking hardware could be targeted in a single shot . Intel has responded to the report , noting that it expects that the threat it `` is not unique '' to its platforms alone . `` Protecting our customers ’ data and ensuring the security of our products is a top priority for Intel and we will continue to work with customers , partners and researchers to understand and mitigate any vulnerabilities that are identified , '' the company added .

You can ’ t avoid the fact that 2018 was simply a bizarre year for PC components overall – especially when it comes to the best processors . Intel spent the whole year churning out microarchitecture after microarchitecture , in an attempt to prevent AMD from taking too much market share . But , throughout the myriad products Intel released this year , we were left wondering if there was something missing . So , we ’ re going to dive into everything Intel achieved over the last year , creating a sort of report card on how the tech giant handled 2018 . Intel didn ’ t exactly start 2018 off on the right foot – a white paper from Google Project Zero revealed the Spectre and Meltdown exploits that made 90 % of Intel processors vulnerable to attack . Intel immediately responded , saying it would fix the exploits . However , there was a ton of confusion out there related to these fixes . Initially , Intel suggested that these fixes would impact stability and performance by up to 30 % , which it later redacted , saying that the slowdown would be ‘ workload-related ’ , and that most users wouldn ’ t notice any change . And , eventually the patches made their way through Windows Update , but not everyone got a happily ever after . In April , Intel said that certain older processors wouldn ’ t be getting the update , namely the Intel Core i7 900 series , due to issues with the microarchitecture itself . It also cited the fact that most of these older processors weren ’ t being serviced anyway . Luckily , if you buy a newer Intel Coffee Lake Refresh processor you have nothing to worry about . In a move that threw us all for a loop , Intel teamed up with AMD earlier in the year to produce 8th-generation Kaby Lake processors for laptops with AMD Vega graphics . Especially in a year when Intel has been plotting its own GPUs , this team up with its biggest rival kind of came out of nowhere . But , you know what ? It paid off . These Kaby Lake G processors provided awesome performance without some of the pitfalls that dedicated graphics experience . Laptops like the Dell XPS 15 2-in-1 showed great performance , not just in professional workloads , but even in gaming . That ’ s right , these laptop CPUs enabled a pretty decent gaming experience on laptops that were thin , light and convertible . Of course , Intel doesn ’ t just make chunks of silicon , it also makes full-fledged computers occasionally . And , the Intel Hades Canyon NUC , beyond having an awesome name , is genuinely one of the best gaming PCs you can get – as long as you ’ re looking for a very tiny machine . Now , while this tiny PC doesn ’ t come with RAM , storage or an OS – you ’ ll have to supply all that on your own , you are paying just $ 799 ( £743 , AU $ 1,099 ) for a pretty powerful little machine . It packs one of those Kaby Lake G processors we just talked about , which means it can provide GTX 1060-level performance for a fraction of the price of a similarly specced gaming laptop . And , because it ’ s a barebones system , you can upgrade it however you want . Well , barring the GPU and CPU , of course – at least it has ThunderBolt 3 for external graphics . Back at Computex 2018 , we were sure we ’ d get some new processors from either Intel or AMD . And , while both manufacturers teased some HEDT chips , we just got some vague glimpses . But , the chip Intel teased was absolutely insane . We ’ re talking a 28-core , 56-thread behemoth that was overclocked to 5.0GHz across all cores . Turns out that it was overclocked to high heaven using some exotic cooling methods , but it was still impressive anyways . Turns out that it wasn ’ t a consumer chip at all , but instead the Intel Xeon W-3175X workstation chip . This chip isn ’ t quite out yet , but it ’ s around the corner and is rumored to launch it at a whopping $ 4,000 ( £4,000 , about AU $ 5,600 ) price tag . Still , dreaming about such an insane consumer processor was fun while it lasted . Intel also used the event to introduce a special anniversary processor in the form of the Intel Core i7-8086K to commemorate the original 8086 CPU that released 40 years ago . Coffee Lake was already a massive success , thanks to the awesome desktop performance it offered , but when Intel brought Coffee Lake H-series processors for laptops , the performance was off the charts . Coffee Lake H-series brought Intel ’ s 6-core 12-thread mobile processors to laptops for the first time , including the overwhelmingly powerful Intel Core i9-8950HK , found in even the thinnest workstation-class laptops like the MacBook Pro 15-inch . Where these processors really shined , however , was in the best gaming laptops . Devices like the Razer Blade 15 and MSI GS65 Stealth were able to stay thin , light and aesthetic while providing nearly desktop-class performance . However , some manufacturers took that thin , light and powerful concept a little too far . We already mentioned the 15-inch MacBook Pro , but when that thing launched back in July , there was an uproar about its tendency to thermal throttle almost immediately . This problem was patched out by Apple almost immediately – but it still runs dangerously hot . The Core i9-8950HK offers fantastic performance , but it basically requires a heavy duty laptop to reach its full potential . But , the rest of the Intel Coffee Lake H-series mobile processors don ’ t have the same problem . Intel has never been the easiest manufacturer to follow , but it seems like in 2018 , there was just a deluge of different microarchitectures , all of which named after some fictional lake . Beyond the ever-elusive Cannon Lake , we got Whiskey Lake , Cascade Lake , Amber Lake and Coffee Lake Refresh . That ’ s not even mentioning the non-lake microarchitectures like the HEDT-focused Basin Falls Refresh . Most of the year ended up being a guessing game , trying to pin rumored silicon to the lake it belonged to . And , with Cannon Lake and Sunny Cove already rumored for 2019 , it looks like the same shotgun approach is going to repeat itself next year . After months of speculation and false leads , Intel finally released its 9th-generation Coffee Lake Refresh consumer and Basin Falls Refresh HEDT chips . Basin Falls Refresh might not have been all that exciting , but the level of performance offered by Coffee Lake Refresh is worth a mention . The Intel Core i9-9900K , by itself , was worth all the headaches – a 8-core , 16-thread CPU that absolutely demolished the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X – along with many Threadripper 2nd Generation chips . You see , it wasn ’ t just the core counts that matter here – it ’ s the clock speeds . This consumer chip is able to boost up to 5GHz – and that ’ s before overclocking . Less than a month later , Intel would also release the new Intel Core i9-9980XE to reclaim the high-end desktop processor crown . 2018 was a year of reactions and delays from Intel , as it desperately fought to maintain its place in the market , and basically lost . However , don ’ t think for a second that Intel is down for the count . After years of delaying its 10nm Cannon Lake chips , there are already rumors that Intel is going to release Sunny Cove next year , which is … well , it ’ s another 10nm microarchitecture . We should see increased performance and efficiency with this shrink in die size , but with AMD getting ready to launch 7nm Ryzen 3 processors in 2019 , the competition is only going to get more heated from here . What should be particularly interesting , however , is Intel ’ s GPUs . Intel graphics cards have been lurking in the shadows for a while now . We ’ re not sure what these graphics cards will be capable , and we likely won ’ t see them actually materialize in 2019 . But , if its Gen11 integrated graphics are any indication , we ’ re going to brace ourselves for a late entry in the Nvidia vs AMD GPU war .

Remember the hugely powerful 28-core processor Intel demonstrated at Computex earlier this year ? Well , the launch of Intel ’ s Xeon W-3175X is imminent , and online retailers have already listed the CPU , indicating that the price will sit around the $ 4,000 ( about AU $ 5,600 ) or £4,000 mark . You weren ’ t expecting this particular piece of silicon to be cheap , were you ? We certainly weren ’ t , and past speculation pointed to more like a $ 10,000 ( about £8,000 , AU $ 14,000 ) price tag . So it seems that the Xeon W-3175X will be a little more attainable than previously thought . Although still extremely expensive , this is certainly a chip that can feasibly be slotted into a very high-end workstation PC , rather than purely being an enterprise or data center affair . All this is assuming that the retailers in question have the correct price in these early product listings , but as Wccftech spotted , they seem to be pretty much in agreement that it will be around the four grand mark . Kikatek has the Xeon W-3175X at $ 4,570 ( about AU $ 6,400 ) or £4,050 , with others pitching it at around the same level , or a few hundred bucks cheaper . Remember that for the money you get a mighty 28 cores , but more to the point , these cores have a base clock of 3.1GHz , with ( single-core ) Turbo to 4.3GHz out of the box , and this Xeon can be overclocked . Indeed , on the latter score , the Intel demo of the CPU at Computex showed this processor clocked up to 5GHz , which makes for an incredible powerhouse of a chip when you consider the amount of cores on tap . Granted , Intel did use a ridiculous industrial-strength cooling system to achieve this , but the point is any overclocker should be able to get good mileage out of the W-3175X . The CPU is expected to be launched by Intel before the year is out , so with any luck , and given the fact that pricing is now online , we will see it pitch up in the next couple of weeks .

It feels like it was just yesterday that Intel announced three new CPU families for its 9th Generation processors , and now the chipmaker is already talking about its next-generation 10nm microarchitecture . Meet Sunny Cove , Intel ’ s next-generation 10nm CPU microarchitecture that will serve the basis of the company ‘ s new line of server ( Xeon series ) and client ( Core series ) CPUs due to arrive in the second half of 2019 . As you might expect , Intel ’ s new microarchitecture promises the usual increases in performance per clock and power efficiency ; however , Team Blue also plans to introduce new features to accelerate special purpose computing tasks , like AI and cryptography . Sunny Cove will specifically have algorithms to reduce latency , while the enhanced microarchitecture will enable more computing operations to be executed in parallel . This should all translate into snappier performance from Intel ’ s next-gen chips as well as better multi-core performance . On the data-centric side , Intel claims Sunny Cove will feature larger key buffers and memory caches to optimize workloads . While most of this boost in cryptography performance won ’ t matter to most consumers , these improvements should lead to faster file compression and decompression across the board on all Sunny Cove CPUs . Intel even showed off a demo where a Sunny Cove CPU was able to perform a 7-Zip encode using AES-256 75 % faster than an equivalent current Intel CPU . Of course , there was also the caveat of Intel using a recompiled version of 7-Zip designed to take advantage of Sunny Cove 's instructions . Unfortunately , there are still many more unanswered questions . Intel didn ’ t disclose any hard figures on what we can expect in terms of ‘ frequency increases ’ or talk about how many cores this microarchitecture will support . We ’ re sure to hear more about going into next year though . The other big highlight for processors to come out of Intel ’ s Architecture Day was a new 3D packaging process that could revolutionize CPUs . Intel demonstrated a new 3D packaging technology called 'Foveros ' that essentially allows Intel to stack graphics and even AI processors onto its CPUs . For the most part , Intel ’ s processors up to this point utilized either monolithic or 2D integration packaging . The former makes up the bulk of Intel ’ s processors , in which the CPU core , integrated memory , I/O and graphics are all integrated into a single die . Intel recently introduced 2D integration with its Kaby Lake G processors , which essentially conjoins Intel CPU cores with discrete-class AMD graphics . Although the two separate components are built into a single package , they are only connected through the use of Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge that enables high-speed communication . Foveros is essentially an evolution of this 2D integration , in which other components can be stacked on top of each other in a form of logic-on-logic integration . Whereas Intel 's previous EMIB technology utilized silicon bridges , Foveros introduces thousands of `` microbumps '' to create direct face-to-face connections between the stacked parts . Intel ’ s first example of a Foveros product in action combines a high-performance 10nm compute-stacked chiplet with a low-power 22FFL base die . According to Intel , this specific combination will allow small form factor devices to deliver both performance and power efficiency at the same time . This technology most immediately will enable greater flexibility and potentially lead to new form factors . For example , the lack of memory and I/O has been a pain point of increasingly thin Ultrabooks , but this 3D packaging process may solve the problem . Instead of having to squeeze I/O , SRAM and power delivery circuits into a small flat plane , they could be all fabricated into the base die of a CPU with a full-sized high-performance logic chiplet stacked on top . Ultimately , consider this Intel 's method of keeping up with Moore 's Law short of shrinking its die size further , which it 's still hard at work on .
This probably isn ’ t the discrete Intel GPU news you were hoping for , but the company ’ s new Gen11 integrated graphics are impressive nonetheless . Intel unveiled its new Gen11 integrated graphics at its Architecture Day event , and it has finally broken the 1 teraflops barrier – all thanks to its 64 enhanced execution units ( EU ) . If you weren ’ t keeping count , Intel 's previous Gen9 graphics only featured 24 EUs , so this is a more than double increase . Intel says users can expect double the computing performance-per-clock compared to Intel Gen9 graphics . To that end , gaming on just integrated graphics should appear more realistic , especially when Gen11 will also introduce Intel Adaptive Sync technology to smooth frame rates for gaming – following in the footsteps of AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync . Intel also plans to roll out advanced media encoders and decoders with Gen11 graphics to support 4K video streams and 8K content creation . We won ’ t have to wait long for Gen11 integrated graphics to come out , as Intel plans to first introduce them in 10nm-based processors beginning in 2019 . At Architecture Day , Intel also reaffirmed its plans to introduce a discrete graphics processor by 2020 .

While we ’ ve all been waiting for the first 7-nanometer ( nm ) processors for laptops to come from Intel and AMD for years , Qualcomm swooped in to win first place with the Snapdragon 8cx . It ’ s not only the first 7nm processor for laptops , but the chip is also built on an entirely different architecture supplied by ARM , the leading smartphone processor manufacturer . Now that Qualcomm is first out of the gate with a 7nm processor for laptops , where does that leave its incumbent competition , AMD and Intel ? Now , it ’ s a matter of determining the silver and bronze medal winners . Well , let ’ s just say one of those two is way , way closer to second place than the other , shall we ? The Red Team , as its known , is essentially on the cusp of revealing its 7nm processors , and is slated to pull back the curtain on them during CES 2019 – mere weeks away at the time of writing . This is official information , as AMD itself teased the announcement to come during company president and CEO Lisa Su ’ s keynote . Furthermore , AMD isn ’ t just going to show off 7nm Ryzen processors built on its 7nm Zen 2 transistor architecture , but also plans to debut 7nm Vega graphics cards . With this announcement , AMD claims it will “ catapult computing , gaming , and visualization technologies forward with the world ’ s first 7nm high-performance CPUs and GPUs . ” This will not only see AMD meet face-to-face with Qualcomm in the compute world , but also surpass Nvidia ’ s first 12nm architecture for graphics , Turing . As for Intel , well , that ’ s another story . Now it ’ s time to bring out the violins for the Blue Team . Intel has experienced great challenges in bringing its transistor manufacturing process down from 14nm , where the company has been for several years . Intel has iterated on this process to great effect over the past few years , but has struggled to shrink those transistors down in a scalable way . For instance , Intel ’ s true successor to its 14nm processors , a 10nm processor known widely as Cannon Lake , has been delayed twice since its originally-scheduled 2016 release . At this point , we don ’ t expect to see a wide variety of laptops with these 10nm processors inside – a scant few are available now in low-end devices , while we 're still waiting for 10nm Intel Core parts – which might not arrive until the end of 2019 . Furthermore , the next phase of processors in line after Cannon Lake is an iteration on its long-delayed 10nm process known simply as ‘ 10nm+ ’ , or Ice Lake . These surely won ’ t see the light of day until 2020 , considering Intel ’ s delay of Cannon Lake and that Ice Lake is said to be an improvement upon that existing 10nm process . With that , you can imagine just how far we are from Intel processors with 7nm transistors inside . However , according to comments made by Intel recently which Anandtech picked up , the company is back on track with its 7nm manufacturing process . In fact , Intel said that its 7nm initiative has been underway alongside the 10nm project , implying that we could see these tinier chips follow much more closely behind 10nm parts than we previously thought . Regardless , Intel will have to give Cannon Lake and Ice Lake some breathing room if it wants to make any return on that manufacturing cost , much less the research and development costs . So , at the very earliest , perhaps we ’ ll see 7nm Intel chips in year-end 2020 . There you have it : exactly how close AMD and – roughly how close – Intel are to meeting Qualcomm with 7nm processors . The next battle ? Which 7nm processor will be the best .
A fresh round of leaks suggest that Intel is preparing to launch a new lineup of its NUC ( Next Unit of Computing ) mini PCs in 2019 , fitting these small-form-factor computers with some of its latest hardware and making them formidable little performers . We ’ ve been very impressed with Intel ’ s NUC devices in the past , especially this year ’ s entry , the Intel Hades Canyon NUC . They are bare-bone devices that need storage , memory and an operating system installed , making them flexible devices that can be easily upgraded , and recent entries can handle gaming as well . According to Wccftech , which has reported on existence of this new line of NUC devices , there will be two new lineups , a Coffee Lake-H Refresh “ Ghost Canyon X ” NUC line and a Comet Lake-U “ Frost Canyon ” NUC . The Ghost Canyon X lineup will apparently feature 9th generation Core processors , up to the flagship Core i9 processor . The NUC9i9QNX Ghost Canyon X features an eight-core , 16-thread Core i9 CPU , and will support a single PCIe x16 slot and come with three HDMI 2.0a ports , two Thunderbolt 3 , eight USB ports , two M.2 ports ( PCIe Gen 3 x4 ) and Optane memory support . According to Wccftech , there will also be a NUC9i7QNX Ghost Canyon X NUC with a Core i7 processor and six cores and 12 threads , and the NUC9i5QNX Ghost Canyon X with a quad-core Intel Core i5 processor . No details about the graphical capabilities of these NUCs have been revealed , but they will likely use Intel ’ s integrated UHD Graphics , as previous versions have . Apparently , they will release towards the end of 2019 . According to Wccftech , there will be Comet Lake-U Frost Canyon NUCs coming in 2019 as well . Apparently , there will be a top-end model – the NUC9i7FNH Frost Canyon – which will come with an Intel Core i7 processor with an unspecified number of cores . There will also be a NUC9i5FNH Frost Canyon NUC with a quad-core Intel Core i5 processor , and a NUC9i3FNH Frost Canyon NUC with a dual-core Intel Core i3 processor . If these specifications are accurate , then 2019 could be a great year for the mighty – and mini – NUC .

Some fresh figures show that AMD ’ s processors are outselling Intel at a rapid pace at least going by one online retailer . These are stats from German tech retailer Mindfactory , which we ’ ve looked at a number of times in the past , and as Wccftech spotted , the figures for November show that roughly speaking , AMD sold two CPUs for every single Intel model flogged . Yes – we ’ ll repeat that , because it bears repeating : AMD sold about twice as many processors , over 16,000 of them in fact , with Intel selling just under 8,000 . This is also interesting from a historical perspective , as Intel ’ s sales have remained roughly flat , with the firm having shifted around the same amount in November of last year . However , AMD sold almost double the amount of CPUs compared to November 2017 . That ’ s a massive change up of gear in terms of sales momentum for AMD , although effectively , it isn ’ t eating into Intel ’ s sales ; rather it is taking advantage of an apparently fast-growing market . Before we get too carried away , we must bear in mind that this is just one source – a single retailer – so we can hardly take it as a representation of the processor industry as a whole . That said , the upward movement in favor of AMD is certainly impressive . Particularly when you consider that Intel had the upper hand earlier this year , with AMD pulling things back to around 50-50 come August , and then going from strength to strength from there . So what was the bestselling processor overall last month ? The Ryzen 2nd Generation ( Pinnacle Ridge ) chips led the pack , unsurprisingly , with the Ryzen R5 2600 in pole position , followed by the Ryzen R7 2700X and R5 2600X in second and third place respectively . Intel ’ s Core i7 8700K has been knocked back into fourth place in terms of overall sales for November . AMD ’ s Pinnacle Ridge chips hoovered up a massive 47 % of CPU market share going by Mindfactory ’ s sales figures , with Intel ’ s Coffee Lake chips considerably behind on 22 % . Intel did better in terms of overall revenue , with the company having a higher profit margin than its chip manufacturing rival , but AMD still ( just ) took the lion ’ s share of the cash at 56 % . Another interesting nugget : Threadripper represented 2 % of AMD ’ s overall CPU sales in terms of unit shifted .

After talking about its 28-core processor for what we feel like was forever , Intel is finally releasing the Xeon W-3175X . The new workstation processor packs 28-cores , 56-threads and a whopping $ 2,999 ( about £2,280 , AU $ 4,120 ) price tag . That ’ s quite the cost even compared to the most expensive HEDT chips , including the $ 1,979 ( £1,919 , AU $ 2,999 ) Intel Core i9-9980XE and $ 1,799 ( £1,639 , AU $ 2,679 ) AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX Of course , this is a much hardier enterprise-level CPU designed to take on the biggest workloads , such as creating and rendering media , film editing and 3D graphics rendering . Not only will the Intel Xeon W-3175X do the work , it ’ ll work faster than other chips , thanks to its 3.1GHz base frequency , 4.3GHz single-core Turbo clock and 38.5MB of L3 cache . Likewise , this chip 's supporting Intel C621 chipset is meant for production system builds . The chipset brings support for up to 68 PCIe lanes ( 44 PCie 3.0 ) and six-channel DDR4-2666 memory , which will allow users to pair this processor with up to a gargantuan 512GB of RAM . While we don ’ t have any plans to review this workstation processor , as it 's outside of our scope of consumer-class components coverage , you can read all about how this processor performs from our friends at Anandtech and Tom ’ s Hardware .

AMD is one of the few tech companies surging on Wall Street this past week , besting the likes of Intel and Apple with favorable earnings . The chipmaker 's revenue of $ 1.42 billion ( about £1.09bn , AU $ 1.97bn ) for its fourth quarter means that it was up 6 % year-over-year . Yes , it narrowly missed Wall Streets ’ $ 1.44 billion ( about £1.10bn , AU $ 2bn ) estimates , its stock price is currently up more than $ 15 at the time of writing . It 's more than just the latest quarter that 's gone well for AMD . As for its annual 2018 financial results , it reported $ 6.48 billion ( about £4.96bn , AU $ 9.01bn ) in revenue and a net income of $ 337 million ( about £258m , AU $ 468m ) . That 's dramatically better than the total $ 5.3 billion ( about £4.05bn , AU $ 7.37bn ) in revenue and $ 33 million ( about £25m , AU $ 46m ) net income the company made last year . AMD attributes its growth to a 50 % increase in Ryzen desktop processor shipments and doubling enterprise-grade Epyc CPU shipments since the previous quarter . Looking toward 2019 , AMD CEO Lisa Su shared her hopes to see a 30 % increase in Ryzen desktop processor sales and a 50 % increase in notebook processor sales – the latter of which seems to be a major focus with the introduction of 2nd Gen Ryzen Mobile processors . Annual financial results time hasn ’ t been particularly kind to tech companies in 2018 . Apple announced it was seeing a continuing slump with iPhone sales , with revenue for the smartphone falling 15 % . Before Nvidia even announces its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial results on February 14 , it lowered its fourth-quarter predictions by $ 500 million ( about £382m , AU $ 695m ) . Nvidia ’ s CEO Jensen Huang cautioned “ Q4 was an extraordinary , unusually turbulent and disappointing quarter . ” So far , AMD seems like the only company not to cry wolf about “ deteriorating macroeconomic conditions ” and the slowing economy in China impacting its business .

Intel recently expanded its Coffee Lake Refresh processor lineup with integrated graphics-lacking F-series chips , and it seems to have plans for new low-power chips as well . A mysterious Intel Core i9-9900T has appeared on Yahoo Auctions , and it seems to be a cut-down , 35W version of the original , 95W Intel Core i9-9900K . According to specifications shared on the listing , the Intel Core i9-9900T will still feature identical 8-core and 16-thread as the original CPU , but with severely cut down clock speeds . Whereas the original Intel Core i9-9900K started at a 3.6GHz base clock and maxed out at 5.0GHz on one to two cores , the 9900T will supposedly run between 1.7GHz and 3.8GHz . While it isn ’ t surprising that Intel would introduce low-power versions of its existing chips , we would be surprised if the chipmaker would roll out T-series version of its Core i9 part , and with these major downgrades in frequency as well . T-series CPUs are often reserved for all-in-one and miniature PC systems . So , perhaps by limiting the 9900T by so much , Intel wants to say it has a Core i9 part in such a compact PC without running into the same overheating issues as the Core i9-powered MacBook Pro . Of course , before the chipmaker can make any claims , these T-series processors have to be officially announced . We ’ ll be on the lookout for such an announcement or any new CPU developments , so stay tuned . Via Hexus
Intel certainly isn ’ t the first player in the tech space to experiment with folding screen technology , but it ’ s definitely among the biggest to issue a patent . Obtained by Dutch tech news website LetsGoDigital , the 2017 patent exhaustively details a phone-like device that folds out into a complete tablet . The patent application from Intel is so precise that LetsGoDigital created 3D renders from the drawings , depicting the device running a mock version of Microsoft ’ s Windows 10 . Of course , we know that Microsoft is preparing its operating system for exactly this situation , so LetsGoDigital isn ’ t coming out of left field on this . Read more : Mii Mini PC Essentially , the device will stretch a single screen across three panels that fold into one another . When completely folded , the device acts like a full-screen smartphone . When one panel is left unfolded , the device acts like a tiny laptop with a touchscreen keyboard . Finally , the device becomes a full-blown tablet when completely unfolded out . This design would also support a stylus that tucks in between the folds of the displays when the device is closed , and held in place either with a clip or via magnets . This is n't the first time we ’ ve seen Intel experiment with folding and bending devices with multiple displays . During Computex 2018 in Taipei , Taiwan , Intel showed off two such prototypes as part of what is known as the Tiger Rapids project . One was a folding smartphone and another was a hybrid laptop device , and both employed two separate displays . We now know that not only has Intel been working on devices with multiple displays , but with screens that bend and fold along with the device ’ s hinges . If you thought that it was only Microsoft and Samsung that had big plans for folding screens , then prepare for a deluge of flexible devices in the near future . Via MSPowerUser

Intel has just revealed its Q4 financial results , which featured positive returns , but were below expectations . More importantly , interim chief executive Bob Swan addressed the chip giant ’ s manufacturing woes and continued shortages of its lower-end processors that most consumers favor . Intel ’ s PC-centric business ( Client Computing Group ) was actually up 10 % year-on-year in Q4 , due to ‘ continued strong demand ’ for high-performance processors , with the commercial and gaming arenas doing well . But overall PC volumes fell by 2 % , which the CEO said was due to Intel ’ s failure to produce enough chips . We heard a lot about Intel ’ s manufacturing struggles last year , with stock shortages on some 14nm processors pushing up prices , compounded by the fact that the incoming next-gen 10nm chips have been floundering and repeatedly delayed due to issues with getting acceptable yields for mass production . As PC World reports , Swan commented that the shortages had – and are still having – the biggest effect at the budget end of the processor market , because Intel is prioritizing Xeon chips for servers , a heavy demand area with plentiful profits to be made . The CEO further noted that ‘ big core ’ products such as Core i9 offerings were also a priority over mid-range processors , and the cheapest ‘ value ’ chips were last in the pecking order . In short , given Intel ‘ s focus on profit margins , something ’ s got to give manufacturing-wise , so affordable products are getting the short end of the silicon stick . Swan said that Intel ’ s manufacturing problems that have caused this CPU shortage would be resolved by the end of the second quarter , and so the implication is , that throughout this initial part of 2019 , at least , lower-end processors are still going to be thin on the ground from Intel . Therefore the time is potentially ripe for AMD to carve out more market share in that particular arena , which by all accounts , it has already been doing with some really compelling value products on the CPU front . Swan also repeated the assertion that 10nm was still on target to be all-systems-go before the year is out , with these processors still expected to ship at the end of 2019 . As for Intel ’ s overall fourth quarter financial results , the company raked in $ 18.7 billion ( £14.2 billion , AU $ 26.1 billion ) in revenue , which was up 9 % year-on-year , with $ 5.2 billion ( £4 billion , AU $ 7.3 billion ) in profit . However , that fell short of analyst expectations . One of the reasons Intel picked out for the weaker than predicted performance was a slowdown in sales from China .

With much of the focus at CES 2019 given to gadgets or toys that may never amount to much beyond some January headlines , it ’ s important to remember that the show is also a chance for the true superpowers of technology to show off their hard work . Intel ’ s stand was one of the largest and most striking at CES 2019 , showing demos from 5G to autonomous vehicles to VR gaming , with the company ’ s keynote at the show containing far more news and announcements than many expected . This all plays in to the message that Intel wants to put across - the company is far more than just the chip inside your laptop or desktop PC , it wants to extend its computing expertise to help power the increasingly smart , connected world . “ The message we wanted to deliver is that we have a much much bigger reach that we are expanding into , ” Sandra Rivera , Intel 's senior vice president of the network platforms group , told TechRadar Pro at the show . “ Historically where you would have thought of Intel as being very big in the PC market , or the data centre market , of course , we are those things and more . ” With more and more data being created every day , and the Internet of Things extending its reach across the world , the need for reliable , flexible and scalable computing at the edge is paramount , and Intel is stepping up to the plate to provide these services . “ We 're expanding beyond our traditional PC-centric company that has been most of our history to a company that really powers all of the data that really impacts how we live work and play , ” she added . “ Data really touches everything that we do - and moving to this pillar of growth around everything that 's data-centric - including of course the PC - is really the strategy that we have been driving . '' 5G will play a key role in Intel ’ s expansion , Rivera says , with the launch of the new high-speed networks representing “ a true convergence between computing and communications ” . The new networks will require serious amounts of computing power to deploy , operate and maintain , providing a great opportunity for Intel to flex its muscle . CES 2019 also saw Intel making a bold play in moving into comms hardware , targeting the chips powering 5G base stations for the first time . The company is aiming to go from zero to 40 percent market share by 2022 as it looks to once again position itself as the scrappy underdog . “ When you think about bringing this problem close to the compute machine , you now have the opportunity to think about this as a high-performance computing problem - and if it is a high-performance computing problem , we believe that Intel is best- placed to fix it , ” Rivera says . The company showed off its initial 5G handiwork at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang , and is now looking ahead to Tokyo 2020 to highlight exactly what it can do . This desire to fight is set to be a key cornerstone of Intel ’ s outlook going forward , Rivera says , as it comes to terms with increasing competition in all markets . “ We have this mindset of we 're not the 80 or 90 percent market share guy - we 're more like the 25 or 30 percent with headroom to grow , ” she notes . “ Everywhere that you can have things and devices that are smart and connected ... the opportunity to collect and aggregate that data , and turn that data into valuable insights that drive some positive action - we think we have a very valuable role to play . ” “ We like the idea of being the scrappy and hungry underdog , ” she adds , “ We 're at our best when we 're hungry . ”

Last year , Intel poached a portion of AMD ’ s graphics department talent , and now Team Blue may well buy the whole red company this year . At least that ’ s the going rumor according to the EETimes , which claims to have picked up word that Intel may acquire AMD from a few C-Level executives at the company . However , this all seems unlikely to happen for a number of reasons , if you ask us . This is hardly the first time Intel has been rumored to buy out AMD , with the biggest difference this time around being that AMD is in a position of strength now . We can just look at the two companies ’ performances at CES 2019 to see which is doing better . Intel spent its presentation on dissuading any doubt surrounding the existence of its 10nm processors by demonstrating five different iterations of its future-facing silicon in action . AMD , on the other hand , had a much more focused keynote with three product lines coming this year . The keynote included AMD ’ s next-generation 7nm Ryzen 3rd Generation processor , a return to high-end graphics cards with the Radeon VII and its renewed mission to capture the laptop market with 2nd Gen Ryzen mobile chips . Aside from AMD having much more to lose than gain from the acquisition , there are several regulatory and anti-trust hurdles to overcome if such a merger were to take place . So , we ’ d say that Intel buying AMD is a fairly long shot at this point . Rather , this year seems likely to be one of the most interesting times for computing in a long time with the big three ( Intel , AMD and Nvidia ) really going at each other . Via HotHardware
Intel has just rung the death knell for Core+ packages that bundle a CPU with an Optane module . These Core+ offerings consisted of an 8th-generation Intel Core processor bundled with a 16GB Optane cache drive , and they came in three different flavors : Core+ i5-8400 , Core+ i5-8500 and Core+ i7-8700 . As Tom ’ s Hardware reports ( via PC World ) , the bundles have been marked as discontinued by Intel , the reason being a “ lack of market demand ” . If you still wish to get hold of one of these bundles , the cut-off date for ordering is September 30 , 2019 – assuming that stock is still available at that point . The final shipments are expected to be out by December 27 at the latest . Intel ’ s Optane products leverage 3D XPoint technology , which the company worked on jointly with Micron – although last year , the partnership was dissolved , with Micron subsequently announcing that it would be buying out Intel ’ s share of the joint venture ( Intel Micron Flash Technologies ) . And just this week , Micron confirmed it is buying up the fab the two companies jointly operated to manufacture 3D XPoint goodies . That doesn ’ t mean Intel won ’ t independently continue to work with 3D XPoint – which was originally billed as the biggest memory architecture breakthrough in 25 years since the arrival of NAND – in its own fabs , so we will still see products in the future . Although it ’ s the end of the road for the aforementioned Intel bundles , of course . An Intel spokesman told PC World : “ We have a number of manufacturing options available to us and have been shipping a broad portfolio of Intel Optane technology products for more than a year . We ’ ll continue to expand our product line and lead the industry with this exciting , new technology . ”

Intel is readying a new HEDT ( high-end desktop ) Core X processor which bristles with 14-cores and runs at up to 5GHz with Turbo , at least according to the CPU grapevine . The Core i9-9990XE will supposedly have a beefy base clock of 4GHz out of the box , and will be capable of boosting to 5GHz as mentioned . It will run with 14-cores and 28-threads , and will reportedly have a TDP of 255W . The processor is inbound from Intel according to multiple sources who spoke to Anandtech , and they believe this chip will only be available to system makers , and even then via auction , as opposed to just being able to order one straight off the bat . The 9990XE ’ s clock speeds are considerably faster than the current top-of-the-range Core i9-9980XE ( pictured above ) which runs at 3GHz out of the box with Turbo to 4.5GHz . Although it would have less cores than the current flagship , as the 9980XE offers 18-cores . The TDP is also considerably higher than all the other models in the Core X range , which are 165W processors . There ’ s no speculated price point for this particular CPU , because it isn ’ t a chip you will just be able to buy . It will only be available to selected OEMs who will have to bid for the privilege in auctions held every three months . The current flagship Core i9-9980XE retails at an eye-watering $ 1,979 ( around £1,540 , AU $ 2,750 ) , and in our review we praised the CPU for its class-leading performance , providing you have the money to spend . However , bear in mind that there are more ( relatively speaking ) wallet-friendly high-end processors available which aren ’ t far off the performance of the 9980XE . Assuming this rumor comes good , it ’ ll certainly be interesting to see what sort of performance a heavyweight Core X processor can provide when pushed up to these sort of clock speeds out of the box ( and potentially overclocked further , of course ) .

As the race towards 5G gathers pace , technology giants are jostling for position as they look to be the ones providing the infrastructure needed for the next-generation networks . Intel is one of the firms leading the way , and spoke to TechRadar Pro last week at CES 2019 in Las Vegas to outline just why it thinks it can be the power behind 5G . For Intel , 5G represents “ a true convergence between computing and communications , ” Sandra Rivera , Intel 's senior vice president of the network platforms group , told us , noting that the company ’ s expertise in computing will stand it in good stead in the smart , IoT-connected world . “ Everywhere that you can have things and devices that are smart and connected ... the opportunity to collect and aggregate that data , and turn that data into valuable insights that drive some positive action - we think we have a very valuable role to play , ” she said . “ When you think about bringing this problem close to the compute machine , you now have the opportunity to think about this as a high-performance computing problem - and if it is a high-performance computing problem , we believe that Intel is best- placed to fix it . ” The company publicly tested its 5G infrastructure at last year ’ s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang , and is now preparing another major showcase at Tokyo 2020 to really demonstrate it can be a leader in this space . At CES 2019 , Intel surprised many by revealing a Snow Ridge networking SoC focused on supplying 5G internet access as it looks to strengthen its hand in the network space . Providing connection speeds of up to 100GB/second , the new hardware will launch in wireless base stations , a market that is entirely new to Intel , but one it hopes to quickly conquer , with Rivera saying that Intel aims to take 40 percent of what is a hugely competitive market by 2022 . The company also unveiled Project Athena , a new industry standard for high-powered laptops that will be engineered for next-generation technologies like 5G and AI . Intel said it expects the first 5G-enabled Project Athena laptop to go on sale in the second half of 2019 , most likely powered by its new family of Ice Lake processors . Rivera promised that Intel would have more to say about its 5G work at Mobile World Congress next month , but it ’ s clear that the company is determined to make a big impact in the market . “ If you look at 5G , from the client to the access to the edge , or to the cloud , in every single part of that continuum , you 're using Intel technology , ” she says . “ We 're pretty confident that when you look at 5G ... it 's clear it does run on Intel . ”

Updated : Intel has confirmed that these indeed are the six new desktop chips as well as release date and pricing information for the entire F-series CPU family . With the launch of Ryzen 3rd Generation processors just around the corner , Intel has headed AMD off and used its CES event to announce six new 9th-gen Core processors , ranging from Core i3 to Core i9 , set to release soon . The new line of processors are as follows : The new processors join the company 's three existing 'flagship ' 9th-generation desktop chips , which launched in October last year – the Core i5-9600K , i7-9700K and i9-9900K – as well as the 9th-generation X-series for HEDT systems . What 's perhaps most intriguing about them is that five of the six new chips are part of a brand new F-series of processors , which have removed ( or most likely disabled ) the integrated graphics chip that almost every mainstream Intel processor has included up until now . One would think that these stripped down processors might be an attempt to reduce costs ( as it will allow the chip-maker to sell CPUs with non-functional GPUs ) – unfortunately that is n't the case . Rather , Intel plans to sell its integrated graphics-less F-series chips at the very same prices as it traditional desktop processors . From this pricing scheme Intel shared with us , we can see the Intel Core i9-9900K and Intel Core i9-9900KF are both priced at $ 488 ( about £380 , AU $ 690 ) despite the latter CPU missing one key feature . The same pricing trend can be found on the Core i7-9700KF , Core i5-9600KF and even the Core i5-9400F . It 's a baffling product stack and we triple checked its authenticity with Intel just to make sure it was right . Before you get too riled up , Intel assured us that these are n't prices meant for consumers , but its commercial partners ( such as system integrators like Dell and HP ) . So the good news is Intel does n't plan to rip off consumers , but its partners ? We 're not sure how this seems like a sound business strategy to Intel , but at the very least we 'll get more desktop processors soon . The Core i3-9350K will be the first entry-level chip from the Intel 's Coffee Lake Refresh family . Priced at $ 173 ( about £140 , AU $ 240 ) , the Core i3-9350K will also be the first F-series chip set to arrive this month with more rolling out through the second quarter of this year .

Intel Optane storage was arguably too ahead of its time , with 3D XPoint memory that was incredibly fast but far too limited in storage capacity . Now , at CES 2019 , Intel may have solved this bugbear with its latest Optane Memory H10 module . This seemingly normal M.2 SSD drive pictured combines a tiny amount of Intel Optane memory with a large dollop of QLC 3D NAND storage . There are currently three models of Intel ’ s Optane Memory H10 : 16GB ( Optane ) + 256GB ( QLC ) ; 32GB ( Optane ) +512GB ( QLC ) ; and 32GB ( Optane ) + 1TB ( QLC ) . With this type of mash up , the Intel Optane Memory H10 module effectively gives you the best of both worlds , with extremely fast Optane memory having enough capacity for more than just your operating system . Intel tells us that , in most OEM prebuilt systems and laptops , the Intel Optane Memory H10 will be preconfigured to look like a single device . Builders , on the other hand , may see the unit as two distinct storage drives but , once enabled , the Intel Optane Memory driver and Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver will combine the two drives and present the Intel Optane Memory H10 as a single storage device in your PC . Unfortunately , that Optane Memory built into the drive does n't also speed up spinning hard drives as standalone Optane Memory is designed to do . The 3D XPoint memory will only work in conjunction with the solid-state drive it 's integrated with – which is n't too bad considering these drives can come with up to 1TB of storage .
Intel ’ s plans for 5G are extending from the device into mobile network infrastructure with the launch of a new processor for base stations . At the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas , the chip giant detailed ‘ Snow Ridge ’ – a system on a chip ( SoC ) platform that promises to make base stations more intelligent and enable low-latency applications . 5G networks will enable faster speeds , greater capacity and ultra-low latency . But the latency promise can only be fulfilled through a decentralisation of the core network so that data can be processed nearer the point of collection . Intel believes its expertise in edge computing and in the data centre means it can increase its base station market share from 0 in 2014 to 40 per cent in 2022 . Snow Ridge promises 100Gbps data rates and the ability to offer multiple streams for different types of application . Crucially , it is capable of prioritising certain types of data traffic , meaning that latency-sensitive applications will be given priority over video streaming for example . It is thought the chip will be released later this year , complementing the company ’ s other pursuits in 5G . Intel has partnered with a number of operators in 5G testing and plans to launch a 5G modem in 2019 . It has been tipped to help launch a 5G iPhone in 2020 using its 8161 modem and there are plans to bring 5G connectivity to laptops . The company also helped deliver 5G-enabled broadcasts at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang , with 22 links at 10 sites delivering 3,800TB of network capacity . The first 5G smartphones are expected within the next few months , the majority of which will be powered by Qualcomm ’ s technology .
Intel has revealed its latest generation of data centre hardware at CES 2019 . The chip giant took the wraps off its new Cascade Lake chips as it looks to show off its new 10nm architecture and improve data centre computing for users around the globe . `` We ’ ve come to recognise that the data centre is this quiet force behind the scenes that moves and processes data , and really creates value for all of us , ” said Navin Shenoy , Intel executive vice president in the Data Center Group . The new chips , described by Shenoy as being “ designed to handle processing the world ’ s data ” , offer support for up to 48-core architecture , providing a significant boost for Intel ’ s data centre customers . There ’ s also now support for Intel DL Boost , which is designed to accelerate AI deep learning inference , as well as and Intel ’ s Optane DC persistent memory technology , making it faster than traditional SSD hardware , however this means that apps recognise it as large memory - so can deliver data even when power is out . The launch comes as Intel celebrated 20 years of its Xeon processor , which continues to go from strength to strength , achieving 95 world records , the company says . But Intel is also looking to the future , with Shenoy also showing off the next generation of its Xeon hardware . Codenamed “ Ice Lake ” , the 10nm chips are compatible with the upcoming 14nm Cooper Lake processors , with Intel hoping to deliver performance improvements , new hardware-enhanced security features and more , with shipments targeted for 2020 .
Intel is n't messing around . At its CES 2019 keynote it introduced Ice Lake , the very first series of its processors to be built upon its 10nm Sunny Cove architecture . The company did n't just announce the chip was coming – it showed an actual piece of silicon and even performance testing with a laptop powered by the new CPU . The company claimed that Ice Lake chips can search for images two times faster than even a modern laptop . Ice Lake will also be Intel 's first chips to come with built-in Thunderbolt 3 integration , Wi-Fi connectivity and Gen11 graphics – the last of which is capable of powering a 4K display . Intel also demonstrated how users will be able to play with its amped-up Gen II integrated graphics . Unfortunately , Intel did n't disclose any setting that they were playing the game at . Dell 's president of Client Solutions Group , Sam Burd , also appeared on stage to show that the company already has a working engineering sample equipped with an Ice Lake processor . Intel also announced Project Athena , its ambitious program to push mobile computing to its next era . In its mission , the chipmaker plans to work with hardware manufacturers to develop thinner and lighter products to recapture the thunder that birthed Ultrabooks . Project Athena will be an industry-wide initiative and Intel plans to work with every manufacturer including Huawei , Dell , HP , Asus and Lenovo to name a few . Intel recently announced a new Foveros technology that would allow it to create processors that would pair different types of processor cores into the same chip for a more rounded CPU . Today , we 're finally seeing the fruits of this new technology in the form of LakeField chips . LakeField is closer to the processors that power your phone in that they pair big , performance-focused CPUs with smaller low-energy CPUs . With this blend of processor cores , your device will be able to handle all your tasks on demand and save your battery life when it 's just on standby . What 's more , this chips can act as systems on a chip if they also have integrated graphics , memory and other modules . To demonstrate this development , Intel pulled out a motherboard board fitted with LakeField processor no larger than a Roku Streaming Stick . The 12mm square package ( the equivalent of five quarters lined up . Intel Showed off includes a single 10nm Sunny Cove core and four additional Atom cores . Intel ended its LakeField demonstration by revealing two prototype systems , a small tablet system and a more typical laptop . According to the chipmaker , LakeField can scale from low power systems to full PC performance machines .

Samsung has revealed a refreshed Notebook 9 Pro over at CES 2019 , plus the PC vendor launched the Notebook Flash which will be available imminently in the US . Just like its predecessor , the new Notebook 9 Pro is a sleek and slim 2-in-1 featuring a stylish design – with a metal construction and diamond-cut edges – yet it still offers plenty in the performance stakes . In this refresh it gains an 8th-gen Intel Core i7-8565U quad-core ( eight-thread ) processor with a base clock of 1.8GHz , which is capable of turbo up to 4.6GHz when the chip needs to stretch its legs . That ’ s backed with 8GB of system RAM , and a 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD ( plus integrated graphics – Intel UHD 620 to be precise ) . The 13.3-inch model runs with a Full HD display and has seen the screen bezel slimmed down to 6.7mm , and the backlit keyboard has been ‘ comprehensively redesigned ’ , Samsung notes ( although we already felt it was spacious and comfy in the existing model ) . Samsung is promising up to 14 hours of battery life , although it doesn ’ t qualify that figure with any details on the usage type ( presumably light use ) . You get fast charging , as well . Furthermore , buyers benefit from a pair of 1.5W stereo speakers which have Thunder Amp technology that ensures the volume can get pretty loud ( relative to the speaker size , at least ) . Connectivity includes a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports , a USB Type-C connector , and a microSD slot . The Samsung Notebook 9 Pro ( which comes with an Active Pen boasting 4,000 levels of pressure sensitivity ) is expected to emerge early in 2019 , with the price still to be confirmed . Samsung was also showing off the Notebook Flash at CES , and announced that this affordable laptop will be launching in the US on January 15 . It will be available direct from Samsung and Amazon with a starting price of $ 349.99 ( around £275 , AU $ 490 ) in charcoal color only . Launched in Asia last year , the Notebook Flash runs with an Intel Celeron N4000 processor , or you can fork out $ 399.99 ( around £315 , AU $ 560 ) for the model which steps up to an Intel Pentium Silver N5000 CPU . Both flavors are equipped with 4GB of memory , 64GB of eMMC storage , 802.11ac 2x2 Wi-Fi and a 13.3-inch Full HD anti-glare display . The claimed battery life is up to 10 hours according to Samsung , and connectivity includes a pair of USB Type-C ports , two further USB connectors ( 3.0 and 2.0 ) plus a microSD slot . The Notebook Flash has a fingerprint scanner , and a retro typewriter-style keyboard design both of which differentiate it from your run-of-the-mill budget notebook . Note that Samsung has also revealed the Notebook Odyssey gaming laptop at CES , which we ’ ve already covered .
Corsair has announced the One Pro i180 , the company ’ s most powerful and compact gaming desktop it has ever created . Fitted with an Intel Core i9-9920X and Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti , Corsair has gone even so far as to claim its gaming desktop is now as powerful as a workstation . Both the 12-core processor and GPU fitted into this system are liquid-cooled by the brand ’ s latest platinum-series cooling systems . In order to expel the added level of heat from its latest system , Corsair claims it has reinvented its patented convection-assisted liquid cooling system while also restructuring the internal layout for better airflow . These improvements help the Corsair One Pro i180 run 22-degrees Celsius cooler than even its previous Coffee Lake-powered systems like the Corsair One Elite . This is even more significant when you consider this PC has gone from using a 95W TDP CPU to one rated at a 165W . The Corsair One Pro i180 also comes fitted with 32GB of Corsair DDR4 memory , a 960GB high-speed M.2 SSD drive and 2TB HDD . Of course , a PC this powerful demands a high price and it ’ ll be available for $ 4,999 ( about £3,915 , AU $ 7,000 ) when it arrives on February 12th with pre-orders beginning today . Alongside its flagship gaming PC , Corsair also introduced two additional versions of the One . The Corsair One i160 is a slight step down from its bigger brother , but still a very powerful system thanks to its Intel Core i9-9900K processor and GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card . One more tier down is the Corsair One i140 that features an Intel Core i7-9700K processor and GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card . Both of these PCs also feature 32GB of Corsair DDR4 memory , a 480GB high-speed M.2 SSD drive and 2TB HDD . The Corsair One i160 will arrive on February 12th for $ 3,599 ( about £2,820 , AU $ 5,040 ) , meanwhile , the Corsair One i140 is available immediately for $ 2,999 ( about £2,350 , AU $ 4,200 ) .

Asus has announced a new series of compact PCs which are packed with enough power – including 9th-gen Intel Core processors – to qualify as workstation-class computers capable of tackling the sort of intensive tasks that creative professionals might undertake . The Asus Mini PC ProArt PA90 initially arrives as a range of three machines using Core i7 or Core i9 Intel 9th-geneation processors which boast around 30 % better performance than their predecessor CPUs . The processor also benefits from liquid cooling , which is pretty nifty in a compact PC . And that processing power is backed up with Nvidia Quadro graphics , with the Quadro P2000 ( sporting 5GB of video RAM ) nestling inside the entry-level model , and the Quadro P4000 ( 8GB ) featuring in the mid-range and high-end flavors of the mini PC . The top-end model is the one that uses Intel ’ s Core i9-9900K processor , with the other two PCs employing the Core i7-9700K . In terms of storage , the entry-level PC offers up a 256GB PCIe SSD twinned with a 1TB spinning hard disk , and the mid-range and flagship models double up the SSD to 512GB ( you can also optionally add a second SSD if required ) . All the machines come with 32GB of DDR4 2666MHz system memory as a baseline , although up to 64GB of RAM can be specified if needed . On the connectivity front , you get two Thunderbolt 3 ports , and the ProArt PA90 is backed by a three-year warranty . Expect these compact PCs to emerge in March , but they won ’ t be cheap , with pricing for the entry-level model pitched at £2,499.99 ( around $ 3,140 , AU $ 4,500 ) , moving up to £2,999.99 ( around $ 3,770 , AU $ 5,400 ) for the mid-range offering , and £3,199.99 ( around $ 4,020 , AU $ 5,770 ) for the top dog Core i9 machine .

This last year has been a bizarre one in the world of PC components . AMD , Intel and Nvidia have all launched major product lines that ruled their prospective portions of the market – at least for a little while . AMD launched its Ryzen and Threadripper 2nd Generation lineups , which brought about fantastic performance at a bargain price , while Nvidia launched Turing and the best graphics cards we ’ ve ever seen . And , Intel ? Well , Intel released four different microarchitectures to varying degrees of success . But , what will 2019 look like ? As all of these manufacturers mobilize to launch more efficient silicon than ever before , will we finally start seeing 7-nanometer ( nm ) processors in the mainstream ? Or , will AMD launch a line of graphics cards that gives the RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti a run for their money ? What will the mid- and low-end Nvidia Turing cards look like ? For years , AMD has been playing the underdog both in graphics cards and the best processors . However , now that AMD is selling twice as many processors as Intel , it ’ s heading into the new year as a dominant force in the market – even if it still needs to catch up to Nvidia . Ryzen 3rd Generation . The AMD Ryzen 3000 series processors are a sure thing in 2019 , and while leaks have pointed to them being 16-core monstrosities with core speeds up to 4.7GHz , we think that ’ s a little bit pie-in-the-sky . Still , AMD is shrinking its manufacturing process to 7nm in 2019 , according to leaked road maps from Informatica Cero , so we ’ ll likely see better efficiency and performance across the board – hopefully while keeping its stellar price-to-performance balance . Threadripper 3rd Generation . As is the norm over the last couple years , we ’ ll likely see a new line of Threadripper HEDT processors show up in Summer 2019 . The leaked roadmap we mentioned earlier points to a “ Castle Peak ” architecture following AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2nd Generation , likely based on the same Zen 2 process as Ryzen 3rd Generation . Similar to its mainstream Ryzen platform , we expect AMD ’ s next HEDT line to bring improved efficiency and performance . AMD Vega 7nm . AMD has a press conference at CES 2019 , and we ’ re pretty sure that it ’ s going to announce 7nm Vega graphics cards for creatives and professionals . We ’ ve already seen AMD tease 7nm graphics cards for CES , and the AMD Vega II logo has been revealed in a trademark application . It ’ s a pretty safe bet that AMD Vega II will be revealed very soon . AMD Navi . But , what about consumer graphics cards ? Ever since Nvidia launched Turing with , frankly , insane prices , we ’ ve been hoping AMD Navi would come out and give Team Green some much-needed competition . We ’ ve seen a leak that suggests that AMD will release an RX 3080 , which would compete with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 for half the price . If this is true , 2019 is going to be an exciting year for graphics cards We know significantly less about what Intel is going to do in 2019 . It ’ s known that the silicon giant is going to do something , but the specifics are a bit arcane at the moment . Between Cannon Lake , Sunny Cove and some HEDT chips , we ’ re sure following Intel is going to be a rollercoaster this year – like it is every year . Sunny Cove ? Cannon Lake ? Coffee Lake Refresh just came out a couple months ago , bringing extremely high core counts and clock speeds together for the first time – the Intel Core i9-9900K blows everything out of the water . It ’ s still a stopgap , though . We ’ ve been waiting for 10nm Cannon Lake processors for years now , so hopefully we ’ ll see some more efficient silicon in 2019 – even if it ’ s called Sunny Cove instead . More laptop processors . Even though Intel ’ s 9th generation of processors kicked off in October 2018 with Coffee Lake Refresh , we ’ re still seeing a ton of laptops with the 8th-generation Kaby Lake Refresh processors that launched all the way back in 2018 . We expect Intel to refresh mainstream laptops next year , though we ’ d be happy if we saw more laptops with Whisky Lake chips . Intel graphics cards . Intel has been hinting at launching its own line of graphics cards for a while now , and we have to say : we ’ re intrigued . While Intel has come out and said that it ’ s on track to release graphics cards in 2020 , not 2019 , Intel will likely show off some of its new graphics architecture . Will they be consumer cards ? Or – what we think is more likely – GPUs aimed at taking on Nvidia Volta and AMD Vega in the professional space ? We ’ ll just have to wait and see . Nvidia had a pretty action-packed 2018 , so we ’ re not expecting anything groundbreaking from the graphics giant . It already launched Turing for consumers and Volta for data scientists and professionals , so we ’ ll likely see those lineups expand throughout the year . More Turing desktop graphics . We ’ ve started to see some leaks and speculation crop up about the Nvidia RTX 2060 start to surface . The Nvidia Turing lineup , as it exists today , is extremely expensive , so we ’ re hoping that whatever the RTX 2060 is capable of , it ’ ll be more affordable for mainstream consumers . Not everyone wants to drop a thousand bills on a graphics card . RTX Mobility . Sure , the best gaming PCs have had access to Nvidia Turing for a few months now , but what about gaming laptops ? Well , word on the street is that Nvidia will announce RTX Mobility graphics for laptops at CES 2019 . We ’ ll likely see the RTX 2070 Max-Q as the premiere mobile GPU , but we could see the RTX 2080 make its way to a laptop near you as well .

Intel has released a new video to give us a detailed look and breakdown of its upcoming Lakefield hybrid processor . Lakefield should sound familiar if you caught wind of it during CES 2019 , when it was first unveiled as a hybrid processor designed to compete with Qualcomm ’ s Snapdragon computing APUs . In fact , this new video is actually more of an extended cut of the demo video that Lakefield debuted with at Intel ’ s keynote . From the video , we can see the Lakefield processor makes use of the Foveros 3D design packaging to stack a massive array of memory on top of the chips ’ s main cores , which in themselves contain a mix of 'big ' and 'small ' CPUs . Intel has told us this chip will use a mix of 10nm Sunny Cove performance-focused CPUs and other 10nm-based smaller low-energy CPUs . Aside from those main processor components , we can see other pieces like Intel ’ s Gen11 integrated graphics as well as interfaces for cameras and hardwired connections , or I/O . This layout essentially makes the Intel Lakefield processor more like a System on a Chip ( SoC ) processor you would find in your phone , wherein almost every major component is found on the processor chip , and a major deviation from the monolithic chips typically found in computers today . But , don ’ t think Intel is making a CPU for just phones and tablets , the video ends by showing how Lakefield can power a wide range of devices from traditional notebooks to 2-in-1 convertible and detachable laptops . The footage even suggests dual-screen laptops similar to the Intel Tiger Rapids and Asus Project Precog could get this new hybrid processor . Lakefield might seem like a pipe dream , but Intel has promised it will be in production this year . The company has yet to announce a possible ship window , but you can be sure we ’ ll report the date – and anything else – as soon as we hear it .

Last December , Intel revealed its new Gen11 integrated graphics solution at its Architecture Day event , and now we might have an idea of what the chipmaker 's upcoming iGPU ( Integrated Graphics Processing Unit ) is truly capable of . Spotted by a Reddit user over the weekend , some in-depth benchmarks for a Gen11 part have leaked online , with the results from GFXBench and CompuBench indicating an iGPU that effectively outperforms other 15W chips – that includes AMD 's current Ryzen 7 2700U and Ryzen 5 2400G , and Intel 's own Core i5-8250U . As reported by Tom 's Hardware , the Gen11 chip in question boasts up to one teraflop of 32-bit and two teraflops of 16-bit floating point performance right from graphics processor integrated into the CPU – no standalone graphics card necessary . The Gen11 Iris Plus Graphics 940 iGPU that 's been tested is roughly 62.97 % faster on average than the AMD Vega 10 ( as seen in the aforementioned Ryzen 7 2700U ) in the GFXBench 5.0 benchmark test . Admittedly , that number is due in large part to the older Manhattan test , which returns an abnormally high score . When that 's removed from the equation , that number drops to a more reasonable 44.81 % . Of course , these benchmark scores are completely unofficial for the time being , and are likely not a true reflection of Gen11 's real-world gaming performance . That said , they are incredibly impressive results – for a complete rundown of the Gen11 benchmarks , head over to Tom 's Hardware .

It 's no secret that Apple has been considering ditching Intel processors for its Mac and MacBook devices in favour of its own ARM-based CPU , and now it seems like the company will make the move as soon as next year . According to the Axios website , developers and Intel insiders have privately revealed that Intel expects Apple to move to custom ARM-based chips in 2020 . Read more : Apple AirPods ( 2019 ) This follows reports that Apple is looking to make it easier for iPad and iPhone apps to run on Macs . As we noted a few days ago , Apple wants developers to be able to build a single app once and deploy it to all of Apple ’ s device platforms simultaneously by 2021 . One way of ensuring this is if Macs , iPhones and iPads all run on similar ARM-based processors . While we ’ ve known that Apple has been looking to move from Intel CPUs for a while now , the fact that Intel is now apparently bracing itself to be dropped from Mac devices by 2020 makes it more likely that we will see non-Intel Macs as early as next year . The move to an entirely new processor architecture won ’ t be easy – especially considering software compatibility – but it gives Apple an even tighter grip on the hardware that powers its Mac computers . Perhaps we ’ ll hear more about Intel-free Macs at Apple ’ s WWDC 2019 event in June .

Intel graphics cards aren ’ t here yet and won ’ t be for awhile , but Intel is already trying to build up a community around them . Today Intel has launched a new community program it calls “ The Odyssey , ” which will allow users to discuss and share their ideas of how the company should develop its upcoming graphics cards . This is more than a journey . It is an Odyssey to improve visual computing experiences . But we can ’ t do it alone . We invite our community to join us . https : //t.co/aj1vaq79vr # JoinTheOdyssey pic.twitter.com/s0uQcChWJ6February 20 , 2019 In its mission statement , Intel officially says that The Odyssey is a “ community-based program designed to facilitate two-way conversation where Intel will listen , engage and bring along a genuinely passionate community on a journey into a better visual experience . `` Participants will have the opportunity to learn about the latest advancements in hardware and software platform technologies , as well as industry collaborations that ’ ll enhance the content creation and gaming experience . ” AMD and Nvidia both have their respective groups of followers , but Intel appears to be extending an open hand to getting its community onboard even as it ’ s developing its future products . Initially , The Odyssey will function as a mailing list and anyone can sign up for the program here . Intel is also holding a kick-off community event at the Gaming Developers Conference ( GDC ) in San Francisco on March 20th . In the future , the Intel will also inform those on its Odyssey mailing of the latest developments as well as invites to company-sponsored events . At these online and offline events , users will be able to speak with Intel executives and developers . Hopefully we ’ ll hear more about Intel ’ s graphics cards in the near future .

A team of researchers have discovered a way to run malicious code on systems with Intel chips in such a way that antivirus software is unable to detect it . When the chip giant released its Skylake processors back in 2015 , the company included a new feature called Software Guard eXtensions ( SGX ) that allows developers to isolate applications inside secure enclaves . The enclaves operate within a hardware-isolated section of the CPU 's processing memory where applications can carry out operations dealing with sensitive details such as encryption keys , passwords , user data and more . Researchers Michael Schwarz , Samuel Weiser and Daniel Gruss ( who helped discover last year 's Spectre attack ) published a paper detailing how they were able to use SGX enclaves to hide malware that is undetectable by today 's security solutions . Intel has made it difficult to create and load a malicious enclave by requiring SGX to only accept and launch enclaves that have been signed with a signature key from an internal whitelist of approved keys . While these keys are usually only given to approved developers , the researchers discovered four ways an attacker could gain access to a signature key to sign a malicious enclave . A malicious enclave would still have difficulty infecting a system because SGX enclaves are restricted to a few commands and lack access to the operations carried out by a local operating system . However , the researchers were able to bypass this limitation by using a return-oriented programming ( ROP ) exploitation technique to piggy-back on Intel Transcational Synchronization eXtensions ( TSX ) . This gave the enclave access to a wider set of commands than normal which could be used to carry out an attack . Despite the fact that the team exploited SGX to run malicious code for research purposes , the discovery has huge cybersecurity implications since today 's security products are unequipped to detect malware running inside an SGX enclave . The researchers ' paper titled “ Practical Enclave Malware with Intel SGX ” has now been published and it is certainly worth a read for those that want to learn more . Via Ars Technica
Intel ’ s 9th generation processor rollout has been a wild ride with the introduction of new F-series CPUs , the company ’ s first 28-core processor and now the secretive sale of an Intel Core i9-9990XE chip . According Puget Systems , Intel just held a secret quarterly auction where the company sold a new , unheard of 14-core Core i9-9990XE CPU for $ 2,300 . That ’ s a fairly extravagant selling price for a high-end desktop processor , especially when Intel ’ s current Basin Falls Refresh flagship chip , the 18-core Intel Core i9-9990XE , costs noticeably less at $ 1,999 ( £1,999 , AU $ 2,729 ) . That said , bear in mind that this chip wasn ’ t just bought at a store , but an auction for the privilege of being one of the first to test this chip . What makes the Intel Core i9-9990XE worth all that cheddar ? Well Puget Systems has shared that this 14-cores and 28-threads CPU comes with a mighty fast 4.0 GHz base clock and an incredible 5.0GHz all-core boost . Comparatively , the Intel Core i9-9980XE might feature 18-cores and 36-threads , but it only runs at clock speeds between 3.0GHz and 4.4GHz . These high-frequencies makes the Intel Core i9-9990XE a capable performer and Puget Systems also reported that it scored 221 and 3,732 points in Cinebench single-core and multi-core tests , respectively . In our testing , the Intel Core i9-9900K only managed to land 1,873 points in Cinebench multi-core and even the Intel Core i9-9980XE lags behind with a 3,640 point score . From what we can tell , the Intel Core i9-9990XE seems to be worthy of its name sake . However , Puget Systems has also noted that the processor runs hot nearly all the time , will see limited availability , lacks any warranty and is obviously expensive . All told , it seems unlikely that this this CPU come to store shelves as a standalone part , but rather be available in a select few pre-built systems only by speciality brands like Origin or Digital Storm . Want one for a custom build ? Only time will tell if the Intel Core i9-9990XE actually releases . Via Tom 's Hardware

Updated : Intel has given us a response noting that some Intel Core i5-9400F series processors and other F-series processors will indeed feature a polymer ( or thermal paste-based ) thermal interface material , but CPUs ending with a KF suffix will maintain a soldered TIM . We 've updated our story to reflect this new information . Intel ’ s new F-series processors were already plenty interesting for dropping integrated graphics without being any cheaper , and now we have learned some of them won ’ t feature nearly as robust cooling either . It appears that momomo_US has got its hands on an Intel Core i5-9400F , removed its lid and revealed the processor will utilize a grease-based thermal interface material ( TIM ) . Core i5-9400F ( 6C die / U0 ) Core i5-9600K ( 8C die / P0 ) # 殻割り # delid pic.twitter.com/wp429U16V3February 2 , 2019 Intel later confirmed with us that the processor in the image is indeed an authentic F-series processor . However , the chip maker also stressed that F-series processors will come with either a polymer ( read : thermal paste ) or soldered TIM depending on the manufacturing process . Additionally , all CPUs ending with the suffix 'KF ' will still feature a soldered TIM . We 've asked Intel how it will note which processors come with which thermal interface material on its retail packaging and are still awaiting an reply . It worth nothing that most F-series not ending in an KF suffix are locked and ca n't be overclocked . So users who keep their chips running at stock speeds likely wo n't miss the biggest benefits of a soldered TIM . That said , the move back to a polymer TIM is a step backwards for the company 's products . Intel 's Coffee Lake Refresh reintroduced the superior soldered TIM to the delight of overclockers and PC enthusiasts . Beyond an audience of hardcore fans , we 've seen soldered TIMs reduce peak temperatures by 10 degrees Celsius , going from the Intel Core i7-8700K to and Core i9-9900K . This is especially impressive considering that the latter Coffee Lake Refresh processor featured two more cores than its closest predecessor . Going back to thermal grease to transfer heat between the processor dies and the integrated heatsink – in other words , the top cover of the CPU – would likely lead to higher temperatures once again .

If you were wondering just how good Intel ’ s incoming Gen11 integrated graphics will be , then this leaked game benchmark offers an indication of the potential power on tap . This comes from that seemingly never-ending source of GPU leaks , TUM_APISAK , who revealed the ( alleged ) Ashes of the Singularity benchmark result on Twitter . pic.twitter.com/AVtjfw0W6uMarch 21 , 2019 As you can see , on the low preset at 1080p resolution , Gen11 apparently notches up a score of 1,400 , which is double that achieved by Intel ’ s UHD Graphics 620 . As Wccftech , which spotted the tweet , points out , this also puts it at roughly the same power level as Nvidia ’ s GeForce MX130 laptop GPU , which can comfortably cope with the likes of Overwatch on moderate graphics settings . The thing to bear in mind here is that , assuming this benchmark isn ’ t a fabrication , it will be based on an early engineering sample as opposed to the finished product , and the drivers will be in a similarly pre-production state . So we can expect a speedier performance when processors with Gen11 GPUs on-board actually hit the market , and the hardware and software are fully tuned up . This is a fairly exciting early indication of the potential behind Intel ’ s Gen11 , although we should be very careful to temper our expectations , as ever with this sort of speculation . What we do know for sure about Gen11 , which was first revealed by Intel at the end of 2018 , is that it breaks the 1 teraflop barrier , and bristles with 64 enhanced execution units ( compared to 24 with Intel ’ s previous Gen9 graphics ) . Gen11 will also usher in Intel ’ s Adaptive Sync , frame-rate smoothing tech in the same vein as AMD ’ s FreeSync or Nvidia ’ s G-Sync . All of which should bring a much improved gaming experience to laptops that rely on integrated graphics . Also worth noting is that at GDC 2019 earlier this week , we caught an initial glimpse of Intel ’ s incoming discrete graphics card .

While Intel spent the majority of its stage time at GDC 2019 announcing new software and 9th Generation mobile processors , the company also gave us a small tease of what its graphics card could look like . At the very start of its GDC 2019 keynote , Intel designer and artist Christiano Siquera shared the very first shroud design for an Intel Graphics Card . This design you see below was apparently published back in December 2018 and while it looks like any old , generic mini GPU , Team Blue has since moved onto a new design . On the next slide above is Intel 's new shroud design with an aesthetic very similar to the company ’ s recent Intel Optane SSDs . Between the flared , diagonal lines and the angular look , this graphics card basically looks like a shorter , bulkier version of the Intel Optane SSD 905P . Intel ’ s first graphics card also seems destined to utilize a single fan , blower-style cooler based on these images . Unfortunately , there ’ s little else to speculate on aside from these observations . As these are just renders and Siquera noted that he ’ s working on nine additional designs , so this likely won ’ t be the final form of Intel ’ s future graphics card . Additional reporting and images by Nick Pino
Intel didn ’ t announce any graphics cards at GDC 2019 , but the company has announced yet another platform in preparation for them as well as its incoming family of 9th Generation mobile processors . Meet the Intel Graphics Command Center ( IGCC ) , Team Blue 's equivalent of Nvidia ’ s GeForce Experience and AMD ’ s Radeon Software . Like other graphics software focused suites , Command Center ’ s features include automatic game detection and one-click game optimization . To help users understand how specific settings are affecting in-game graphics , the software will show before-and-after images . Initially the Graphics Command Center will only support integrated Intel graphics inside the brand 's processors – with the exception of Intel 's new KF-series CPUs , of course – because it 's the only type of graphics Intel currently offers . IGCC will also only support Intel processors that are at least 6th Generation Skylake or newer . However , considering how few users play games with integrated graphics only , we suspect Intel is laying the ground work for future Intel Graphics Cards as well as the company 's highly anticipated Gen11 graphics , which are said to give iGPUs a real shot in the arm . The Intel Graphics Command Center is now available in an early access state to all users and you can download it here . Intel also used some of its time on the GDC 2019 main stage to introduce new 9th Generation mobile processors for laptops – though without naming any specific chips . Rather than debut some actual model names or specs , the Santa Clara-based corporation simply proclaimed that its 9th Gen Intel Core high performance mobile ( H-Series ) processors will power the ultimate laptops for gamers and creators . Additionally , Intel detailed 9th Generation mobile processors will add support Wi-Fi 6 AX200 , Intel Optane memory and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity . Aside from that , Intel hasn ’ t shared any in-depth details about its new 9th Generation mobile lineup , but we can at least infer that these CPUs will be built from yet another iteration of the company ’ s 14nm+ process as Coffee Lake Refresh and Basin Falls Refresh processors . Earlier last month , Intel spilled the beans on its whole 9th Generation Mobile family of mobile processors and they are as follows . Bear in mind that none of these models or their exact specifications have been announced officially yet , so treat this chart above as early conjecture for now . Intel has told us it plans on launch its new 9th Generation H-series CPUs in Q2 2019 ( so sometime in April , May and June ) .

Intel is forging ahead with 10nm Ice Lake and Lakefield processors , but the company might not be done with 14nm CPUs just yet . Apparently , Intel intends to release Cascade Lake ( LGA 3647 ) processors in April and Cascade Lake-X ( LGA 2066 ) at Computex 2019 according to an informed forum poster on the Chiphell boards . The former will purportedly be the next iteration of Xeon chips and the latter may shake out to become the successor to Intel 's current line of high-end desktop chips , Basin Falls Refresh . Cascade Lake ( LGA 3647 ) : AprilCascade Lake-X ( LGA 2066 ) : COMPUTEX 2019 2019Intel / AMD10C Skylake ( Comet Lake ? ) / 12C Zen218C Cascade Lake-X & 28C Skylake-X ( W-3175X ? ) / 32C Threadripper❓March 10 , 2019 This all sounds par for the course for Intel , and these CPU architectures have been rumored time and time again . What ’ s more , Intel itself announced that it has began shipping its next-generation Intel Xeon processors , code-named “ Cascade Lake , ” at the tail end of 2018 and was aiming for broad availability by the first half of this year . So these rumors are at least half right so far . We ’ re a bit disappointed that the report suggests Cascade Lake-X will stick to a 14nm++ process , but at the very least it ’ s an extremely mature process , which should allow for some extremely fast clock speeds .

Update : An Intel spokesperson has provided us with the following statement on the Spoiler vulnerability : “ Intel received notice of this research , and we expect that software can be protected against such issues by employing side channel safe software development practices . This includes avoiding control flows that are dependent on the data of interest . “ We likewise expect that DRAM modules mitigated against Rowhammer style attacks remain protected . Protecting our customers and their data continues to be a critical priority for us and we appreciate the efforts of the security community for their ongoing research . ” Original story follows below… There ’ s another nasty speculative execution hole in Intel ’ s processors – similar to the infamous Spectre vulnerability – which goes by the name of Spoiler . The flaw was highlighted in a research report written by computer scientists at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts , and the University of Lübeck in Germany , who made it clear that while this vulnerability runs along the same lines as Spectre attacks , it works differently – which makes it more dangerous . The paper observes : “ Spoiler is not a Spectre attack . The root cause for Spoiler is a weakness in the address speculation of Intel ’ s proprietary implementation of the memory subsystem which directly leaks timing behavior due to physical address conflicts . Existing spectre mitigations would therefore not interfere with Spoiler . ” However , like Spectre , this vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the way the PC ’ s memory works to glimpse data from running programs and potentially other critical data which should otherwise not be accessible . Note that Spoiler only affects Intel silicon – that ’ s all processors from first-gen Core models and onwards – and not AMD or ARM chips which the researchers also tried to exploit . As the Register reports , any attacker would need some kind of foothold on your PC to drive the exploit , such as malware , or potentially a piece of malicious JavaScript running on a dodgy website . And worryingly , the researchers believe that not only is Spoiler unaffected by any existing countermeasures for the likes of Spectre , but that it can ’ t be easily mitigated against without , in their words , “ significant redesign work at the silicon level ” . So it seems like this is a threat Intel will have to be seriously evaluating with a view to baking in protection when designing upcoming chips . As we already mentioned , the exploit is a danger to all of Intel ’ s Core processors from the first-generation models onwards , and it works against all operating systems , and also can be leveraged from within virtual machines or sandboxes . Spoiler isn ’ t an acronym , and doesn ’ t stand for anything , except the first two letters ‘ sp ’ which refer to ‘ speculative ’ execution – and of course it also underlines the fact that this nasty critter could really spoil your day . In recent times , speculative execution vulnerabilities have come to be viewed as a new class of highly dangerous threats , and the likes of Microsoft have already implemented bug bounty schemes to try to detect and stamp out such flaws before they can be exploited on a wider level .

Intel is continuing the journey of rounding out its Coffee Lake Refresh processor ( CPU ) family with a new slew of high-performance mobile CPUs . Anyone looking for high-power CPUs in laptops will likely be looking at computers powered by these new models in the near future . Intel is simultaneously expanding its lineup of 9th-generation Intel Core desktop processors alongside the launch of the high-performance , H-Series of 9th-gen Intel Core mobile processors . These new mobile processors are indicated with the suffix ' H ' or 'HK ' . These new CPUs are targeted at a growing crowd of PC gamers as well as at creators looking for high-performance internals for stylishly designed computers . While a 45W TDP for all of the new mobile processors may prevent them from showing up in the thinnest and lightest notebooks , they can definitely end up in larger , productivity-focused devices . Intel Core i9-990HK – 2.4/5.0GHz base/boost | 8/16 cores/threads | 45W TDP | 16MB Intel Smart Cache | Overclocking Intel Core i9-9980H – 2.3/4.8GHz base/boost | 8/16 cores/threads | 45W TDP | 16MB Intel Smart Cache Intel Core i7-9850H – 2.6/4.6GHz base/boost | 6/12 cores/threads | 45W TDP | 12MB Intel Smart Cache | Partially unlocked Intel Core i7-9750H – 2.6/4.5GHz base/boost | 6/12 cores/threads | 45W TDP | 12MB Intel Smart Cache Intel Core i5-9400H – 2.5/4.3GHz base/boost | 4/8 cores/threads | 45W TDP | 8MB Intel Smart Cache Intel Core i5-9300H – 2.4/4.1GHz base/boost | 4/8 cores/threads | 45W TDP | 8MB Intel Smart Cache At the high-end of the spectrum , Intel is launching the Intel Core i9-9980HK and the Core i9-9980H . Both are monsters for mobile , with eight cores , 16 threads , and a single-core boost speed of 5GHz for the former and 4.8GHz for the latter . For the i9-9980HK , overlocking is available to push performance to the limit . Intel is also launching two Core i7 and two Core i5 models in the mobile H-Series . But , unsurprisingly , there 's no mention of a Core i3 model getting the H-Series treatment . Arriving with the new CPUs is support for the new Wi-Fi standard : Wi-Fi 6 . This allows for greater overall bandwidth , reduced network latency and more simultaneously connected devices . The new H-Series CPUs all support Intel 's Optane memory , which means they 'll be able to take advantage of the new Optane Memory H10 that combines large SSD capacities with a substantial amount of Optane memory to boost overall performance in a way similar to how hybrid hard drives combined a small amount of flash storage with a hard drive to boost speeds . Alongside the new mobile CPUs , Intel has revealed more than 20 additional CPUs for desktops . These range from some new high-end entries in the Core i9 and Core i7 series ( without overclocking ) down to dual-core Pentium and Celeron processors . Notable among the new desktop CPUs are the T-Series processors . We 'd previously spotted a leak on Intel T-Series processors , and the release confirms the details of that leak . All of the new T-series processors have a low TDP of 35W , making them strong options for smaller , quieter desktop builds . All told , Intel 's new processors hold a lot of potential for mobile and small-form-factor PCs , even if they 'll have to contend with AMD 's upcoming 7-nanometer chips .

Intel is abandoning plans to build 5G modems for smartphones after it reportedly missed a number of deadlines for development of a chip that would have powered the first next generation iPhone next year . Apple was apparently so concerned about delays to the XMM 8160 5G modem chip that it was considering alternative suppliers . Court records showed it had explored the possibility of using Samsung and MediaTek components , while Huawei had thrown its hat into the ring . Now it is confirmed Apple will have to find another supplier for 5G . Intel says it will continue to meet customer commitments for 4G smartphones , such as the iPhone , but does not expect to launch any 5G smartphone products – including those it had planned to launch in 2020 . Intel Bob Swan added that the company would conduct an assessment of the opportunities for 4G and 5G modems in PCs , IoT and other devices and would continue to invest in 5G infrastructure . “ We are very excited about the opportunity in 5G and the ‘ cloudification ’ of the network , but in the smartphone modem business it has become apparent that there is no clear path to profitability and positive returns , ” he said . “ 5G continues to be a strategic priority across Intel , and our team has developed a valuable portfolio of wireless products and intellectual property . We are assessing our options to realize the value we have created , including the opportunities in a wide variety of data-centric platforms and devices in a 5G world . ” Intel had fought hard to win Apple ’ s modem business , even agreeing to terms which meant the iPhone manufacturer had to prioritised over other customers . Qualcomm ’ s modem technology has been used in several iterations of the iPhone , but since the iPhone 7 , Apple has diversified its supplier base , using Intel chips in some handsets . Qualcomm believes its modems have been completely eliminated from the most recent iPhones , a belief that is supported by independent teardowns . This led to a series of legal battles in which Qualcomm claimed Apple violated its patents , while Apple says the Snapdragon chipmaker is abusing its dominant position in the market and charging extortionate fees . But in a surprising parallel development , Apple and Qualcomm have agreed to settle all outstanding litigation in their seemingly never-ending worldwide legal battle . The two parties have even agreed to extend licensing and chip supply contracts . This paves the way for Qualcomm to supply 5G modems to Apple for its 5G iPhone .

It 's been just over a year since Intel 's 8th-generation Coffee Lake processors ( CPU ) got low-powered T-Series variants . Now , with the Coffee Lake Refresh in full swing , it makes sense to expect low-power versions . It appears that may be exactly what is coming , according to leaks compiled by Hexus . A series of leaks detailed the names , specs and thermal design power ( TDP ) levels of various T-Series processors . An important aspect for low-power builds is that TDP , which all of the new T-Series processors appear to share at a low 35W . This is identical to what the 8th-gen T-Series processors offered , allowing for smaller desktop builds with lower-wattage power supplies and less robust cooling . The trade-off that 's made for a lower TDP is readily apparent when considering the other key specs . According to the leaks , the T-Series will have core counts and cache equal to the non-T-series CPUs , but will have largely reduced base and boost clock speeds . The leak shows the following CPUs with details on specs : Core i9-9900T , Core i7-9700T , Core i5-9600T , Core i5-9500T , Core i5-9400T , Core i3-9300T and Core i3-9100T . For a comparison between the standard variety and T-Series , we 'll put the Core i9-9900T next to the Core i9-9900K . The Core i9-9900T is suggested to have a base clock of 2.1GHz and boost clock of 4.4GHz . That compares to the Core i9-9900K 's 3.6GHz base clock and 5.0GHz boost clock . So , while the T-series in this case has a TDP of about 36 % that of the K-Series , its base performance will be significantly lower . Still , these processors can be a strong pick for computer builders looking to create compact machines with power and cooling requirements closer to laptops than traditional desktops . All of the new T-Series processors are listed as coming with Intel UHD Graphics 630 included , so desktops built using these CPUs wo n't need dedicated graphics cards . Of course , computer builders looking for efficient CPUs may also consider waiting for Intel 's long-anticipated 10nm CPUs , which could come in the form of Cannon Lake or Ice Lake this year .

Remember that Intel ’ s Core i9-9990XE , a monster 14-core processor capable of hitting 5GHz across those many cores , was only supposed to be sold by private auction , and not at retail ? Well , a German retailer is now flogging this powerful CPU online as a standalone product . Caseking has stock of the Core i9-9990XE and you can grab one of the chips for the bargain price of €2,999 ( around £2,600 , $ 3,400 , or AU $ 4,700 ) . Come on – you didn ’ t think it would be cheap , now , did you ? Previously at the aforementioned secret auctions the processor has apparently sold for something like $ 2,300 ( around £1,760 , AU $ 3,200 ) , at least in one reported case . Note that Caseking is just selling the bare chip , as opposed to a boxed processor with an included cooler and other bits and bobs , which you would normally get when buying an Intel CPU at retail . The Core i9-9990XE runs at a base clock of 4GHz with Turbo across all 14-cores to 5GHz , plus you get single-core boost to 5.1GHz . It is an extremely nippy Skylake-X offering which is unlocked so it can be overclocked to achieve even better performance ( particularly with a top-end cooling solution , of course ) . We heard previously , from a firm that bought the 9990XE at auction , that the chip managed to rack up a score of 3,732 in the Cinebench multi-core test , which is slightly faster than the 3,640 points Intel ’ s Core i9-9980XE racked up in our testing ( this is only one benchmark , though ) . The latter is the step-down model in Intel ’ s Skylake-X range , which has more cores at 18 , but a slower clock speed at 3GHz base with boost to 4.4GHz ( 4.5GHz single-core ) . Doubtless the extra clock speed could be worthwhile if you want the absolute fastest Skylake-X model , but you do pay a premium for it – the 9980XE retails for about £1,850 ( around $ 2,400 , AU $ 3,400 ) in the UK , so it ’ s almost 30 % cheaper than the 9990XE . The Core i9-9990XE also runs hot nearly all of the time , by all accounts , which isn ’ t exactly surprising given how hard Intel is pushing the clocks over this many cores ( the processor has a TDP of 255W , compared to 165W for the 9980XE , so it gulps over 50 % more power ) . Still , there will no doubt be enthusiast PC builders with no shortage of cash who fancy building a rig around a very , very fast – and still pretty exclusive – CPU , to show off if nothing else . Caseking doesn ’ t indicate how much stock it ’ s carrying , but the processors are still available to purchase at the time of writing . The German retailer is also selling the King Mod CKPC-843 super-high-end PC designed for performance gaming and streaming , which is actually two-machines-in-one , the primary system being built around the 9990XE . It ’ s priced more like a car than a PC , though , at €13,000 ( around £11,200 , $ 14,700 , or AU $ 20,500 ) . Via Tom 's Hardware

The PC market is declining , which is hardly an unfamiliar narrative – despite some signs of recovery in 2018 – but the latest twist is that Intel ’ s processor shortage is apparently contributing more and more to slumping computer sales . However , where Intel is losing ground , AMD is making gains ( as we ’ ve seen in other recent reports – more on that later ) . The two major analyst firms when it comes to PC sales , Gartner and IDC , have both observed a considerable drop in the latest quarter ’ s figures . Gartner ’ s statistics show that global PC shipments for the first quarter of 2019 dropped by 4.6 % year-on-year , settling at around 58.5 million units . IDC measured a slightly smaller impact with a 3 % drop , albeit reaching the same figure of 58.5 million shipments as Gartner . That said , IDC observed that even though a decline is hardly good news , the market did perform better than forecasted , in particular with stronger than anticipated desktop PC shipments , particularly on the commercial side ( the overall PC figures take into account not just desktop computers , but also laptops and workstations ) . The most interesting part of these reports , arguably , is highlighting Intel ’ s share of the blame when it comes to the PC market slump . Gartner ’ s senior principal analyst , Mikako Kitagawa , said that Intel ’ s CPU supply shortage “ affected the vendor competitive landscape as leading vendors had better allocation of chips and also began sourcing alternative CPUs from AMD . ” She further observed : “ The top three vendors worldwide were still able to increase shipments despite the [ CPU ] supply constraint by focusing on their high-end products and taking share from small vendors that struggled to secure CPUs . ” IDC also contended that there ’ s been a shift in the PC market towards more premium ( and business ) products , and that the “ shortage of Intel processors , mostly at the lower end , remained a factor in seeing a contraction in 1Q19 ” , but also that : “ Furthermore , more PC brands turned to AMD chips . ” Both analyst firms are echoing each other to quite a degree here , which is definitely interesting , but not really surprising given what else we ’ ve heard recently concerning the processor world . Namely that Intel ’ s production problems and CPU shortages have led the firm to concentrate on higher-end processors , because this simply makes financial sense – if something ’ s got to give , it has to be the more affordable models , simply because there ’ s less profit margin . It ’ s damage limitation , in other words : if production volume is down , at least profits won ’ t be as far down . And it ’ s common sense that if Intel can ’ t provide , then AMD will try to fill any gaps , and has been doing according to the most recent figures regarding CPU sales we ’ ve come across . These show that AMD ’ s Ryzen processors are now selling twice as fast as Intel ’ s chips , and have been doing for a while ( Intel ’ s CPU production problems have been ongoing for some time ) . That said , the light at the end of the tunnel is allegedly in sight for Intel , with the company previously claiming that these manufacturing woes will be resolved by the end of the second quarter ( ie by the time June rolls around ) .

We had heard at CES 2019 that Intel was working to combine it 's Optane memory with its solid state storage , and now we 've got even more details on the new product that can make even the best gaming PC even better . It may be a mouthful , but the Intel Optane Memory H10 With Solid State Storage looks to do for solid state drives what solid-state hybrid drives ( SSHDs ) did for traditional hard drives . The Intel Optane Memory H10 pairs a chunk of higher speed memory with a considerable piece of QLC 3D NAND flash storage . As QLC NAND lets Intel fit more storage into a small space , it can combine high-capacity NAND with its Optane memory onto a single M.2 drive . In terms of what will initially be available , Intel has listed three SKUs , with a 16GB Optane + 256GB storage , a 32GB Optane + 512GB storage , and a 32GB Optane + 1TB storage . The form factor and high storage capacity make it a compelling option for small form factor PCs and laptops , where drive bays and PCIe slots may be extremely limited and where upgrades to RAM may not be an option either . The new drives are focused on boosting both responsiveness and capacity . The combination of QLC 3D NAND SSD with Intel Optane Memory is furthered along by smart software that can automatically learn your computing behavior to help accelerate your use . If that sounds a lot like what SSHDs do , that 's because it 's very similar , except with even faster storage and memory . The Optane memory and 3D NAND storage have individual controllers , and the drives boast sequential read/write performance of up to 2,400/1,800 MB/s . 4K QD1 Random read/write speeds hit up to 32K/30K IOPS , which tops the Samsung 970 Evo Plus for write , but not for random read or sequential performance . In many cases , those random read/write speeds improve considerably as the queue depth increases to QD2 . Intel identifies a queue depth of QD1 or QD2 as the point where most application workloads operate , so it has highlighted the drives performance in that range . The company claims the new drives offer substantial improvements over the excellent Intel 760p Series SSD in multitasking situations , with documents launching twice as fast and games and large media files launching 60 % and 90 % faster , respectively . The drives will initially be available in the US in the second quarter through Best Buy OEMs , which includ Dell , HP , and Asus , with more stores and OEMs coming . We 've asked Intel about UK and Australia availability details , and will update this piece once we learn more . For system builders , the listed system requirements are 8th-Gen Intel Core U series processors , an Intel 300 Series Chipset On-Package PCH , Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver 17.2 , and a PCIe M.2 slot . It 's unclear when they 'll be sold individually to consumers , though , or if there will eventually be compatibility with other CPUs and chipsets .

AMD is still well and truly dominating Intel in the processor world , selling more than twice as many chips as its rival according to one retailer . The latest stats from German retailer Mindfactory , for the month of March , pegged AMD as selling 69 % of all CPUs , meaning Intel only held a 31 % market share . This is a familiar story by now , as if you rewind six months to the retailer ’ s September 2018 figures , AMD held almost two-thirds ( 65 % ) of the market . And that has increased slightly since , with AMD at 69 % in November , shifting 16,000 units compared to Intel which managed just under 8,000 sales . In these most recent March statistics , AMD sold around 13,000 units compared to Intel ’ s 6,000 , opening up the gulf even further . Of course , we can ’ t judge the overall market based on sales figures from one single retailer , but it does give us a fair idea of the lay of the land , and we can also take the historical perspective into account . In recent times , Intel ’ s sales have remained relatively flat at Mindfactory , whereas AMD has picked up huge momentum , selling twice as many CPUs in November 2018 as it did in November 2017 . As Wccftech , which highlighted the figures , points out , this is now the third quarter in a row in which AMD has outsold Intel ’ s chips , making the former ’ s domination of the market pretty clear-cut ( at least from this relatively limited perspective ) . AMD has clearly been buoyed by its competitively priced Ryzen processors , and equally , Intel has been held back by production difficulties with its latest silicon – particularly stock shortages of more affordable CPUs ( with its manufacturing issues , Intel has chosen to focus more on high-end models , as they carry more of a profit margin ) . Which was the best-selling processor of all at Mindfactory ? That would be the Ryzen 5 2600 six-core CPU , the 2600X spin of which is our pick for best mid-range processor currently . Intel ’ s top-selling chip was the mighty Core i9-9900K , believe it or not , despite its cost , which reinforces what we were saying earlier about the firm ’ s shortage of low-end CPUs . Therefore it ’ s not particularly surprising to hear that if you compare revenue rather than unit sales , AMD is only just in the lead , accounting for 54 % of the money flowing into the German retailer ’ s coffers . So Intel is barely behind in terms of profit rather than pure numbers of CPUs shifted .

Microsoft has quietly released a new version of its Surface Book 2 laptop that comes with an 8th generation Intel Core i5 processor , something we 'd heard rumors of earlier this month . This version sits between the entry-level Surface Book 2 with an older 7th generation Intel Core i5 processor , and the high-end version with an 8th generation Intel Core i7 processor and discrete Nvidia graphics card . The 8th generation Core i5 processor in the new mid-range Surface Book 2 is a quad-core affair , as opposed to the 7th gen Core i5 processor in the entry-level , which is only dual-core . This should make the new Surface Book 2 variant much better at multi-tasking , and an overall better performer . The new version of the Surface Book 2 comes with 8GB of RAM , 256GB PCIe SSD storage and a 13.5-inch display . It costs $ 1,499 , which is $ 200 ( around £200/AU $ 280 ) more than the version with a 7th generation Core i5 processor . At the moment , this version is only available in the US , but hopefully it will arrive in the UK and Australia soon . Microsoft also has a 15-inch Surface Book 2 , but so far , the 8th generation Core i5 processor is only available for the 13-inch version . Via MSPoweruser

Intel has certainly been busy at Computex 2019 , and while many companies have been showing off their latest gadgets at the event in Taiwan , Intel has its eyes firmly fixed on the future . At its Technology Open House event at Computex , the company highlighted its top five innovations which it says will drive “ the next wave of computing , ” and have the potential to radically change the way we use our PCs and laptops . According to Jim Johnson , Intel corporate vice president and general manager of Client Engineering , “ At Computex , Intel is demonstrating its ability to create the platform of the future , with key initiatives such as Project Athena bringing AI to the PC and continuing to lead the way in transforming the PC ecosystem . ” The way laptops look and behave hasn ’ t changed much in their 40-year history , but Intel is looking to radically change that with its new form factor concept , code-named “ Honeycomb Glacier ” . According to Intel , this will give “ new experiences for gamers and creators . ” Honeycomb Glacier laptops will achieve this thanks to a built-in second screen that will offer extra space to play and create with . According to Intel , this will offer “ more immersive gaming experiences by making key information persistent on the companion screen to access things like level maps , inventories , status and more with no applications overlapping your game play or switching between applications . ” Creators who like to stream their gameplay on Twitch can use the second screen to interact with their audience in real-time . Intel is working with laptop manufacturers to bring laptops with dual screens and Intel 9th generation Core processors to the market – and we ’ ve already got a glimpse of one with the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo , which was also shown off at Computex 2019 . Honeycomb Glacier laptops will also feature new Wi-Fi 6 technology for improved network speeds . Intel also showed off its ambient PC prototype ( code-named `` Mohawk River '' ) , which shows how the company is aiming to make computers that are more immersive , connected and intelligent . This means they will always be on and ready to use , will be able to intelligently anticipate the needs of its users with various sensors that can detect when their users are nearby ( using technology such as Windows Hello ) , as well using 180-degree cameras , exterior secondary displays and Intel local voice ID . Ambient compute laptops will also remain active and connected when their lids are closed and will offer a seamless transition when they are opened and closed , and they will also offer advanced video conferencing features . At Computex 2019 , Intel announced a collaboration with Microsoft and Asus to launch the world 's first AI on PC Development Kit , which will bring another new laptop form factor that focuses on Artificial Intelligence aimed at helping developers create AI applications . They ’ ll be released in July 2019 , and will feature Intel processors and integrated graphics , as well as an Intel Movidius Myriad X VPU that specialises in high-performance , low-power AI workloads . Intel states that the “ three hardware engines will run a diverse range of AI workloads to deliver a comprehensive breadth of raw AI capability for laptops today . ” The AI on PC Development Kit laptops will have pre-installed software that will make it quick and easy to develop and deploy AI apps . Intel also unveiled the Intel NUC Compute Element , which is a barebones modular PC that comes with Intel hardware and can be configured to run mini PCs , set top boxes , kiosks and more . We ’ re big fans of Intel ’ s previous NUC devices , and the NUC Compute Element will offer a big leap in performance , while remaining relatively low cost and easy to upgrade . The NUC Compute Element will come with a choice of Intel processors and will be available in the first half of 2020 . Finally , Intel showed off its Intel Optane memory M15 , which is the next generation of its Optane memory , offering higher performance and lower power consumption than previous generations . Available in the third quarter of 2019 , Intel Optane M15 has been designed to work especially well with 9th generation Intel Core processors for short boot times and fast performance when loading apps and games . So , it looks like Intel has big plans for the future . That ’ s just as well , as in our view it ’ s Intel ’ s rival , AMD , that ’ s dominating Computex 2019 so far .

AMD has made big waves at Computex by showing off its Ryzen 3rd Generation and Epyc processors ( not to mention Navi graphics cards ) , and Wall Street analysts appear to agree with the general sentiment that these products are going to cause even more trouble for Intel . AMD ’ s Ryzen chips have already gone from strength to strength of late , and have capitalized on Intel ’ s manufacturing woes , and although the latter production issues should be resolved soon – Intel has mentioned that everything should be smoothed over by the third quarter – analysts still believe AMD currently holds all the processor cards with its incoming 7nm ( Zen 2 ) CPUs . Kevin Cassidy , a semiconductor equities analyst at Stifel , reaffirmed his ‘ buy ’ rating for AMD and said that : “ [ Zen 2 will allow AMD ] to accelerate its PC market share gains due to higher performance , lower power usage , lower cost and ease of upgrade . ” Cassidy further noted : “ This announcement represents the first time AMD has taken the desktop CPU process-technology and performance lead from Intel in its 50-year history . ” Matthew Ramsey , an analyst from Cowen who deals with the semiconductor arena , observed : “ Our team attended CEO Lisa Su ’ s Computex keynote Monday in Taipei that highlighted several 7nm products set to launch over the next six months across all of AMD ’ s served markets . We anticipate these products will drive above-consensus growth , share gains , margin expansion and AMD share appreciation . ” Ramsey highlighted Epyc server processors in particular , anticipating that AMD will do ‘ very well ’ in the data center market and cloud computing with those heavyweight 7nm chips , and currently has an ‘ outperform ’ rating on AMD ’ s stock . Ramsey also felt AMD stole the show at Computex , as MarketWatch reports , and we are in agreement with that following our detailed coverage of the event . Clearly , then , Intel needs to fight back and regain some momentum , because as we ’ ve seen of late , CPU sales seem to be heavily in favor of AMD ( with Ryzen chips selling twice as many as Intel ’ s , no less , at least according to figures from one retailer ) . Perhaps unsurprisingly , AMD ’ s stock shot up almost 10 % yesterday , and the company will be feeling pretty good about things no doubt , particularly on the processor front . Naturally , we ’ ll only know exactly how good these Ryzen 3rd Generation CPUs are when we get them in for testing , though . Equally , on the GPU front , the hope is that Navi ( Radeon RX 5000 range ) will also be able to grab some turf back from Nvidia ’ s GeForce graphics cards , with AMD claiming an incoming RX 5700 offering will outdo the RTX 2070 to the tune of around 10 % . Again , we shall just have to see if those promised performance levels stack up , and of course pricing will be key . Via Wccftech

Intel has finally announced that 10nm Ice Lake processors for laptops are shipping now , and should arrive in the best laptops and Ultrabooks later this year . This comes after years of pushing back 10nm chips – Intel first announced its Cannon Lake lineup back in 2016 . But now Ice Lake is on the way , as part of Intel 's Project Athena , announced at Computex 2019 , which Team Blue claims will push computing to the next level . Project Athena is a multi-year initiative that will see Intel pushing to advance computing in several key areas , including performance , battery life , connectivity and form factor . The idea seems to be to make computing as accessible as using a mobile phone , with the 'instant action ' element designed to enable computers wake up from sleep in under a second . Intel Ice Lake 10th-generation processors are just the first part of Project Athena , and will work towards achieving these long-term computing goals . These new chips will be based on the Sunny Cove architecture announced back at CES 2019 , and will include features like WiFi 6 and much more powerful Intel Gen11 graphics . These chips are also unique in that they will integrate WiFi 6 and Thunderbolt 3 into the SoC , which will boost compatibility and should lead to even thinner and ligher laptops . As for specs , Intel Ice Lake processors will range from Core i3 to Core i7 and feature up to 4-cores and 8-threads , with turbo boost speeds up to 4.1GHz . And , notably , we 'll see GPU clock speeds up to 1.1GHz , which should double previous generations ' integrated graphics performance . These integrated GPUs will be capable of 4K HDR video and might even be capable of playing some AAA PC games like Destiny 2 . Intel did n't forget about desktop products , though . Team Blue is refreshing the Intel Core i9-9900K with the Core i9-9900KS , which will get a turbo speed boost to 5GHz on all cores , which should give the newly announced AMD Ryzen 9 3900X some competition . If you want to get your hands on this beefy processor , you 'll be able to get your hands on it towards the end of this year . To complement this new processor is a new suite of overclocking tools for enthusiasts , called the Intel Performance Maximizer , or IPM . This is an automated overclocking tool , which will let brave enthusiasts push their unlocked K-series processors to the limit . And , do n't worry , you can still manually fine-tune your overclocks through this tool . For enthusiasts who really want extreme performance we 're getting new Intel Core-X processors , through a new generation of HEDT processors . We do n't have exact specs for these HEDT processors , but Intel is claiming that we 'll see improved clock speeds and Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 , which will apparently let more than two cores boost up to the max clocks . Finally , Intel released 9th-gen Intel Core VPro processors for mobile and desktop , aimed at business professionals , which feature baked-in security features that business demand . For instance , if something goes wrong , IT professionals can gain remote access at the hardware level . These high performance processors for businesses will feature up to eight cores and 16 threads . Image credits : TechRadar Check out all of TechRadar 's Computex 2019 coverage .

Computex 2019 is right around the corner , and besides massive announcements like the expected release of AMD 's Ryzen 3000 CPUs and Navi graphics cards , plenty of other companies have kit to show . MSI is one of them , as it has upgraded its small form-factor gaming PC , the MSI Trident X , with new internals from Nvidia and Intel . The new MSI Trident X Plus comes alongside upgraded models of two MSI laptops , the GE65 Raider and GT76 Titan . The new Trident model will feature Intel 's 9th-Generation Core i9 processor ( CPU ) and Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics for the best gaming performance , and that 's all going into a 10-liter case . MSI claims this makes the new Trident X Plus the smallest gaming desktop in the world powered by a 9th-Gen Core i9 processor . To keep all those components cool despite their close proximity , the Trident X Plus is designed with MSI 's Silent Storm Cooling 3 technology , which separates the CPU , graphics and power supply to have their own distinct channels for airflow . The previous generation of the Trident X proved to be one of the best gaming PCs , so the new model could have a strong shot at ranking . We 'll have a better idea of just that once MSI releases the pricing and availability information for this bad boy . A gaming desktop is only as good as the peripherals you use it with , and MSI has a whole suite of them to pair with its latest computers . The company has new keyboards and mice coming , but we have n't found the company to offer the best gaming keyboards or best gaming mice in the past . However , it also has a few new monitors on offer , and an earlier MSI Optix monitor ranked among our best gaming monitors . MSI has a new Optix 4K monitor with a 31.5-inch , curved display . It 's positioned as a small TV replacement with FreeSync and sub-10ms input lag . There 's also the super-fast Oculus NXG25R monitor with a Full HD display that boasts a 240Hz refresh rate and a 0.5ms response time . At the more premium end , MSI also has the new Optix MPG341CQR monitor with a wide , curved 3,440 x 1,440 display boasting a 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms of input lag for smooth gaming . It also has a 21:9 aspect ratio for a cinematic experience that 's furthered along by support for HDR with HDR 400 ( we presume this is VESA 's DisplayHDR 400 certification ) . MSI is rounding out its offerings with two new series of PC cases as well . Again , pricing and availability information is not yet available , something we hope to glean from MSI while on the show floor in Taipei .
Computex 2019 is almost here , and with it will come a couple of new gaming laptops from MSI bringing the latest in high performance silicon from Intel and Nvidia . MSI has unveiled the new hardware in a press release ahead of the show in Taipei , where both will be on display from May 28th to June 1 . The new laptops are upgrades to existing lines , with the MSI GE65 Raider stepping up in the thin and light gaming laptop space , while the MSI GT76 Titan upgrades the previous GT75 Titan 's parts . While MSI has selected these two new gaming laptops to highlight , it may have even more in store . It will also be showcasing major updates to its productivity-focused Prestige series . The 17-inch MSI GT76 Titan is coming in hot , but MSI has a new cooling solution to tame the 8-core/16-thread Intel Core i9 processor inside – even as it overclocks to 5.0GHz . The MSI Cooler Boost Titan system will include 11 heat pipes and four fans for serious airflow that should keep the Intel Core i9 and Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics running smoothly no matter what game you 're playing . Meanwhile , the MSI GE65 Raider is keeping things more discrete , with a svelte design compared to its larger sibling . But , it 's still aimed at smooth gaming with a 9th-Gen Intel Core i9 processor , GeForce RTX graphics , and a 15-inch , 240Hz IPS display for fluid visuals . Unfortunately , MSI has not yet revealed pricing and availability details for either of these laptops . We hope to get more information on this during Computex while on the ground . We 'll be keeping a lookout for these laptops when they launch , so we can test them and see how they fair against the best gaming laptops . Considering that the GT75 Titan is already ranked highly , their odds may be good .

ZombieLoad is the latest in a line of high profile security flaws with attention-grabbing names to plague Intel processors , and it seems that many of the chip maker ’ s friends and allies are running out of patience with the company . As with previous security flaws , like Meltdown and Spectre , the disclosure of ZombieLoad , which potentially allows malicious hackers to steal private browsing history , passwords and other information , has lead to companies such as Microsoft , Apple and Google rushing out patches to help mitigate the impact of the errors . Having to work around the clock to fix an issue in another company ’ s product is never going to go down well . And , while Intel ’ s biggest partners have mainly kept diplomatically quiet over their frustrations with having to fix yet another security flaw in Intel ’ s hardware , their engineers must have felt acutely frustrated . Just look at the noise coming from the open source community . Open source developers can talk more freely about their annoyance with Intel and its latest security fail as there are no business relationships that need to be kept sweet , no NDAs to sign or gentlemen ’ s agreements . The open source community isn ’ t well known for biting its tongue when something annoys it . Take the release notes for the Linux kernel 5.1.2 by Greg Kroah-Hartman , the stable Linux kernel maintainer , which was released in the aftermath of ZombieLoad . As he notes , “ As I said before just over a year ago , Intel once again owes a bunch of people a lot of drinks for fixing their hardware bugs in our software . ” There surely are many developers at the bigger tech companies that will be quietly agreeing with him . While many companies released mitigations against ZombieLoad , the problem doesn ’ t end there . Most of the fixes involve disabling hyper-threading , a feature that generates virtualized processor cores for improved multitasking performance , and that has lead to some drastic performance impacts after the patches are applied . If your Mac suddenly starts running slow , you ’ re likely to blame Apple before you blame Intel . For example , Apple revealed that , with the ZombieLoad patch installed , there could be performance drops of up to 40 % – which would particularly impact Macs with multi-core processors . That 's practically every modern Mac in use today . Meanwhile , the Phoronix website has taken a deep dive into what sort of performance impact ZombieLoad mitigations have on Linux machines – and the results aren ’ t good . Not only will this annoy customers who are seeing their expensive devices perform worse , but it ’ s not a good look for the manufacturers , either . If your Mac suddenly starts running slow , you ’ re likely to blame Apple before you blame Intel . It ’ s no secret that Apple has been considering parting ways with Intel and building its own processors to power its Mac devices . After insinuating that Intel ’ s recent processor shortage was responsible for lower Mac sales ( and prompted us to half-jokingly suggest that Apple should buy AMD ) , this new security flaw – and the impact its mitigations have on performance – could further sour Apple and Intel ’ s relationship . So , Intel is fast losing friends . Is there anything it can do ? Well , apart from stop releasing hardware with major security issues in them , that is . With Intel ’ s partners seemingly frustrated with the hardware maker , it surely must be hoping that its Project Athena initiative pays off . If laptop makers and software developers end up falling out with Intel , then we could see them move to Qualcomm and ARM hardware . Project Athena sees Intel working closely with manufacturers to develop the next generation of laptops . While it won ’ t answer many of the problems its partners have , by working more closely together , Intel and companies such as Microsoft , Google and Dell can help shape future hardware that ’ s free from major security exploits . Project Athena should produce laptops that can meet the requirements of modern users : offering always-connected 5G internet , day-long battery life and drastically reduced start-up times . These are all features that Windows on Snapdragon ( WOS ) devices have . WOS laptops run on Qualcomm ’ s Snapdragon hardware – making them a distinct threat to Intel . If laptop makers and software developers end up falling out with Intel , then we could see them move to Qualcomm and other ARM hardware . That means the success of Project Athena is more important than ever for Intel . If it can manage to produce hardware that ’ s free from the major security flaws we ’ ve recently seen , while collaborating with its partners and fighting off competition from Qualcomm and a resurgent AMD , then Project Athena could save Intel . If it can ’ t , then Team Blue could be in a lot of trouble , and it might find its old friends aren ’ t going to be so keen to help it out in the future .

A major vulnerability , known as ZombieLoad , has been discovered that affects nearly every Intel processor made since 2011 . According to a new report by security experts , the ZombieLoad flaw allows potential malicious hackers to steal private browsing history , passwords and other information from affected PCs using a software that exploits four bugs in Intel hardware which researchers apparently reported to the processor maker last month . Make sure you check out our in-depth guide on how to protect your devices against the ZombieLoad attack . A “ zombie load ” is a high amount of data that the processor can not properly handle , which causes the processor to use elements of its microcode to prevent the whole PC crashing . This load can contain sensitive data from apps and programs , and the flaw allows this information to be accessed . The ZombieLoad flaw brings to mind the Meltdown and Spectre bugs that plagues Intel ’ s processors . Like Meltdown and Spectre , ZombieLoad is only thought to affect Intel processors , so devices running on AMD or ARM processors ( such as smartphones and tablets ) shouldn ’ t be vulnerable . While it doesn ’ t seem like ZombieLoad has been used by malicious hackers to steal information yet , the severity of the threat has caused companies such as Apple , Microsoft and Google to release patches to mitigate against the vulnerability . Apple has released a ZombieLoad patch for macOS Mojave 10.14.5 , which applies to every Mac and MacBook released since 2011 , which also includes an update for its Safari internet browser . However , it appears that some Macs may see a 40 % fall in performance if all the patches are applied . That ’ s bound to upset a lot of Mac owners , so let ’ s hope Apple and Intel work on further mitigations that reduce the impact to performance . There will also be a security update for Macs running macOS Sierra and macOS High Sierra as well . iPhones and iPads are not affected . Meanwhile , Google has also released patches to mitigate against ZombieLoad . While most Android devices run on ARM hardware and won ’ t be affected , any Android device using Intel hardware will need to apply the patches . Chromebooks and Chrome OS devices will have already had the ZombieLoad patches applied . Google has also advised users of its Chrome web browser to make sure they install updates from their operating system – so Windows users and Mac users make sure you ’ ve got all the latest updates installed . As we reported earlier , Microsoft has revealed that Windows 7 and XP are vulnerable to ZombieLoad , and it has released patches for all its operating systems which can be installed via Windows Update or from the Microsoft Support website . Mozilla has also said that it is working on a long-term fix for its Firefox web browser for macOS , and Firefox Beta and Firefox Nightly versions have the patch already installed . According to Mozilla , no action is needed for Windows and Linux users of Firefox . We ’ ll be keeping a close eye on ZombieLoad as this story develops . Meltdown and Spectre ended up causing a lot of disruption – and badly damaged Intel ’ s reputation . Let ’ s hope ZombieLoad isn ’ t as problematic . Via TechCrunch

Cascade Lake-X is another iteration of Skylake-X , which was initially released as a response to Threadripper . And , while processors like the Intel Core i9-7980XE and Core i9-9980XE outperform processors like the Ryzen Threadripper 1950X and 2950X , respectively , they ’ re also much more expensive – which leads to more enthusiasts going with AMD ’ s high-end desktop ( HEDT ) platform . Initially , we were expecting Cascade Lake-X to follow Skylake-X directly , but Intel launched Basin Falls Refresh instead . However , rumors lead us to believe that Cascade Lake-X will be the next HEDT platform , even if it will still be on 14nm . In fact , we ’ ve already seen some non-X Cascade Lake processors arrive in the small business-focused Intel Xeon-E lineup , so we can ’ t wait to see what Cascade Lake-X can do . But , just because Cascade Lake is focused on servers these days , doesn ’ t mean it ’ s not exciting , or that the microarchitecture won ’ t turn into HEDT products later on . So , keep this page bookmarked , and we ’ ll keep it updated with all the latest information . Even though we ’ ve finally got word from Intel about Cascade Lake server processors , the release schedule for Cascade Lake-X is kind of a mess . Some Cascade Lake Xeon processors hit the street already , namely the Xeon E-2100 line processors . These chips are aimed at small businesses , with up to 6 cores . There are also some 48-core server grade Cascade Lake processors coming out later this year , according to a report from Ars Technica . We ’ ve also seen a leak from the Chiphell forums that hints at a Cascade Lake-X reveal at Computex 2019 . This leak refers to these new chips as LGA 2066 parts , which would put them in the same league as Intel ’ s new Basin Falls Refresh processors . That ’ s all we know for now , but something tells us that there will be much more to Cascade Lake over the next few months , so stay tuned for all your Cascade Lake release date information . This is where things might get uncomfortable , so brace yourself . Intel doesn ’ t exactly have a history of releasing HCC and HEDT processors for what we would call ‘ reasonable ’ prices . So , we expect the pricing of Cascade Lake-X to fall in line with , or exceed Skylake-X ’ s pricing . However , the early days of Cascade Lake looks reasonable , with the small business-targeted pricing being pretty reasonable . The prices of the Cascade Lake Xeon E-2100 line is as follows : When it comes to the eventual Cascade Lake-X chips , and the Xeon W chip the prices are going to be much higher . So , we ’ ve taken the liberty of listing the pricing of Skylake-X processors below . Assuming for a second that the 28-core CPU showed off at Computex is indicative of what we can expect from Cascade Lake-X , things are about to get bananas . Skylake-X offered significantly higher core counts than the previous generation of HEDT processors because it was manufactured on a smaller die . Cascade Lake-X does n't have the same advantage as it ’ s still based on 14nm++ manufacturing . So while it will be able to offer slightly higher core counts , core clocks and power efficiency than Skylake-X , the leap in performance isn ’ t going to be as breathtaking . Still , Intel could use this process refinement to deliver a better value proposition – maybe offering a 10-core CPU for under $ 1,000 . This could attract plenty of enthusiasts over to this server and enterprise platform , rather than more affordable mainstream CPUs . Intel has finally revealed the Intel Xeon W-3175X , which is a 28-core processor , meant for high-end server solutions . We don ’ t quite know what it ’ s going to be able to do , as it won ’ t be coming out until December 2018 , but we do have specs for the Xeon E-2100 series of processors , which are targeted at small business-grade servers . Those specs are as follows : That ’ s all we know for now , so now we just have to wait for Intel to reveal what ’ s in store – and we ’ ll be sure to update this page the second we know more .
Over the last few years , Intel has run into plenty of renewed competition in the CPU space – the endless war of AMD vs Intel is on in full force . Enter Skylake-X , Intel ’ s answer to AMD ’ s massively successful Ryzen and Threadripper processors . Back in 2017 , when AMD launched Ryzen , Intel was caught by surprise . We didn ’ t know how Intel would respond , at least not at first . There were scattered rumors that Intel would launch Cannon Lake at Computex 2017 , but , of course , that didn ’ t happen . Instead , Intel announced Skylake-X , a line of HEDT processors . But , it worked : Skylake-X , headed by the Intel Core i9-7980XE launched at Computex 2017 , and while we knew it was coming , we were still impressed by the performance . But , the Intel Skylake-X story keeps going . About a year later , in 2018 , Intel announced the new HEDT Basin Falls Refresh processors , like the beastly Intel Core i9-9980XE , based on an improved 14nm architecture , along with a 28-core Xeon W chip to extend the Skylake-X family into 2019 and beyond . Intel released the lower-end Skylake-X processors immediately following their reveal at Computex 2017 with the Core i7-7800X , Core i7-7820X and Core i9-7900X . All of which was released on June 19 , 2017 . Later , Intel launched three more enterprise processors , with the Intel Core i9-7920X , Core i9-7940X and Core i9-7960X all hitting the streets by September 2017 . Later that month , Intel launched the Core i9-7980XE , an absolute unit of a chip that destroyed everything that came up against it . And , now that Kaby Lake-X chips are a thing – or , were a thing when they died unceremoniously – you might be thinking to yourself that all the fun ended with the 7980XE . However , Skylake-X isn ’ t dead yet . Intel also announced a Skylake SP 28-core server chip , which would later be christened the Intel Xeon W-3175X , back at Computex 2018 . Intel ’ s newest addition to this family was officially announced on October 8 , 2018 and release in February 2019 to dethrone Threadripper 2nd Generation . The biggest thing holding Intel Skylake-X chips from an easy recommendation is their price – they ’ re some of the most expensive consumer CPUs you can buy today . If you want to pick up a Core i9 processor for your latest build , you might actually need to sell your car first , as they start out around $ 999 ( about £750 , AU $ 1,340 ) . Now , the Core i7 Skylake X processors are a bit more reasonable , but you ’ re still paying to adopt a high-end platform , so don ’ t expect to base a budget build off of Skylake-X . Below you can find the pricing for all of the Skylake-X processors currently available . We also finally know that the 28-core A-series chip is going to be extremely expensive – if you want to get your hands on the Intel Xeon W-3175X , you ’ re looking at $ 2,999 ( about £2,330 , AU $ 4,250 ) . Get ready to drop at least $ 10,000 if you ’ re planning on building an equally powerful rig around this chip . Intel newest Cascade Lake chip , the Intel Xeon W-3175X , seems to be beyond the realm of these other Skylake-X HEDT chips . With a name like Xeon , this CPU is designed for more enterprise usage than enthusiast overclocking . Although the chip first debuted at Computex 2018 with a 5.0GHz boost clock , it was later revealed that Intel was actually overclocking while immersing the processor in liquid-nitrogen . Without an extreme setup , you 're more likely to see this chip running at a maximum of 4.3GHz . However , the next actual HEDT processors lie within the Basin Falls Refresh lineup . Chips like the Intel Core i9-9980XE are positioned to take on the Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX and Threadripper 2970WX . And , while it is faster , it ’ s still hard to justify the high price . Intel newest Skylake chip , the Intel Xeon W-3175X , is beyond the realm of these other HEDT chips . With the Xeon name , this CPU is designed for more enterprise usage – think 3D animation – than enthusiast overclocking . Although the chip first debuted at Computex 2018 with a 5.0GHz boost clock , it was later revealed that Intel was actually overclocking while immersing the chip in liquid-nitrogen . We finally have the final specs , and it looks like the Intel Xeon W-3175X will have a core clock of 3.1 GHz , with a boost of 3.8GHz across all 28 cores and a 4.3GHz single-core turbo clock . And , with the new Intel C621 chipset , this CPU comes with a greatly expanded support platform . This chip supports 68 PCIe lanes , 6-channel memory for up to 512GB of RAM running at 2,666MHz .

Team Blue has said the chip will support 68 PCIe lanes , 6-channel memory for up to 512GB of RAM running at 2,666MHz . All told , this maybe the processor to finally outpace the Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX and Threadripper 2970WX .
Intel must be feeling the heat from Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered laptops , because the company is now developing its first hybrid processor or system-on-a-chip ( SOC ) . Then there ’ s Intel Lakefield , a processor unlike anything we ’ ve ever seen . It ’ s packed with more than one type of CPU core to create a more stable and better rounded system . Plus , these hybrid SOCs can even come with their own integrated memory , I/O interface , wireless connectivity , and , of course , integrated CPUs . Because it has so many different components built into the chip , Lakefield operates more like the ARM processors found in the best smartphones , than the traditional CPUs that have been powering laptops and desktop computers practically since they were invented.Lakefield could just change the computer game for the first time in years . It ’ s not surprising that Intel isn ’ t the only one chasing the SOC dream , as AMD Ryzen 3rd Generation chips are also architecturally designed to be hybrid processors . Before this new wave of SOCs hits us , here ’ s everything you need to know about Intel Lakefield . So far , all we know is that Lakefield will apparently enter production sometime in 2019 . Intel has also said that it ’ s committed to having 10nm devices on shelves in time for the 2019 holiday shopping season in the US . That will likely be Ice Lake , as Intel has said that platform should be out by the end of the year , but it ’ s possible we ’ ll see Lakefield products by the end of the year , too . However , Intel Lakefield-powered systems might actually come out earlier than that . According to some leaked roadmaps from Tweakers , Lakefield M-series processors may be released in Q2 2019 , which could see a summer release date – just in time for seasonal travel . Pricing on Lakefield processors is going to be really hard to pin down , because as we ’ ve mentioned these will be Intel ’ s first ever hybrid processors . Without any pre-existing chips to use as a point of reference , we don ’ t really have much to base our speculation on . Additionally , it seems like Lakefield will primarily be integrated into laptops and other types of mobile devices , rather than appearing on store shelves as boxed processors . With this in mind , these hybrid CPUs will likely only be available to commercial partners such as system integrators and original device manufacturers – so the chances of you being able to buy standalone Lakefield CPUs are slim . Before we get into the nitty-gritty of the makeup of an Intel Lakefield processor , it ’ s worth discussing the guiding principle or technological revolution behind the company ’ s first hybrid x86 CPU : Foveros . To start this journey , we ’ ll first take a look back at where Intel has been . For the most part , Intel ’ s processors up to now have utilized either monolithic or 2D integration packaging – that is to say , that ’ s how the chips are built . The former process has been used for the bulk of Intel ’ s processors , in which the CPU core , integrated memory , I/O and graphics are all integrated into a single die or unit . Intel recently introduced 2D integration with its Kaby Lake G processors , which placed Intel CPU cores with discrete-class AMD graphics next to each other . Although the two separate components are ultimately built into a single package , they ’ re connected through the use of Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge , which enables high-speed communication . Foveros is essentially an evolution of this 2D integration , in which other components can be stacked on top of each other in a form of logic-on-logic integration . The influence Foveros has had on the design on Intel ’ s Lakefield processor can be easily seen thanks to a recently released video that dissects the hybrid processor . We can clearly see the 12mm square package is stacked like a sandwich , with integrated memory sitting on top of the chip ’ s main components . The CPU itself includes a mix of different cores , including one big 10nm Sunny Cove core for performance and four , smaller 10nm Atom cores for low-energy tasks . This mix of differently performing CPU cores will supposedly allow small-form-factor devices to deliver both performance and power efficiency at the same time . What 's more , this chip comes with Intel ’ s Gen11 integrated graphics , as well as interfaces for cameras and hardwired connections , or I/O – not to mention the integrated memory sitting on top of all these components . Despite their stacked nature , Intel Lakefield processors will still fit into the smallest of devices . At its CES 2019 keynote , Intel demonstrated how its hybrid processor can be fitted onto a motherboard no larger than a Roku Streaming Stick . Intel has said that Lakefield can scale from low-power systems to full PC performance machines . This wide range of devices includes traditional notebooks , 2-in-1 ( convertible or detachable ) laptops , and even dual-screen laptops . Devices similar to the Intel Tiger Rapids and Asus Project Precog could get this new hybrid processor . That ’ s everything we know about Intel Lakefield so far , but we ’ re sure to learn more about Intel ’ s innovative hybrid processor soon . Stay tuned to this page , as we ’ ll be bringing you the latest developments as we learn about them .
Remember how Intel was going to release Cannon Lake in 2016 ? And , then when it got pushed back to 2018 ? Well , according to Intel ’ s Q1 financial results , we won ’ t see the long-awaited follow-up to Kaby Lake until 2019 – at least in a consumer-ready state . Before we get into Cannon Lake , we ’ re going to have to dive into its background , because it gets messy . You see , in the past , Intel has followed a simple ‘ Tick Tock ’ release schedule , where each generation would alternate between introducing a new die process and architecture . This is why we all expected Cannon Lake to succeed Skylake way back in 2016 . Reality is never quite so simple . Intel has repeatedly pushed Cannon Lake , and the rest of its 10nm silicon , back . Since Skylake , Intel has launched Kaby Lake , Coffee Lake and Coffee Lake Refresh , three more refinements of the 14nm process . We ’ re not even sure when Intel will release Cannon Lake , if it ever does . This delay of releasing consumer-focused 10nm processors may actually explain why AMD has claimed more than half of the CPU market . But , at least Intel is sticking to a 2019 release date for its 10nm Ice Lake chips for laptops . Intel keeps denying that Cannon Lake is canceled , but with Ice Lake appearing in the very release window we assumed Cannon Lake would have , it ’ s hard to believe . Plus , Intel has revealed Sunny Cove as its next architecture . Still , we did get a Cannon Lake laptop chip , so we ’ ll keep trying to figure out what Intel is doing . So , be sure to keep this page bookmarked and we ’ ll update it with any new Cannon Lake information . We were supposed to get Cannon Lake twice already . The presumably 9th-generation Intel CPUs were initially supposed to follow Skylake in 2016 , then Kaby Lake in 2018 . But according to Intel ’ s Q1 2018 financial report , it ’ s “ currently shipping low-volume 10nm product and now expects 10nm volume production to shift to 2019. ” So , we ’ re probably not getting Cannon Lake in 2018 . There was some recent speculation that pointed to Intel just cancelling Cannon Lake , because it wasn ’ t financially feasible to shift to 10nm . However , Intel came out and defended itself , saying that it was ‘ making good progress on 10nm ’ and that ‘ yields are improving ’ . So , we just have to see when this smaller manufacturing process makes it to market . But , then we keep getting more and more evidence that Cannon Lake might never see the light of day . Intel just announced its Sunny Cove 10nm microarchitecture , for both server and client processors , for release in late 2019 . So , is Sunny Cove just Cannon Lake rebranded ? Is Cannon Lake cancelled ? Who knows . Either way we ’ ll have to wait until at least 2019 to see Cannon Lake , or whatever it ’ s called now , but when in 2019 ? Well , we don ’ t know yet , but we did get our hands on a leaked Intel roadmap that shows Coffee Lake Refresh being Intel ’ s main platform through Q2 2019 . But , given Intel ’ s recent supply issues , we could see the release pushed back to the latter half of 2019 or even 2020 . Intel probably isn ’ t going to rock the boat too much here . We expect prices to fall in line with the current lineup of 8th-generation Coffee Lake processors . We ’ ve taken the liberty of listing some of the prices here . Unfortunately , we won ’ t know until Intel actually releases pricing information , but between generations , Intel doesn ’ t generally shift its pricing all that much . This is where things are going to get interesting . It ’ s been a very long time since we ’ ve seen a die process shrink at Intel , but when Broadwell succeeded Haswell ( yeah , it ’ s been that long ) , we saw 30 % gains in efficiency . This will mean that battery life in the best laptops will surge , and we ’ ll be able to overclock even harder while keeping temps manageable . Tom ’ s Hardware has reported that a dual-core Cannon Lake CPU was shipped last year according to a Spectre microcode guidance document , but it ’ s highly unlikely that consumer units will be the same . Otherwise , AMD would eat them alive for that . We ’ ll likely see higher core counts , as Intel is going to want to go up against AMD in a major way . This dual-core chip was likely that Intel Core i3 8121U processor that was just listed by Intel . According to the product listing the processor features two-cores and four-threads delivering 2.2GHz of base performance and boost clock of 3.2GHz . It also has a TDP of just 15W and a 4MB cache . And , Anandtech seems to have got its hands on a laptop running that Core i3-8121U for testing – and , well , it ’ s not the next-generation revolution you were expecting . It beat the Kaby Lake Intel Core i3-8130U in some benchmarks , but many of the tests put the Cannon Lake mobile chip behind in power , while consuming more power . We ’ ve also seen a leaked document that suggests a new X399 chipset in the works that would support existing Coffee Lake CPUs and possibly Cannon Lake processors as well , suggesting enthusiasts won ’ t need to upgrade their motherboard to get on the Cannon Lake train . If the newly-announced Intel i7-8086K is any kind of clue as to what we can expect from future Intel products with its 5GHz boost clock , we won ’ t only see high core counts as a result of the move to a 10nm process , but crazy high clock speeds as well . Ultimately , we won ’ t know what performance advantages Cannon Lake CPUs will offer until Intel shares some more information about it , but because it ’ s been pushed back until 2019 . It ’ s likely we won ’ t hear anything from the tech behemoth until Computex 2019 . But , don ’ t worry if anything changes , we ’ ll update this page . So , keep your eyes glued to this page .
Intel Whiskey Lake has been officially launched , and it ’ s the latest line of 8th-Generation mobile processors behind the next generation of laptops . This next-gen mobile architecture was announced back at Computex 2018 alongside the Amber Lake Y-series fanless chips . We ’ re not sure why there are two different mobile microarchitectures , but they ’ re both products of the third refinement of Skylake . Both Whiskey Lake and Amber Lake will take Kaby Lake Refresh ’ s spot as the best processors for laptops and Ultrabooks . But , what about those Coffee Lake U-series processors announced in April 2018 ? Unfortunately , we didn ’ t see many Coffee Lake U-equipped laptops beyond the 13-inch MacBook Pro 2018 . It seems like most laptop manufacturers skipped Coffee Lake U in favor of Whiskey Lake , probably thanks to the minimal improvements over Kaby Lake R. But , there are plenty of Whiskey Lake laptops out there today , like the Huawei MateBook 14 and the Razer Blade Stealth . So , even though Intel is still suffering from supply problems , Whiskey Lake is behind some of the best Ultrabooks out right now , like the new Dell XPS 13 . So , with that in mind , we ’ ll dive into everything Whiskey Lake has to offer . Keep this page bookmarked , and we ’ ll keep it updated with all the latest info . While Whiskey Lake was announced back in 2018 , it wasn ’ t until CES 2019 that we really started to see them show up in actual devices . There are plenty of new devices with Whiskey Lake and Amber Lake chips , like the Dell XPS 13 , the new Asus ZenBooks and the thin and light Acer Swift 7 2019 . And , if you ’ re looking for the more powerful H-series mobile processors , Intel has just released its 9th-generation Coffee Lake Refresh chips for laptops . These will be behind most gaming laptops and mobile workstations this year , while Whiskey Lake will remain behind most Ultrabooks . As for the next generation of Ultrabook class processors : Intel has announced Ice Lake , built on its 10nm process . Intel claims these processors will be out this summer for real this time , but we ’ ll probably start seeing laptops that are actually packing the chips in early 2020 – much like the launch of Whiskey Lake . Because Whiskey Lake is a mobile microarchitecture , it ’ s unlikely that the price of the actual chip will affect most consumers . For instance , the Intel Core i5-8250U is listed at $ 297 ( about £225 , AU $ 400 ) and the Intel Core i7 8550U at $ 409 ( about £310 , AU $ 551 ) . However , these aren ’ t really public facing prices , and is rather what laptop manufacturers pay to include these chips in their laptops . So , we ’ re getting 3 15W TDP U-series processors and 3 5W Amber Lake Y-series chips . With a Core i3 ( or m3 ) , i5 and i7 in either category , we can expect a pretty wide range of laptops starting at around $ 500 ( around £389 , AU $ 680 ) for the m3 and i3 laptops , whereas Core i7-backed notebooks will be more expensive , likely around $ 1,000 ( £760 , AU $ 1,350 ) . Either way , Whiskey Lake was just launched , so we ’ re sure we ’ ll see pricing for the laptops sporting these new processors in the very near future . Intel introduced three Whiskey Lake processors , a Core i3 , a Core i5 and a Core i7 . The Core i5 and i7 are both four-core , eight-thread chips , much like their Kaby Lake R brethren , whereas the Core i3 still rocks two cores and four threads . Where they really set themselves apart is in their clock speeds . The stock clocks on the Core i5 and i7 are virtually the same as the Core i5-8250U and Core i7-8550U at 1.6GHz and 1.8GHz respectively . But Intel , has boosted the boost clocks for the Core i5-8265U and Core i7-8565U drastically – up to 4.6GHz and 3.9GHz , respectively . We haven ’ t seen what this performance hike translates into RE : real world performance , but average users likely won ’ t notice a difference . However , this much of an increase in Turbo Boost speeds can back up Intel ’ s claim that Whiskey Lake can have up to a double-digit increase in performance over 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors . As far as the integrated GPU goes , though , it looks like Intel is sticking with the Intel UHD Graphics 620 chip found in the Kaby Lake-R chips , so don ’ t expect vastly improved GPU performance with this new microarchitecture – even if Intel says gamers will be able to play games using just the integrated graphics . What ’ s probably more noteworthy than clock speeds and GPU improvements , though is the fact that Intel has found a way to integrate 802.11 AC Wi-Fi into the PCH on Whiskey Lake processors . This functionality isn ’ t included in the Amber Lake Y-series chips , but Intel is offering discrete solutions for those fanless models – on top of eSIM support for laptop makers that want to build LTE modems into new laptops . We ’ re sure we ’ ll get more information about how these new processors perform once we get our hands on laptops running them . So , until then , be sure to check back often , as we ’ ll add any information that comes our way .
Before we get into all the Coffee Lake-X information , let ’ s just get one thing out of the way : it ’ s not confirmed to exist in any way , shape or form . Everything from here on out is speculation and rumor . Intel has had a rough couple of years . Ever since the onset of AMD Ryzen and Threadripper , Intel has been on the defensive – haphazardly throwing out CPU refreshes to keep ahead of AMD . Read more : Intel Core i9-9980XE Intel launched Skylake-X in response to AMD Ryzen Threadripper , and Intel ’ s HEDT lineup surpassed Team Red ’ s offerings , but only just . These days , now that AMD Threadripper 2nd Generation has been out for a while , led by the Threadripper 2990WX , a 32-core , 64-thread monster , the competition is still tough . But , Intel has responded with Basin Falls Refresh . So , where does that leave Coffee Lake-X ? Well , it ’ s hard to say . Coffee Lake-X actually did exist at one point , according to speculation from the Motley Fool , but it looks like it was scrapped . It doesn ’ t help that the next HEDT platform by Intel will indeed be Cascade Lake-X , so we ’ re not sure if we ’ ll ever see Coffee Lake-X . We essentially don ’ t know anything about Coffee Lake-X , let alone if it ’ s actually a thing . But , that won ’ t stop us from speculating , however . So , keep this page bookmarked , and we ’ ll update it if we hear anything . This is where things get a little hard to predict . If our earlier speculation is true , and Intel uses Coffee Lake-X to compete with Threadripper 2nd Generation or even Threadripper 3rd Gen , we might see an announcement soon – Threadripper 2nd Generation chips have been on the market for a while already . However , with Coffee Lake-X , it ’ s hard to even find vague speculation . Beyond Basin Falls Refresh , which launched late last year , all we know is that Intel ’ s next HEDT platform is rumored to be based on a 14nm process ( again ) . But , that will probably be Cascade Lake-X , not Coffee Lake-X . But , hey , maybe Intel will surprise us all at Computex 2019 . Intel supposedly confirmed a forthcoming X399 chipset , which would likely be the chipset that would support Coffee Lake-X , but right now it looks like that chipset will be for Cascade Lake-X , instead , according to a report from HotHardware . We ’ ll just have to wait until Intel to make some kind of announcement about the release date of its next HEDT platform . This is where things get interesting . Now , we have no idea what the Coffee Lake-X chips are going to look like , but they have to be basically better than Skylake-X , which is already absolutely bananas . If you need a refresher , the specs for the 7th-generation HEDT processors are as as follows : That last one , the Core i9-7980XE was the most powerful consumer processor of the last year , and still is at the time of this writing . However , that processor costs nearly $ 2,000 . Remember that rumor we mentioned earlier about the 32-core , 64-thread AMD Threadripper 2990X that ’ s supposedly launching for less than that ? That ’ s exactly what Intel is going to need top with Coffee Lake-X . Earlier , at Computex 2018 , Intel showed off a 28-core 56-thread CPU clocked at 5GHz . And , while that processor later turned out to be a Cascade Lake-X processor with a completely different LGA-3647 socket , that might actually be what Intel needs to release – and for much less than the rumored $ 10,000 that processor might end up costing . At the end of the day , we won ’ t know what Intel ’ s next line of HEDT processors is going to look like until it ’ s actually announced , but we do know that if Intel is going to stay competitive after Threadripper 2 comes out , it will need to come out with some beefy CPUs at a competitive price . And , you can rest assured that the moment Intel does that , we ’ ll update this page with any relevant information .
The wait for the next iteration of Intel ’ s HEDT lineup is over , and it ’ s been quite a ride . There was speculation that there would be a Coffee Lake-X , a Cascade Lake-X or a new Skylake-X HEDT platform . The latter proved to be the one that actually existed , this ‘ Basin Falls Refresh ’ is out now , helmed by the new 18-core Intel Core i9-9980XE . However , right now it ’ s rumored that Intel is planning on releasing a Cascade Lake-X later this year , based on its 14nm process . The Basin Falls Refresh lineup is remarkably similar to the Skylake-X line that it succeeds . It features the same core counts , but clock speeds get a minor boost , along with some enhanced features . These new HEDT processors largely follow in the footsteps of Coffee Lake Refresh , another CPU lineup announced at the same event . The biggest question that crops up with Basin Falls Refresh , though , especially in the midst of the heightened Intel vs AMD battle , is whether or not these new processors provide a better value than the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2nd Generation processors . To answer that question and more , we decided to gather up everything there is to know about Basin Falls Refresh . From the release date to pricing , and even a bit about the performance of Basin Falls Refresh . So , keep this page bookmarked and we ’ ll keep this article updated with all the latest Basin Falls Refresh news . The AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2nd Generation platform launched back in August 2018 , and ever since then , we ’ ve been waiting with bated breath for Intel to launch something to compete with it . Now Basin Falls Refresh processors are finally here , and ready to take Threadripper 2nd Generation on . We were initially hoping that Intel would price this new HEDT platform more competitively – especially considering how AMD is gaining popularity right now . Unfortunately , that didn ’ t seem to happen , with Intel instead pricing its Basin Falls Refresh pretty much exactly how it priced its 7th-generation Skylake-X processors . The prices for all the new X299 chips are as follows , from lowest to highest price . It ’ s pretty clear that these processors , like their predecessors , are extremely expensive , and are probably not a great value for most everyday desktop users . However , with some of these chips being nearly double the price of their Threadripper equivalents ( at least in terms of core counts ) , it remains to be seen whether or not they will be competitive among content creators and enthusiasts . Only time and benchmarks will tell . It goes without saying that these new Basin Falls Refresh processors bring some major improvements to Intel ’ s HEDT lineup . The biggest improvement here is the support of up to 68 PCI-E lanes ( still only 44 natively on the CPU , though , the chipset supports the remaining 24 ) . These new processors also feature much higher clock speeds , which should help in single threaded applications like gaming . The Specifications of the Basin Falls Refresh is as follows : It should be immediately noticeable that as the core count goes up , the base clock speeds go down , this is largely due to increasing power and heat constraints as the core denisty goes up throughout the processor family Still , the boost clocks are pretty stable throughout . Unfortunately , cache on these new Basin Falls Refresh processors is identical to the last generation , with 24.75MB on the Core i9-9980XE , which is the same amount found on the 7980XE . Now , we ’ ve only tested one of the Basin Falls Refresh chips , the Core i9-9980XE . However , we can use this flagship chip to get a feeling for how the Basin Falls Refresh lineup performs . The improved clock speeds on these Basin Fall Refresh processors lead to improved performance across the board , but in heavily threaded workloads , like Cinebench R15 , the Intel Core i9-9980XE still lags behind the Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX . Intel is claiming that this new lineup is going to offer up to 108 % faster performance over the 2990WX in Adobe Premiere . You may want to take this with a grain of salt , because while we haven ’ t measured Adobe Premiere performance ourselves , we do have Cinebench numbers for both the Intel Core i9-9980XE and the 2990WX . The Threadripper 2990WX scored 4,913 in Cinebench , whereas the Intel Core i9-9980XE scored 3,640 . Now , obviously Cinebench and Adobe Premiere aren ’ t the same program , but the tasks are comparable enough to make Intel ’ s claims seem fishy .
Intel Core i9-9900K : 4 stars | Dominating hyper-threading performance ; tight energy consumption | Expensive ; Little to no improvement for gaming When Intel launched the 8th-generation Coffee Lake processors , no one knew what was going on . But , we weren ’ t fooled again when it launched the 9th Generation Intel Coffee Lake Refresh lineup . This time around , Intel brought higher core counts and faster clock speeds across the board . Intel Coffee Lake Refresh bridges the gap between Coffee Lake and AMD Ryzen 2nd Generation – or it will until AMD launches its 3rd Generation Ryzen chips . And , now that we ’ ve seen Intel ’ s hand , led by the Intel Core i9-9900K , we know that these 9th-generation processors are capable of great things , even if the sales don ’ t reflect that . With Intel ’ s first mainstream , 8-core , 16-thread processors for consumers , Coffee Lake Refresh changes everything . Now , this is just the highlight reel , but there is so much more Coffee Lake Refresh information out there , so strap in for the long ride and we ’ ll tell you everything there is to know about the latest from Intel . At its 2018 Desktop Launch Event , Intel finally revealed when we can get our hands on its 9th Generation desktop lineup . The good news is that all the speculation was pretty much spot on – preorders are live now , and the chips will start shipping out on October 19 . Later , in April 2019 , Intel released the rest of the Coffee Lake Refresh lineup both on the desktop and mobile side . And , if you ’ re looking for a shiny new gaming laptop , the new 9th-generation H-series laptop chips will be powering the beefiest laptops this year . We ’ re also getting new desktop chips , though , namely the non-K variants . All of these chips have either already started shipping or should do so soon . The only exception would be the Intel Core i5-9400F , which is a non-overclockable chip without graphics . But , it ’ s significantly cheaper than the Intel Core i5-9600K . Now that Intel has announced its new desktop platform , we now know what the pricing is going to look like . For the most part , it falls in line with what Intel charged for Coffee Lake desktop chips , though the Intel Core i9 is much more expensive than the competition , namely the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X . But , at least Intel is giving users the choice to get processors without integrated graphics for the same price . The prices are as follows : We ’ re sure that Intel is going to pad this lineup with other mid-range and entry-level processors over the next year or so to pad out these massive price gaps . Until then , though , we can still expect fantastic multi-core performance at a reasonable price . Now that Intel has shown us what Coffee Lake Refresh is capable of , we have a clear picture of what these new processors look like . And , now that the Coffee Lake Refresh lineup is fleshed out , here is the core consumer lineup . This lineup is noteworthy , as it marks the first Intel Core i7 chip in a while without hyperthreading – instead it just features eight single-threaded cores . Still , that should be plenty , especially considering the impressive 4.9GHz boost clock . Luckily , there is still a 9th-generation consumer chip that retains hyperthreading in Intel ’ s Core i9-9900K . Then , there ’ s the F-series chips , which don ’ t come with the same Intel UHD 630 integrated GPU as the rest of the lineup . This lack of a GPU doesn ’ t come with a price drop , but it looks like they ’ re designed for OHM use . Intel might be pushing core counts even higher in the future . A recent forum post suggests that deca-core ‘ Comet Lake ’ processors , based on the same 14nm process as Coffee Lake Refresh are incoming . Either way it looks like Intel won ’ t be done with 14nm any time soon , unfortunately : its upcoming Cascade Lake processors will be based on the same process . These new processors also feature much improved thermal performance , thanks to a soldered thermal interface material ( STIM ) . This should help these processors overclock more efficiently without having to resort to exotic cooling solutions to stretch the performance out . This is big , because Intel has stuck with non-soldered thermal paste to transfer heat between the processor dies and the IHS – much to the chagrin of enthusiasts and overclockers . This new soldered material should be a much more efficient heat transfer medium , which Intel says will lead to easier overclocking . However , some of the new F-series Coffee Lake Refresh chips will be sticking with the non-soldered solution . Intel says this is because standard F-series chips won ’ t be overclocked , and thus won ’ t need the more robust cooling solution . Luckily , the processors model names with a ‘ KF ’ suffix will include the same STIM as earlier 9th-generation processors . One more thing – an Intel Core i9-9900T leak showed up on Yahoo Auctions . It seems to be a 35W version of the Intel Core i9-9900K with the same amount of cores and threads , but with a severely cut down clock speed . This part hasn ’ t been announced by Intel , so we would take it with a grain of salt – but this wouldn ’ t be the first time Intel launched low-power T-series chips for prebuilt computers . Of course , it wouldn ’ t be a new Intel processor lineup with a new motherboard and chipset platform . Interestingly enough , Intel ’ s forthcoming Z390 chipset is on the way , and can finally be preordered , after months and months of speculation . This new platform supports t onboard 802.11ac Wi-Fi , and USB 3.1 Gen 2 – both of which are features not found natively supported on the current Z370 chipset . This new chipset now supports up to 40 lanes of PCIe Express 3.0 , but is still limited to dual-channel , 2,666MHz memory . We have finally fully reviewed and tested Intel Core i9-9900K and it is , without a doubt , the fastest consumer processor on the market right now . Intel ’ s high end chip absolutely dominated everything else in both single core and multi core performance , scoring a ridiculous 33,173 multi-core score in GeekBench 4 – compared to the Ryzen 7 2700X ’ s 26,011 – it even destroys AMD ’ s HEDT Threadripper chips in many everyday situations . However , be careful of the inflated price you ’ re paying for this higher performance . WE haven ’ t tested either the Intel Core i7-9700K or the i5-9600K yet , but those reviews are on the way . Until then , though , we have some preliminary results from Intel , but take these with a grain of salt . Back at Intel ’ s reveal event for Coffee Lake Refresh , we were able to test the new processors in gaming specific workloads , where the Intel Core i7-9700K was able to hit 30,339 points in a World of Tanks benchmark – compared to the Intel Core i9-9900K ’ s 33,108 in the same test at the same event . Meanwhile , the Intel Core i7-9700K was able to hit 30,339 points in that same World of Tanks benchmark – which is impressive given that chip doesn ’ t feature multithreading . That ’ s all we got right now . There ’ s surely a ton of information to come – so , per our usual advice , we encourage you to keep this page bookmarked , as we ’ ll keep it updated with in-depth coverage of the latest Intel Coffee Lake Refresh news , information and reviews .
Fifth time ’ s the charm . At least that seems to be the case with Intel ’ s fifth round of processors based on the 14nm manufacturing process . After Intel released the laptop-focused Kaby Lake Refresh chips in August 2017 , it finally released the 8th-generation Coffee Lake lineup about a month later , along with a fresh lineup of the best motherboards . What was especially shocking is that even with tough competition , Intel was able to stay competitive , even if it has since lost its lead to AMD . Right now AMD is on top of the world with its Ryzen 2nd Generation processors , but Intel is still competing with Coffee Lake and its follow-up Coffee Lake Refresh . Either way , make sure you stay tuned to TechRadar , as we ’ ll update this article with any Coffee Lake news that comes our way . Originally , in February 2017 , Intel stated that Coffee Lake would surface in the latter half of the year . Intel reassured us of this claim at Computex 2017 held in Taipei , Taiwan . Later into 2017 , the Santa Clara chipmaker came out and teased an August 21 livestream reveal of its 8th-generation processors , which turned out to be a refresh of its 7th-generation processors for Ultrabooks and laptops , called Kaby Lake Refresh . Intel announced Coffee Lake back in September 2017 , and it the public release followed a month later . For a while , Intel Coffee Lake comfortably ruled the world , especially after Coffee Lake mobile chips arrived in April 2018 . These mobile chips are still powering some of the best gaming laptops , like the MSI GS65 Stealth . However , now that Intel has announced the 9th-generation Coffee Lake Refresh H-series mobile chips to replace them , we should see some substantial boosts in the mobile CPU world . There are also some U-series Coffee Lake chips , but those only made it into a few laptops , like the 2018 MacBook Pro , before being succeeded by Whiskey Lake . We also saw Intel ’ s low-power T-Series desktop chips around the same time – though you ’ ll more likely find these processor in pre-built PCs rather than on a computer store shelf . Back at Computex 2018 , Intel announced the Intel Core i7-8086K , celebrating its 50th anniversary , and is available today . This beast of a chip rocks the same 6-cores and 12-threads as the Intel Core i7 8700K , but they ’ re clocked significantly higher . Arguably the most elusive aspect of Coffee Lake leading up to its canonical announcement was pricing . Aside from looking at the processor market AMD Ryzen rewrote , we didn ’ t have much to base our speculation upon.. Luckily , Intel has revealed a total rundown of the latest 8th-generation Coffee Lake chips since their announcement . And with that reveal , we finally knew that the Santa Clara tech behemoth was going to unleash an entire assortment of processors with a wide range of different prices . Starting with the cheapest Core i3 chips the Coffee Lake series is priced as follows : Let ’ s break it down : although all of the 8th-generation Coffee Lake chips are still manufactured on the 14nm node , Intel has proven that there ’ s still plenty of life in the process yet . Again , starting from the ground up , the Intel Core i3 chips this time boast 4-cores each for the first time in the mainstream CPU space . What ’ s more , whereas the Intel Core i3-8100 takes advantage of four cores and four threads running at 3.6GHz , the unlocked Core i3-8350K totes the same number of cores and threads , but instead opts for a base frequency of 4GHz . As for the Core i5 range , the plain Intel Core i5-8400 is a now a hexa-core monster , bearing 6-cores and 6-threads . Moreover , its base clock is 2.8GHz , and it operates at 4GHz with Turbo Boost . Meanwhile the Core i5-8600K also squeezes six cores and six threads into the 14nm chip while brandishing base/boost speeds of 3.6GHz and 4.3GHz , respectively . Then you ’ ve got the Intel Core i7-8700 and i7-8700K . The former is yet another 6-core demon , albeit with double the number of threads as the i5-8600K . Its overclockable analogue , the Intel Core i7-8700K , poses a threat to the AMD Ryzen 7 2700X , sporting 6-cores , 12-threads and base/boost clock speeds of 3.7GHz/4.7GHz . Then , rounding out the Core i7 Coffee Lake CPUs , you have the Intel Core i7 8086K , which a 6-core 12-thread chip , clocked at 4.0GHz with a whopping 5.0GHz boost clock . This makes it the highest-clocked consumer chip Intel has released . Fitting way to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the original Intel 8086 processor . And , following the announcement for the anticipated H-Series Coffee Lake Processors , including the Core i9-8950HK , clocked at 2.9GHz with a 4.8GHZ boost clock , we ’ re going to see some blazing fast laptops powered by these 6-core , 12-thread behemoths . Intel has also announced a new line of low-powered T-series desktop CPUs that should effectively fill out the budget segment of the CPU market . That ’ s all we know for now . We ’ ve seen a wide array of 8th-generation Coffee Lake processors , including a few Coffee Lake processors for laptops to mark the end of the series . From here out , we expect Intel will move on with a new series of 9th Generation Coffee Lake Refresh CPUs , and , who knows ? Maybe we ’ ll actually see Coffee Lake-X or Cascade Lake-X chips eventually . There still a ton of news to come . Per our usual advice , we encourage you return to this page periodically for in-depth coverage of the latest Intel Coffee Lake reveals .

In the wake of Samsung 's struggles with the Galaxy Fold smartphone , an Intel executive says it may be two years before the technology shows up in laptops , according to a report by Nikkei Asian Review . While in Taipei for the start of Intel 's Project Athena Open Lab program , Intel 's general manager of mobile innovation and vice president of its Client Computing Group , Joshua D. Newman , said of foldable displays that Intel is `` trying to understand the capability and the limitation of the [ foldable ] technology . '' Newman also told Nikkei Asian Review that the technology was at least two years away from appearing in foldable laptops for consumers . One big challenge ahead for foldable displays in laptops has been made apparent by Samsung 's own foldable smartphone . Samsung has invested heavily in flexible display technology , and that all culminated in the Galaxy Fold this year . And , within days of the new phone reaching reviewers , multiple displays were failing – some because reviewers removed a protective layer and others for less apparent reasons . Not only has the incident done some damage to the reputation of foldable displays , but it has highlighted that more work is needed in perfecting the technology . In June , the Huawei Mate X will have an opportunity to show whether foldable displays can work . Of course , laptop makers then still need to develop the technology further for their own products . That will take some time . Newman said that Intel would accelerate development if the foldable displays offered positive experiences for users . And , that leads to the next question : what 's the use for laptops ? Laptops may not have foldable displays , but the laptops as a whole are already foldable . The value proposition is clear in phones , as the display size can increase dramatically . But , laptops already have sizable displays , and a screen that folds over on itself to then fold over on the keyboard does n't sound like a crowd-pleaser . So , beyond getting the technology to work well , laptop manufacturers need to find a design that offers some practical advantages over a traditional laptop . Via LaptopMag
Intel has clarified that its long-delayed next-gen processors built on a 10nm process will start to ship in June , and indeed that the chip giant has learned from its mistakes , and will be able to push forward with greater speed dropping to 7nm CPUs promising even better performance come 2021 . This , and a ton of other roadmap and product info , was divulged by Intel at its 2019 investor meeting . Intel claimed its 7nm products will debut in 2021 starting with Intel Xe , the next-gen graphics solution we ’ ve been hearing so much about lately , although in this case , the first offering will be a General-Purpose GPU for heavyweight usage in the data center . That will be followed by a 7nm Xeon ( server processor ) . A consumer-targeted Intel Xe graphics card is expected in 2020 , the year before the aforementioned GP-GPU , although that won ’ t be 7nm – but rather 10nm . Speaking of 10nm , as we said at the outset , the first Ice Lake offerings will start shipping in June , and Intel ’ s 10nm ramp predicts that client systems will be on sale for the holiday season at the end of 2019 . This is in line with what we ’ ve previously heard , namely that consumer laptops using Ice Lake processors will be available at the very end of the year . Server offerings using the CPUs will follow in the first half of 2020 . Furthermore , 10nm Tiger Lake processors will follow Ice Lake in 2020 , arriving in laptops and packing Intel ’ s Xe graphics ( rather than Ice Lake ’ s Gen11 integrated graphics ) , which will be capable of running multiple 4K displays ( or driving an 8K monitor ) . As Tom ’ s Hardware reports , chief executive Bob Swan noted that this forecasted swift move from 10nm to 7nm reflects an acceleration of the production of the process node . In other words , Intel has learned a lot of lessons from the difficulties in transitioning from current 14nm chips to these incoming 10nm efforts , with the insights and gains therein meaning swifter progress when dropping down to 7nm ( and subsequently refining ) . Or at least that ’ s the theory . Intel further noted that Ice Lake ( 10nm ) will effectively double integrated graphics performance levels compared to Coffee Lake CPUs – not surprising as it sports the aforementioned Gen11 graphics we ’ ve been hearing good things about – as well as doubling video encoding performance , and tripling wireless speeds . As for 7nm performance , Intel is quoting impressive further steps on from there with gains in power and efficiency , specifically a 15 % improvement in transistor performance , and a bigger 20 % boost in terms of performance-per-watt . Finally , it ’ s worth noting that Intel said that issues with stock shortages of current 14nm processors would continue to improve going forward , and that they would be fully resolved by the fourth quarter . The last we heard , this was expected to happen in the third quarter , but at any rate , Intel anticipates that inventory shortages will be a thing of the past before 2019 is out . That ’ s good news certainly , as consumers and PC makers alike have been struggling when it comes to getting hold of Intel ’ s mid-range and particularly lower-end processors ( as the chip giant has been concentrating on making high-end products with more profit margin using its limited production capacity ) .
Intel is envisioning a bold new future for laptops with its Project Athena initiative , which the company first announced at CES 2019 . Project Athena will see Intel offer guidance to equipment and PC component manufacturers to create future laptops that are smarter , faster ( thanks to 5G ) and more power efficient – which will hopefully mean much longer battery lives . This week , the wraps came off the plan , as Intel gathered with hundreds of members of the PC manufacturing industry in Taiwan . This is where one of the Intel 's Project Athena Open Labs is located – specifically in Taipei – with another in Folsom , California . Intel 's Project Athena Open Labs will work as a resource for equipment and component manufacturers to test their products . Intel has brought engineers with system-on-chip ( SoC ) and power optimization expertise to these Open Labs , and they 'll conduct testing and offer guidance to manufacturers on how to improve their products . The goal is ensure a wide range of Project Athena-compliant components that original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) can depend on to work in more power-efficient laptops . Component manufacturers will submit their products to the Project Athena Open Labs to see if they can meet the specifications . These components can include everything from displays , audio devices , haptic feedback motors , SSDs , wireless modules and more . By covering the whole range of components , the program should allow OEMS to easily choose components for devices that follow Project Athena specifications and more or less guarantee better power efficiency . Project Athena is aimed toward 2020 and beyond , with future devices featuring 5G connectivity and AI in mind . But , we wo n't have to wait until 2020 to get the first laptops offering Project Athena specifications . The first batch of Project Athena devices is slated for the second half of this year . And , while Project Athena is focused on the components , not the complete computers , the news has n't said which chips will be at the heart of the experience . Intel 's Ice Lake processors could be coming at the end of the year , and with their 10nm architecture , they may be an ideal candidate for more power efficient laptops .

Apple doesn ’ t like losing , so when it announced its latest financial results ( for the fiscal second quarter , running up to the end of March ) , the fact that it had to admit that revenue for its Mac business declined by 5 % , must have stung . However , Apple was keen to pin the decline on the fact that it “ faced some processor constraints in the March quarter , ” and that “ Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints ” . Essentially , Apple was blaming Intel ’ s recent processor shortage for the slump in Mac sales . Now , we love a bit of juicy feuding between the big beasts of the technology world – mainly because not only is it entertaining , it ’ s also pretty rare for one company to blame one of its partners for its problems . But , while Intel has been providing processors that power Apple ’ s MacBooks and Mac computers for a while now , the relationship between the two companies has turned a little frosty . This hasn ’ t been helped by the rumors that suggest Apple is looking to ditch Intel and create its own ARM-based CPU . These rumors suggest that Apple wants to make its own processor so that it can make apps that are compatible with both Macs and iPhone and iPads , which run on similar processors . Now this logic is pretty sound – as apps that can run on a variety of different devices are all the rage at the moment . It ’ s not that easy though ; just look at Microsoft and its dying UWP ( Universal Windows Platform ) apps . Actually , don ’ t do that , as it would mean opening up the Microsoft Store in Windows 10 , and no one wants that . Having complete control over the hardware – and not having to pay a third party to develop its processors – would also lead to bigger profit margins , and we all know how Apple loves to make money . However , with Apple clearly feeling that Intel is holding back its business , the company may be looking more closely at what it can do it rid itself of its Intel dependency . But , it ’ s not that easy to create your own processor . I should know – as I ’ ve tried . Admittedly , my processor , the Matt64 , was doomed to fail due to it being made out of Lego and sweet wrappers , but for Apple to make its own processor , it will take time and money . Perhaps there ’ s an easier way . For a company with pockets as deep as Apple 's , maybe there ’ s a way to have complete control over its hardware without depending on Intel , while also giving its once partner a poke in the eye – by buying AMD . I can ’ t be serious , right ? Well… Think about it . Apple buying AMD would give it a company that makes its own processors , so in theory it wouldn ’ t have to wait around for tedious ( and expensive ) research and development – it could have almost ready-made CPUs available to plonk into the next generation of Mac computers . Apple already uses AMD ’ s graphics cards for its devices – so there ’ s a potential saving there as well . Plus , while AMD is doing better than it was during its wilderness years , the company didn ’ t have stellar financial results either , mainly due to the cryptocurrency gold rush fizzling out . That led to a drop in share price for AMD , which means Apple could easily snap it up . Also , imagine the fallout such a move would make ! Both Intel and Nvidia , AMD ’ s competitors , would be quaking in their boots . The idea that AMD hardware wouldn ’ t be available for Windows PCs could also cause a great disturbance in the Force , as if millions of fanboys suddenly cried out in terror . It would be nuts . But it does make sense . Sort of . And it will never happen . What ’ s more likely is that Apple and Intel continue to fall out , and Apple does indeed build its own ARM-based processor . It ’ s a shame , as Apple buying AMD would be crazy , ambitious , surprising , and – above all – rather exciting .

Apple is blaming Intel for its recent dip in Mac revenue , with Tim Cook and co firing some considerable flak at the chip giant . As Forbes spotted , in notes pertaining to Apple ’ s latest financial results ( for the fiscal second quarter , running up to the end of March ) , Luca Maestri , Chief Financial Officer , observed : “ Next I ’ d like to talk about the Mac . Revenue was 5.5 billion compared to 5.8 billion a year ago , with the decline driven primarily by processor constraints on certain popular models . ” CEO Tim Cook added : “ For our Mac business overall , we faced some processor constraints in the March quarter , leading to a 5 percent revenue decline compared to last year . But we believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints , and don ’ t believe this challenge will have a significant impact on our Q3 results . ” The implication is that these chip supply problems have something to do with the fact that we haven ’ t yet heard anything about MacBook updates for this year , and potential delays for hardware may be tied into this . That certainly makes some kind of sense , particularly as over at Daring Fireball , John Gruber also picked up on this one , noting that he ’ d previously asked an inside source at Apple why it took so long for the firm to release its new MacBook Air last year , and the one-word answer was simply ‘ Intel ’ . It ’ s clearly true that Intel ’ s manufacturing woes and stock shortages of its current-gen processors have had a wide impact across the whole computing industry , even for the big players in terms of PC vendors ( and the smaller operations have struggled even more , in some cases having to resort to using older Intel CPUs in their machines – or indeed switching to AMD ) . Intel has been concentrating on making higher-end processors with the production capacity it has . Given that these command the biggest profit margins , that makes financial sense , but it leaves mid-range and budget CPUs thinner on the ground . And sadly , the latest from Intel is that these challenges aren ’ t going to go away soon , and will likely persist until Q3 . However , Cook says above that he doesn ’ t believe these processor supply constraints will impact the current quarter for Apple , and so as we head into Q3 of 2019 , the picture should get even better – if Intel is correct and it does indeed resolve these production problems with its CPUs . All of which could point to whatever MacBook refreshes Apple is planning for 2019 perhaps arriving later in the year , when Intel silicon is available in more abundance , rather than sooner . We should hopefully at least get some decent spec bumps of existing machines , even if we don ’ t see the rumored 16-inch all-new MacBook Pro , which has allegedly been delayed until 2020 ( or perhaps even the year after ) . Guessing at what ’ s happening behind the scenes aside , what all this does clearly underline is Apple ’ s dependence on Intel in the supply chain when it comes to the Mac . And despite Intel ’ s recent assurances that it will be making every effort to ensure this sort of processor stock shortage doesn ’ t happen again , this is clearly another good reason why Apple might make the move to ARM with its Macs . This is already rumored to be happening , with chatter from developers and insiders at Intel insisting that Apple will be shifting to use custom ARM-based chips in 2020 . Making its own ARM processors will be a big change – and not an easy endeavor , of course – but it will give Apple a number of advantages going forward , not least taking back control of the supply chain , but also upping the profit made on Macs by removing Intel from the equation . Further benefits will also doubtless be reaped in terms of having all of its devices – Macs , iPhones and iPads alike – powered by similar ARM CPUs , allowing for apps to be developed more easily to run across all these pieces of hardware . Seemingly , then , it ’ s just a matter of time before Apple and Intel ’ s divorce comes through in this respect , and that could certainly explain why Apple is happy enough to take some very public pot-shots at Intel over its current supply difficulties .

Intel has announced that hardware ray tracing will be supported with its upcoming graphics cards , at least in the data center models – but that ’ s perhaps a solid clue that the firm ’ s consumer GPUs will also support the technology . The news that Intel ’ s Xe GPUs will carry said support came in a lengthy blog post regarding the FMX graphics conference , in which the company noted : “ The Intel Xe architecture roadmap for data center optimized rendering includes ray tracing hardware acceleration support for the Intel Rendering Framework family of API ’ s and libraries . ” So , there ’ s been a fair bit of chatter already about whether Intel ’ s consumer graphics cards might support ray tracing , given that Nvidia has very much championed the tech with its latest Turing RTX products – which have dedicated cores to better cope with the demands of ray tracing – and that firm will be Intel ’ s big rival in the GPU space . And if its data center GPUs are coming with ray tracing support built-in at the hardware level , it ’ s not a huge leap to make in imagining that Intel is also planning this for its mainstream graphics card offerings ( or at least the high-end ones , perhaps ) . All this is speculation at this point , obviously , and there ’ s no guarantee that this will happen . As ever , we ’ ll have to wait and see , but as Intel ’ s new GPUs are expected to come out in 2020 , it might not be too long before we hear more on exactly how far the chip giant plans to go with ray tracing support . There ’ s another caveat here , too : the above announcement states that ray tracing is on the architecture roadmap , so that doesn ’ t necessarily mean it will be involved in the initial incarnation of Intel ’ s Xe products . But we can obviously hope that will likely be the case . Another interesting point here is that at the FMX conference , which covers all sorts of topics on graphics , animations and effects , Intel was pushing Embree , its high-performance ray tracing kernels , along with other technologies designed for photorealistic output and cutting-edge visual effects employed in big-name animated movies like ‘ How to Train Your Dragon ’ . And more specifically , Xeon processors running Embree , with the blog post touting the benefits of Intel Xeon Scalable processors along with these technologies , and incoming Intel Xe GPUs , which when all tied together should allow new heights of impressiveness to be reached in the realm of animated movies . Animations , whether shorts or full-length films , have already reached some pretty incredible levels of realism , so it ’ s quite exciting to think that Intel ’ s new graphics cards should help to drive further innovation in conjunction with its processors – and hopefully make this sort of technology more widely available to film makers – concerns about consumer graphics cards aside .

Rumors have been swirling for a while now that Apple is planning to move away from Intel processors for its Mac devices and instead design its own CPUs , and now we 've heard that the company has hired Mike Filippo , ARM 's lead CPU and system architect . Filippo ’ s LinkedIn profile states that he joined Apple last month . During his time at ARM , he led the development of the Cortex-A76 , Cortex-A72 , Cortex-A57 chips . Filippo has also worked as a lead CPU and system architect at Intel and a chip designer at AMD , so he ’ s got a huge amount of knowledge and experience when it comes to processors . His hiring could be a real win for Apple ’ s CPU ambitions . The fact that Apple has employed such a senior ARM architect could be seen as further proof that it 's planning to launch ARM-powered Macs as early as 2020 . Apple ’ s move makes a lot of sense – if that ’ s indeed what it 's doing . The company has been vocal about how its reliance on Intel hardware hasn ’ t been ideal . Earlier this year , Apple blamed Intel ’ s processor shortage for slump in Mac sales . The fact that Intel ’ s processors have also been victim to high profile security vulnerabilities may also have cemented Apple ’ s decision to build its own processor . Apple already makes its own processors for its iPhone and iPad devices , as well as the T2 security chip in recent Macs , so this move wouldn ’ t be completely out of the blue . It also follows news that Microsoft is apparently looking to stop exclusively using Intel chips for its Surface devices , with the company testing prototypes with AMD and ARM processors . So it ’ s not been great news for Intel recently . Its former partners looking to use its competitors ( or make their own CPUs ) is something we warned would happen .

A new report suggests that Microsoft could be considering moving from Intel to AMD to power its next lineup of Surface device after apparently becoming increasingly disappointed by Intel ’ s products . This move would be a major blow for Intel – and a big win for its competitor AMD . For the past five years , all of Microsoft ’ s Surface products have run on Intel processors , but as Brad Sams – noted Microsoft expert at Petri.com – alleges , insiders at Microsoft have described the company ’ s relationship with Intel as “ being on shaky ground , ” leading to the company looking to “ diversify away from a purely-Intel lineup ” for its next-generation Surface products . According to Sams , Microsoft is experimenting with using AMD and ARM chips , with prototype devices having already been made . A prototype Surface Laptop is apparently using a 12nm AMD Picasso SoC ( system on chip ) . Meanwhile , a new Surface Pro prototype is said to be using a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip . It seems that Microsoft is working with Qualcomm to build its own ARM chip , code-named Excalibur , that is said to work better on Windows 10 . This sounds similar to the situation with Apple , which is said to be dropping Intel in favor of its own ARM-based processors . The rumors – and remember , these are just rumors at the moment – do make sense . Microsoft has established relationships with both AMD and Qualcomm – the former making the chips for the upcoming Xbox Scarlett console , the latter working with Microsoft on Windows on Snapdragon devices – so it ’ s not unthinkable that the company would be looking to work with them on new Surface devices . The fact that Microsoft is apparently looking at other CPU makers after falling out with Intel is something we suggested might happen after a string of bad news about Intel . According to Sams , the reason why Microsoft and Intel ’ s relationship has soured is because of disappointing product releases by Intel . As Sams states , “ With Skylake , Microsoft got burned by the immaturity between Windows and the chips which resulted in faulty hardware and a serious black eye to the brand ’ s high-quality reputation. ” Skylake is the name for Intel ’ s sixth-generation Core processors , and while they generally performed well , they were also victim to high-profile security flaws , including Meltdown and Spectre . However , Microsoft won ’ t be completely dropping Intel from its devices , according to Sams . Intel ’ s brand power is still strong enough to shift products , and it looks like there will be an Intel-powered Surface Pro 7 , as well as new versions of the Surface Book and as well .

Both Microsoft and Intel have confirmed that they will continue to support Huawei laptops despite the Chinese company ’ s blacklisting by the US Government . This will be welcome news for anyone who owns a Huawei laptop , as there was the worry that since the US government ’ s decision , those laptops would stop getting major updates for Windows 10 . Microsoft had been tight-lipped about its support of Huawei laptops , refusing to confirm or deny that it would block Windows 10 updates – much like how Google blocked Android updates on Huawei ’ s smartphones . Although Microsoft stopped selling Huawei laptops from its store ( only to start selling them again not long after ) , its silence on whether or not it will provide Windows 10 updates for the hardware going forward was very concerning . Although Huawei makes some of the best laptops in the world right now , if they couldn ’ t download important Windows 10 updates , they ’ d be practically useless . It ’ s good that Microsoft has finally clarified things , and has provided a statement to PCWorld that says : “ We remain committed to providing exceptional customer experiences . Our initial evaluation of the US Department of Commerce ’ s decision on Huawei has indicated we may continue to offer Microsoft software updates to customers with Huawei devices . ” This is the strongest indication yet that Microsoft will continue to provide updates for Huawei laptops . Intel has also confirmed to PCWorld that it will continue to provide security updates and drivers for Huawei laptops . The fact that these two companies are continuing to patch Huawei laptops means that owners of those devices don ’ t need to worry that they will be vulnerable to future security risks . It also means that if you see a bargain on a Huawei laptop , you can buy it knowing that you ’ ll continue to get updates and support for the foreseeable future . With the recent uncertainty surrounding future support for Huawei laptops , you may notice some very impressive price cuts ahead of Amazon Prime Day 2020 .

AMD Ryzen 3rd Generation is right around the corner , launching on July 7 , and that means leaked benchmarks are coming in rapidly . This time , it 's the Ryzen 7 3800X – and if this particular leak is to be believed it 'll wipe the floor with the Intel Core i9-9900K , at least in multi-threaded workloads . This comes via a leaked Geekbench result , spotted by Wccftech . The leak shows the Ryzen 7 3800X returning a multi-core result of 34,059 , which is significantly higher than our Intel Core i9-9900K result of 33,173 . This is especially notable when you consider that the Ryzen 7 3800X is launching for $ 399 ( about £310 , AU $ 580 ) – perhaps that 's why Intel 's rumored to be slashing its prices . However , it does n't look quite as good when you compare single-core performance . Here , the Ryzen 7 3800X got a score of 5,406 , compared to the 9900K 's 6,633 – so Intel may end up staying on top of the hill when it comes to single-threaded performance . Still , according to the Geekbench entry , the AMD processor was running on an X470 motherboard , with 16GB of RAM clocked at just 2,130MHz ; so it 's possible that the 3800X was just held back by the weak hardware it was paired with . Either way , it 's still an impressive showing from the Ryzen 7 3800X , and we ca n't wait to see what it 's capable of on proper X570 hardware . Luckily , that July 7 release date is right around the corner , so we wo n't be waiting long to see the next skirmish in the AMD vs Intel battle .
As AMD Ryzen 3rd Generation processors get closer to their final release , Intel is rumored to slash desktop processor prices by up to 15 % – or up to $ 75 ( about £60 , AU $ 110 ) at the high end . This all comes from anonymous sources within the motherboard market , according to a report from DigiTimes . This price cut will apparently apply to desktop chips across the 8th-generation Coffee Lake and 9th-generation Coffee Lake Refresh lineups . If these rumors are true , the AMD vs Intel competition could certainly heat up , as the Intel Core i9-9900K , if cut by 15 % , would only cost about $ 415 ( about £370 , AU $ 600 ) . This would make it a much more competitive price against the $ 399 ( about £315 , AU $ 580 ) Ryzen 7 3800X that will challenge its position in July . Now , we would of course take these rumors with a grain of salt , but it would be the first time Intel has dropped prices in response to an AMD Ryzen launch . Could this mean Team Blue is running scared in response to the increased competition ? AMD Ryzen 3rd Generation processors are n't quite out yet , but all of the leaks and rumors we 've seen so far , along with AMD 's own boasting , hints that these processors will give Intel a run for its money . If something like the AMD Ryzen 7 3800X does come out at $ 399 ( about £315 , AU $ 580 ) with equivalent performance to the $ 499 ( £499 , AU $ 805 ) Core i9-9900K , it does n't look like a good value proposition for Intel . That alone makes this rumored price drop more believable . Still , pre-release performance information is n't the most reliable in the world , but luckily the mainstream AMD Zen 2 processors will be out on July 7 , and then we 'll know how much trouble Intel is in , if any .

Intel Ice Lake performance has appeared in a leaked PassMark result , showing faster performance than the AMD Ryzen 5 3500U , despite Team Red 's chip having a higher base clock speed . This follows another leaked benchmark , which appeared back in May in Geekbench . This one via PassMark , spotted by famed hardware leaker TUM_APISAK and Notebook Check , shows the Intel Core i7-1065G7 scoring 10,316 points in PassMark 's CPUMark test , compared to the Ryzen 5 3500U 's 8,042 points . This PassMark result has been deleted , but that does n't mean you ca n't find a cached version . Google Cachehttps : //t.co/I8lK9PGtan pic.twitter.com/pd5HMwboxUJune 17 , 2019 Digging into these results shows significantly better IPC ( instructions per clock ) performance on Intel 's Ice Lake chip . This is a leak , so you should of course take it with a grain of salt , but the Intel Core i7-1065G7 has a base clock of just 1.3GHz compared to the 3500U 's 2.1GHz , but manages to beat AMD 's chip in the single-thread rating . It should be noted , though , that the AMD Ryzen 5 3500U is based on the Zen+ architecture , rather than the 7nm Zen 2 . Intel claims that the 10nm Sunny Covearchitecture will boast an 18 % IPC improvement over Skylake , but AMD also claims 15 % IPC improvement in Zen 2 over Zen+ . Either way , we wo n't know how Intel Ice Lake mobile processors actually perform until we see them out in the real world . Luckily , they should be on their way out to retailers now , so we should n't have to wait too much longer to get our hands on Ice Lake . Via Wccftech

While coverage surrounding the US government 's Huawei ban has focused primarily on how the Chinese tech giant will be affected , it 's worth remembering that the company 's US suppliers also stand to lose a great deal of money in the fallout of President Trump 's executive order . Now , it appears that US chipmakers , including Intel , Qualcomm and Xilinx Inc , have been quietly lobbying the US government in an effort to ease the Huawei ban , as reported by Reuters . Citing sources close to the situation , executives from Intel and Xilinx Inc reportedly met with the US Commerce Department in late May to discuss a response to the Trump Administration 's decision to place Huawei on the 'entity list ' , effectively barring US companies from trading with the Chinese brand . According to four other sources , Qualcomm has also reportedly met with the Commerce Department to discuss the issue . The Semiconductor Industry Association trade group has confirmed that it arranged meetings with US government on behalf of the chipmakers . While the American chip suppliers do n't deny the potential threat to national security that Huawei 's 5G networking technology could present , the US companies also argue that the Chinese firm 's servers and smartphones use commonly available components and are far less likely to pose a risk , sources also suggest . Of course , the discussions are just that – a representative for the Commerce Department told Reuters that the governmental body “ routinely responds to inquiries from companies regarding the scope of regulatory requirements , ” but that the discussions do not “ influence law enforcement actions . ” One thing that should n't be confused is the real reason for the US chipmakers ' interest in the matter , which is to prevent the potential loss of billions in revenue . `` This isn ’ t about helping Huawei . It ’ s about preventing harm to American companies , '' said one of Reuters ' sources . The report also states that of the `` $ 70 billion that Huawei spent buying components in 2018 , some $ 11 billion went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm , Intel and Micron Technology Inc . '' Singaporean-owned ( but US-based ) chipmaker Broadcom has already reported a decline in Q2 revenues and has lowered its expectations for the rest of the year , citing the US Huawei ban as the chief cause .

AMD ’ s Ryzen 9 3950X , a 16-core processor aimed at mainstream users ( and gamers , with AMD pitching it as a ‘ gaming CPU ’ ) , might not be out until September , but a performance benchmark has already leaked , and it looks quite astonishing . Discovered by prolific CPU leaker TUM_APISAK , the Geekbench 4 result shows the 16-core chip hitting a score of 5,868 for single-core and 61,072 for multi-core . AMD 100-000000033-011 Processor , 16 Cores , 32 Threadshttps : //t.co/ZMfGEBGQITJune 12 , 2019 Assuming the benchmark is the real deal , and actually from a genuine Ryzen 9 3950X , this represents a pretty incredible performance level . The numbers may not mean much to you in isolation , but they compare very favorably to not just AMD ’ s existing range , but also rival Intel products . As highlighted by one of the comments on the above tweet , a typical result for the Intel Core i9-9980XE high-end desktop processor ( at stock clock speeds ) is around 5,400 in single-core , and 47,000 in multi-core . And that ’ s a monster ‘ extreme edition ’ 18-core CPU with a max turbo of 4.4GHz . And the new chip very much blows away AMD ’ s own existing 16-core Threadripper 2950X , which as Wccftech ( who first spotted the tweet ) points out , averages around 4,800 and 38,000 in single and multi-core benchmarks respectively . But what we really have to remember here is that Intel ’ s Core i9-9980XE is priced at about $ 2,000 ( around £1,580 , AU $ 2,900 ) , the Threadripper retails for $ 830 ( around £660 , AU $ 1,200 ) or so online currently , and the Ryzen 9 3950X comes with a recommended price of $ 749 ( around £590 , AU $ 1,080 ) . All this would appear to make the 3950X an extremely compelling value proposition in terms of price/performance . Still , before we get too carried away , let ’ s remember all the caveats here : this is an unconfirmed leak we can ’ t be certain about , and even if it is genuine , we are only looking at a single benchmark suite , which doesn ’ t represent the full picture . Also , if we look at Intel ’ s mainstream Core i9-9900K Geekbench results , this hits about 6,200 points in single-core and 31,000 points for multi-core . So that single-core result does beat the 3950X by a few hundred points thanks to its ability to hit 5GHz ( with a stock chip ) on one core . However , equally we must note that the benchmarked AMD chip could be an early ( engineering ) sample of the 3950X , as the clock speeds are running slightly slower than we ’ ve been promised by AMD , with the base clock at 3.3GHz rather than 3.5GHz , and boost to 4.3GHz ( as opposed to a 4.7GHz maximum , albeit that won ’ t be across all cores ) . And that means the finished AMD product which launches in September could potentially be even faster , and might just about equal the 9900K even in single-core performance . Note that the 9900K is an 8-core chip , and can be had at the time of writing for around $ 500 ( around £395 , AU $ 725 ) . TUM_APISAK also floats the possibility that AMD might produce a non-X version of the processor – ie Ryzen 9 3950 – although that sounds like a pretty wild shot in the dark to us . All in all , this is a very interesting leak , and given that the Ryzen 9 3950X is already breaking overclocking world records , it seems the world of high-end mainstream PC processors is about to seriously kick up a gear .

Apple is reportedly in talks to buy Intel ’ s German modem business as it seeks to take more control over the iPhone ’ s supply chain . The Information says talks between the two companies started last year , with Intel eager to sell off its modem division . Intel has supplied Apple with modem chips since 2016 , supplanting Qualcomm , but has struggled to keep pace with its rival . Earlier this year , Intel abandoned plans to build 5G modems after missing a number of deadlines for development of a chip that would have powered the first next generation iPhone in 2020 . Apple has moved to design more of its components itself in recent years in order to gain more control over cost , development and timelines . This allows the firm to differentiate against Android manufacturers who source from a pool of suppliers . The Cupertino-based company has made its own processors for the iPhone and iPad since 2010 , while in 2017 , it announced it planned to stop including UK chip manufacturer Imagination Technologies ’ graphics technology in favour of an alternative developed in-house . However , developing a modem chip is a complicated and expensive exercise . Apple has already set up shop in San Diego , hoping to attract engineers over from Qualcomm , but it might not be until 2025 that the first iPhones with Apple-designed modem chips will appear . Acquiring part of Intel ’ s business would be a huge boost . Last year it bought UK-based power management chip firm Dialog Semiconductor in a deal that involved patents , staff and products and it is speculated that any deal with Intel would be similar . The German part of Intel ’ s modem business is the most integral and originates from the 2011 acquisition of Infineon , which saw more than 1,000 engineers join Intel . A number of senior executives that made the transition are now at Apple , adding strength to the reports . TechRadar Pro has contacted Apple and Intel for comment . Via The Information

There are whispers on the grapevine that Google is thinking of switching its servers over from Intel to AMD , which would obviously be a huge win for the latter . Before we get too carried away , though , bear firmly in mind that this is merely speculation from an analyst firm . As Seeking Alpha highlighted , Lynx Equity Research is the company in question , with its analysts hearing ‘ rumblings ’ that Google is no longer happy with Intel ’ s server hardware . Moreover , the analyst firm has floated the notion that its research into the supply chain indicates that AMD server boards are being made for Google , to back up the broad assertion . If this prediction comes true , the gravity of this can ’ t be underestimated for AMD , given the sheer weight of number of servers that Google has ( Google is obviously one of the biggest server heavyweights out there , probably vying for the top spot with Microsoft , although exact figures aren ’ t clear ) . Not to mention the general signal this will give off to the server buying world . Remember that server CPUs are where the real money is to be made , not consumer chips ( although in the latter , AMD is already squeezing out Intel by all accounts ) . AMD has made big strides with its ‘ Rome ’ second-gen Epyc server processors , which are set to be launched in August , with other analysts previously picking out these CPUs and the data center market as a particular strong point for AMD with its new 7nm products . Epyc offers 64-cores and 128-threads per socket , not to mention that crucially , for the business market , AMD ’ s chips have been seen to have less security issues than Intel ’ s in recent times . Of course , even if Google is switching across to AMD as suggested , that shift will happen slowly ( likely very slowly ) over time . And Intel will doubtless want to fight back , and fight back hard – it ’ s already rumored to be doing so in the consumer market with a purported 10-core Comet Lake CPU to take on AMD ’ s new Ryzen 9 3900X .

Update : Intel has released a statement clarifying Bob Swan 's comments , and arguing that its 10nm chips will be comparable with AMD 's current 7nm process . Meanwhile , Intel promises that its 7nm that will arrive in 2021 will provide 2x scaling . “ There ’ s been some confusion around node names , because over the years we ’ ve held ourselves to a stricter standard than others . But we want to set the record straight . Our 10nm node is comparable to the foundries ’ 7nm nodes today . Our 7nm process , which is on track for a 2021 first-product introduction , will deliver 2X scaling on top of that . So , purely from a process standpoint , we are neck-and-neck with the foundries . When you add to that our innovations in packaging , interconnect , architecture and software , it ’ s clear we have what it takes to deliver industry-leading products today and in the future . ” As Intel has not yet released its 10nm consumer processors , we can not verify its claims just yet – but we 're looking forward to putting them through their paces soon . Original story follows ... Intel has explained how it struggled to bring 10-nanometer processors to market , while also admitting that we won ’ t see its 7nm chips until 2021 . Meanwhile , its competitor AMD has recently released 7nm chips ( such as the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X ) . The revelations come from Intel CEO Bob Swan , who said at Fortune 's Brainstorm Tech conference in Aspen , Colorado , that Intel ’ s goal to have a 2.7x transistor density improvement in its 10nm chips compared to current 14nm chips was too ambitious . `` At a time when it gets harder and harder , we set a more aggressive goal . From that it just took us longer , '' Swan said . Because of this , Intel has been slow to move on from 14nm . This has led many people to suggest that – for Intel at least – Moore ’ s Law is dead . Moore ’ s Law , which is named after Intel co-founder and former CEO Gordon Moore , states that transistor density in computer chips doubles every two years . It ’ s been a driving principle behind Intel ’ s processor strategy , and many people credit it with the fast pace of technological advancements we ’ ve seen in the past . Because of Intel ’ s delays with 10nm , it has fallen behind this schedule . However , with 10nm out this year and 7nm out by 2021 , Intel is hoping it can catch up with Moore ’ s Law . Swan admits that the 2.7x scaling for 10nm was both too ambitious and too complicated . He also explains how Intel made an error when it “ prioritized performance at a time when predictability was really important ” . However , as Swan notes , “ The short story is we learned from it , we 'll get our 10nm node out this year . Our 7nm node will be out in two years and it will be a 2.0X scaling so back to the historical Moore 's Law curve . ” You can watch a recording of Swan 's appearance on Fortune 's website . So it looks like we ’ ll finally see 10nm chips from Intel this year , while 7nm will have to wait until 2021 . That ’ s a long time considering both AMD and Qualcomm have 7nm chips out right now . But will Intel be happy with ceding any performance advantage 7nm brings to its two biggest competitors for that long ? Via PC Gamer

Intel has accidentally leaked some codenames and details of its incoming discrete graphics cards , and also some Rocket Lake CPUs . This comes from a graphics driver spilled unintentionally by Intel , picked up on by an eagle-eyed Anandtech forum member . The leak comprised of the following model names ( and some clues therein ) for Intel ’ s Xe 10nm graphics cards which are expected to come out in 2020 : The ‘ DG ’ in the codename is likely to stand for ‘ discrete graphics ’ ( meaning a standalone GPU on a board , as opposed to an integrated graphics solution in a processor ) , and the ‘ LP ’ and ‘ HP ’ designations seemingly refer to low-power or high-power ( and therefore more powerful ) parts . But the really interesting bit is looking at the beefier high-power trio of GPUs , the number at the end of the codename could reportedly indicate the number of execution units ( EUs ) carried by the graphics card . That ’ s certainly our ( and everyone else ’ s ) best guess , and it would mean that these three graphics cards would utilize 128 , 256 and 512 EUs respectively . So , bear in mind that this is all speculation , but it seems that Intel ’ s initial Xe offerings target mid-range GPU territory , although we must also remember that we only have very small ( potentially errant ) pieces of information here in those numbers . Even if this guesswork is on the money , a lot will depend on the clock speed Intel is aiming for with these products . There ’ s chatter about higher clock speeds being targeted , such as base clocks of around 1800MHz or 1900MHz , and that could make Intel ’ s Xe competitive with Nvidia ’ s higher-end GeForce RTX cards . But we best not start drawing too much in the way of conclusions here , because this is all very sketchy . It ’ s nevertheless interesting to get a potential hint at how powerful these Xe GPUs might be , and given that they are due next year , it probably won ’ t be too long before we witness some benchmark leaks spilling out to give us a real indication of performance . Another exciting element pertaining to Xe graphics cards is Intel ’ s recent revelation that hardware ray tracing will be supported , in data center GPUs anyway – and hopefully by extension , consumer products ( which would again rival Nvidia ’ s RTX offerings ) . As mentioned at the outset , this driver leak also revealed a few nuggets of info about the integrated graphics of incoming Rocket Lake processors . Rocket Lake is Intel ’ s follow-up to Comet Lake , the latter being the chip giant ’ s next mainstream 10th-gen processors which we should also see next year , or perhaps even sooner , built on a revised 14nm+++ node , and coming with a potential Ryzen 9 3900X beater ( which could really turn things around for Intel ) . At any rate , Rocket Lake is expected in 2020 , and its Gen11 integrated graphics will arrive in GT0 , GT0.5 and GT1 variants , with the latter two running with 16 and 32 EUs respectively . There will also be a GT1 Pro spin , too . Via Tom ’ s Hardware

Intel just released its earnings for the second quarter of the 2019 fiscal year , and while the results beat analyst expectations and lead to an improved full-year outlook , it still shows a year-on-year drop . First , the good news : the results show revenues of $ 16.5 billion , which beat analyst estimates – Zacks Consensus Estimates expected $ 15.6 billion in revenue . Intel previously reduced its full-year revenue outlook to $ 69 billion , but following these results , Intel is raising it to $ 69.5 billion – an increase of $ 500 million . In a statement , Bob Swan , Intel ’ s CEO , said that “ Second quarter results exceeded our expectations on both revenue and earnings , as the growth of data and compute-intensive applications are driving customer demand for higher performance products in both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses . Based on our outperformance in the quarter , we ’ re raising our full-year guidance . ” During the second quarter , Intel ’ s PC-centric part of the business ( CCG ) rose by 1 % to $ 8.8 billion , which Intel says is thanks to the performance of its high-end ( and therefore more expensive ) products , as well as customers purchasing products ahead of any possible tariffs being imposed . Intel ’ s Internet of Things ( IoT ) business also continued to do very well , with a record quarterly revenue of $ 986 million – not too far off the $ 1 billion milestone . This is up 12 % compared to a year ago , driven by demand for higher performance processors . It seems with internet-connected smart devices getting ever more powerful and complex , Intel is the real winner . Operating income was also up $ 51 million to $ 294 million , while Mobileye revenue was up 16 % to $ 201 million . However , it ’ s not all good news , and as we mentioned , there was a year-on-year drop , with an operating income of $ 4.6 billion – a decline of 12 % year over year . Net income was $ 4.2 billion , which is a 17 % year-over-year decrease from the $ 5 billion it earned at the same point last year . Intel ’ s Datacenter group seems to be the biggest driver behind this drop , with a 10 % revenue drop for the second quarter . Operating income for the Datacenter group declined sharply – down 34 % from a year ago . The Non-Volatile Memory Solutions group also saw a drop of 13 % from last year , and the Programmable Solutions group ’ s revenue was down 5 % from last year . With a challenging market , and renewed competition from AMD , it ’ s been a mixed set of results for Intel . However , it appears the company is in good spirits and is looking towards the future , with Bob Swan promising that “ Intel 's ambitions are as big as ever , our collection of assets is unrivalled , and our transformation continues . ” The imminent release of Intel ’ s 10nm Ice Lake processors should hopefully see a boost to revenues , and the next set of results should also see the impact of Apple buying Intel ’ s 5G smartphone modem chip business for $ 1 billion .
Windows 10 users looking to move to the latest May 2019 Update – perhaps for security reasons , as we ’ ve recently seen – should be aware that the upgrade is being blocked for certain older Intel drivers . As Microsoft explains , there are compatibility issues with certain Intel Rapid Storage Technology drivers – between versions 15.1.0.1002 and 15.5.2.1053 – and the May 2019 Update . So if you ’ re running those versions of the Intel drivers , you won ’ t be able to install the latter . If you attempt to upgrade , you ’ ll receive a message informing you that : “ The inbox storage driver iastora.sys doesn ’ t work on these systems and causes stability problems on Windows . ” These drivers take care of various storage configuration tasks as you might imagine , and specifically Intel Optane memory and the maintenance of various RAID arrays ( RAID 0/1/5/10 ) . To remedy the problem , you obviously need to update your Intel drivers to at least version 15.5.2.1054 ( although the recommended version is a later build : 15.9.6.1044 ) . Of course , you really should update all your drivers as a matter of routine , anyway ( and be running the latest Optane firmware if you have one of Intel ’ s memory modules in your PC ) . The best way to update is via your hardware manufacturer – check its website – but failing that , as sometimes third-party vendors aren ’ t on the ball , you can get the relevant RST drivers directly from Intel here .

Apple is on its way to making a 5G iPhone with its own modem thanks to today 's $ 1 billion acquisition of a majority of Intel 's smartphone modem business . It 's another way in which Apple will assert end-to-end control over its devices . The Apple-Intel deal will see approximately 2,200 Intel employees join Apple , along with all-important intellectual property , equipment and leases , according to today 's official announcement . In the end , Apple will hold a combined 17,000 wireless technology patents . Despite what you may read , TechRadar is n't anticipating an Apple-made 5G modem inside the iPhone 11 or the iPhone 2020 – even the iPhone 2021 sounds far-fetched . The announcement marks the beginning of monumental task ahead for Apple . There will almost certainly be a 5G iPhone in the interim . Apple , after all , does have a six-year agreement with 5G modem supplier and chip maker Qualcomm . That 's how the 2020 iPhone will likely give Apple fans their first taste of 5G speeds . With today 's news , Apple will be able to wean itself off of the Qualcomm modem that is in many previous-generation iPhones and expedite the development of its own 5G smartphone modem , which is something Intel had struggled to do on its own . Currently , the iPhone XS , iPhone XS Max , and iPhone XR all have 4G LTE with Intel modems and that 's not expected to change with the forthcoming iPhone 11 series . Some iPhone 8 , iPhone 8 Plus , and iPhone X models have Qualcomm modem chips . Apple and Qualcomm agreed to stop suing each other back in April ( and Apple had to pay Qualcomm a hefty multi-million-dollar fine in the end ) . Today 's deal is likely more than just bad blood . Apple has had a habit of bringing tech in-house when it can – we expect Apple-designed ARM-based MacBook chips in 2021 , too . A series of 5G iPhone rumors point to the first iteration launching in 2020 . And yet this Apple-Intel deal wo n't close until the fourth quarter of 2019 , leaving the Apple less than a year to turnaround a 5G iPhone modem . It does n't give Apple very much time to develop its own modem , never mind a 5G version that competes with the Qualcomm modem chip already inside the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G . So it may still have to license modems from Qualcomm . We 've reached out to both Apple and Qualcomm for comment on the situation .

After Apple and Qualcomm 's long-lasting feud was finally settled , Intel decided to abandon its modem business as it had lost the hopes of producing 5G tech for future iPhones . However , now an article from the Wall Street Journal claims that the Cupertino tech giant is `` in advanced talks '' to buy Intel 's modem chip division within the next week , `` according to people familiar with the matter '' . Apple 's decision for making good with Qualcomm was largely driven by Intel 's inability to deliver a 5G-capable smartphone modem in time to satisfy Apple 's own roadmap for a 5G iPhone release . However Qualcomm was already ahead of the game , with its 2019 flagship smartphone processor , the Snapdragon 855 , being the first to be compatible with 5G connectivity thanks to an embedded modem . If the purchase does go ahead , Apple will be kickstarting its own foray into researching 5G technology , acquiring $ 1 billion worth of staff , patents and research that Intel accrued over the course of a decade . While the first wave of 5G iPhones will still likely use the established Qualcomm technology , Apple ’ s potential acquisition of Intel ’ s modem division could further the Cupertino firm ’ s push to bring as much iPhone production in-house as possible . Apple has taken increasing control over the years of the components that form its flagship products in order to avoid outsourcing where it can – the graphics chips in its iPhone and iPad lines are one such example , and rumors are all pointing to the company designing its own ARM-based processors for its Mac line-up . While the news of Apple acquiring Intel ’ s modem division is currently only rumored , it certainly does gel with the company ’ s intentions of late .

AMD 's latest Ryzen 3000 series of processors have done a brilliant job at challenging Intel 's dominance of the desktop processor market , but when it comes to laptop processors , it looks like Intel is still king , with the Core i7-1065G7 mobile chip beating the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X in certain benchmarks . Recently , benchmark results leaked for Intel ’ s 10th generation Ice Lake i7-1065G7 processor , which is designed for use in laptops . Despite it being a laptop chip – so there are power and heat implications – as the Techquila website notes , the benchmarks suggest that it will beat AMD ’ s new Ryzen 9 3900X . What ’ s particularly interesting is that the Ryzen 9 3900X is a desktop processor , which means it consumes more power ( 105W vs the i7-1065G7 ’ s 15W ) and runs at higher frequencies . In the leaked Geekbench scores , the Intel Ice Lake Core i7-1065G7 , running in a HP Spectre x360 laptop , manages a single-core score of 5,691 . Meanwhile , AMD ’ s flagship Ryzen 9 3900X flagship scores slightly lower at 5,624 . While that isn ’ t a huge difference , the fact that Intel ’ s new mobile processor appears to edge out AMD ’ s latest desktop flagship when it comes to single-core performance means AMD could struggle to produce mobile processors that rival Intel 's . Of course , when it comes to multi-core performance , the 12-core Ryzen 9 3900X handily beats the quad-core Intel 17-1065G7 with a score of 45,338 vs 17,741 . It ’ s worth noting that these benchmarks are not confirmed , but if they are real it tells us a few things . First of all , it seems like Intel could be getting its mojo back with laptop processors – with the Core i7-1065G7 producing some excellent results considering it ’ s a mobile processor . It also means that if AMD wants to steal Intel ’ s mobile crown , it has its work cut out . However , considering it ’ s recent form , we ’ re looking forward to what the company comes up with next .

Intel has revealed a new powerful AI solution codenamed Pohoiki Beach , which the chip giant boasts can crunch data up to 1,000 times faster than a general-purpose CPU . Pohoiki Beach is a complex neuromorphic system built from 64 Loihi research chips , and its architecture is crafted along the same lines as the human brain . With this new system , Intel promises not just to process information up to 1,000 times faster than your typical CPU , as already mentioned , but furthermore , even greater gains in terms of efficiency to the tune of a factor of 10,000 . Of course , this is for specific compute-intensive applications such as sparse coding , graph search and constraint-satisfaction , Intel advises . With real-world usage , this tech can be applied to a wide variety of scenarios , such as improving the performance of a powered robotic prosthetic leg – helping it deal with uneven ground underfoot – or indeed bettering the world of self-driving cars by facilitating more accurate digital maps for these autonomous vehicles . Intel further notes that Pohoiki Beach projects also include automating a foosball table with neuromorphic sensing and control , which sounds interesting , along with facilitating tactile input for the skin of an iCub robot . Pohoiki Beach is currently an 8 million neuron system , but Intel is looking to scale up to 100 million neurons before 2019 is out , so bigger and better things are to come with the data crunching power on tap . The company boasts : “ Later this year , Intel will introduce an even larger Loihi system named Pohoiki Springs , which will build on the Pohoiki Beach architecture to deliver an unprecedented level of performance and efficiency for scaled-up neuromorphic workloads . ” Via MIT Technology Review

AMD ’ s Ryzen processors have experienced a big sales spike following the launch of Ryzen 3000 products over in Asia , cutting deeply into Intel ’ s CPU turf , according to a fresh report . The report in question from Danawa Research ( highlighted by Wccftech ) observes that following the launch of Ryzen 3000 chips , AMD finally sold more processors than Intel . Going by figures from Danwa , a large South Korean retailer , just a few days after Ryzen 3000 products went on sale , AMD ’ s chips secured a market share of 53.36 % , over half the market and more than what Intel managed . In the couple of previous weeks , AMD ’ s market share had been hovering around from the mid-20 % to 40 % mark , so this represents a massive boost for Ryzen sales . That said , we need to take into account the usual caveats here : we can only put so much stock ( pun unintended ) in sales figures from a single retailer . Given the apparently highly variable AMD market share in the recent couple of weeks , we should treat this Asian source with even more caution than the German retailer Mindfactory , which is often cited as a barometer of European CPU sales ( and even the reliability of that source only goes so far , and has certainly been questioned ) . So take this news with a pinch of salt , in other words , although Wccftech uncovered a second Asian source , BCN Ranking , which compiles sales data from four major retailers in Japan . It found AMD ’ s market share has crept up to 50.5 % – just edging out Intel on 49.5 % . If we step back to October 2018 , Intel held 72.1 % of the market according to BCN – so again this is a big step up for AMD . Clearly , these findings on the popularity of CPUs in Asia are interesting , but perhaps not surprising given the critical acclaim bestowed on the new Ryzen products , and that includes our reviews here at TechRadar . AMD ’ s Ryzen 3000 doesn ’ t just compete on price ( which has always been the case ) , but also in terms of price/performance – and crucially power efficiency too ( a missing part of the puzzle , previously ) . It ’ s a triple threat to Intel , in short , as we ’ ve already made clear . There are some other interesting statistics from South Korean retailer Danwa , including the fact that the bestselling AMD chip is the new Ryzen 7 3700X with 10.34 % of sales . It ’ s only the second best CPU overall , though , with Intel leading the pack with its Core i5-9400 on 14.55 % . The retailer also observes that there is a massive skew in terms of interest – clicks , not sales , on the retailer ’ s website – in favor of AMD ’ s range of processors , with 77 % of users clicking on AMD ’ s chips as opposed to 23 % for Intel ’ s . That ’ s more than three-quarters of prospective buyers looking towards team red . These latest Asian figures , coupled with recent results from German retailer Mindfactory , would seem to indicate that Intel really needs to come up with something special in response to Ryzen 3000 . And indeed as we saw last week , according to a recent leak , that response might be a 10-core Comet Lake CPU to beat out the Ryzen 9 3900X . We can but hope this is the case , or something equally juicy to drive more competition in the CPU arena .

Intel has been losing ground to AMD for some time now in the processor world , and more so with the release of the Ryzen 3000 series of CPUs , which are incredibly competitive on all fronts – but Intel is prepping a beast of a Comet Lake response to this fresh threat , if the latest from the rumor mill is anything to go by . From the off , we should underline that this is mere speculation as picked up by Hot Hardware , which comes in the form of a leaked roadmap with some dubious details and question marks hanging over it . Still , if real , it shows how serious Intel is about combating the danger that Ryzen 3000 poses . The slide shared supposedly shows Intel ’ s roadmap for 10th-gen Comet Lake processors which are built on a revised 14nm+++ node . This range will be headed up by the Core i9-10900KF , a 10-core ( 20-thread ) CPU with a base clock of 3.4GHz and the ability to hit Turbo to 4.6GHz across all those cores ( and 5.2GHz on a single core ) . It will have a TDP of 105W , the leak claims . This chip will allegedly be priced at $ 499 ( around £400 , AU $ 715 ) , which funnily enough , is the price tag of the 12-core AMD Ryzen 9 3900X ( also running with a 4.6GHz boost , and a TDP of 105W too ) which just stormed onto the scene offering an incredible price/performance ratio ( and achieved full marks in our review , no less ) . This rumor further suggests that hyper-threading will return to the entire range of these 10th-gen Intel chips – even the low-end Core i3 quad-core models – and that the top-end Core i9 processors will not have an integrated GPU ( it will either not be present , or disabled , as presumably dispensing with it is necessary in terms of achieving a better yield ) . In all honesty , those final points seem rather unlikely , and moreover , the leak claims that these processors will use a new ‘ LGA 1159 ’ socket – so would that necessitate buyers also acquiring a new motherboard ? That prospect certainly seems unlikely , with the step to ramping up production of 10nm processors in the pipeline for Intel ’ s near future . As well as these concerns , the slide itself is a little strangely laid out and comes from an anonymous source ( via Twitter ) with no further clarification . And the alleged Core i9-10900KF seems to fit just a little too snugly in terms of its specs for going up against the Ryzen 9 3900X , with matching TDPs and turbo clocks ( not to mention the price – which is apparently exactly the same ) . So there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about this purported Intel slide , but that said , the model names of the chips ( and much of their overall base specs ) seem solid enough in terms of their potential validity . And it ’ s certainly believable that Intel will be wanting to pull something seriously compelling out of its silicon hat to gain back some of the CPU turf it has been losing to AMD of late . Intel used to be the dominant processor power , and going by one online retailer ’ s figures it still was at the beginning of 2018 , but that balance has since tipped so that AMD sold twice as many CPUs as Intel in March 2019 . And that picture could worsen with AMD ’ s new Ryzen 3000 line-up , which as we observed yesterday , sees the chip manufacturer beating Intel not just on price , where it has always been competitive , but also on performance and indeed power efficiency . A triple blow to Intel , if you like . One thing ’ s for sure : following all this slippage , and its well-known stock shortage issues of recent times , Intel will need to generate momentum from somewhere in order to stay competitive with the rapid progress AMD is making .

Thanks to the launch of the AMD Ryzen 3000 line up of processors , AMD is beating Intel on performance , power and price for the first time in 20 years . While Intel has enjoyed an easy dominance in the processor market for a while now , AMD ’ s latest chips will surely give its rival cause for concern . Thanks to the Ryzen 3000 series ’ new seven nanometer design , AMD has been able to make processors that beat equivalent Intel processors when it comes to performance , while having lower power consumption . Not only that , AMD ’ s processors beat Intel ’ s competitors when it comes to price as well . While AMD has always been highly competitive on price , this is the first time in two decades that the company has also managed to beat Intel on performance and power consumption as well . Reviews from various publications ( including our own ) all appear to agree that AMD ’ s Ryzen 3000 processors provide a real threat to Intel . We ’ re now at a point where if you ’ re looking at a specific Intel processor , if it has an AMD alternative , AMD ’ s chip will be more powerful , more power efficient and cheaper . Intel should be very worried . It looks like AMD could start gaining market share thanks to its new CPU and GPU releases , with MarketWatch reporting that AMD ’ s shares are up 2.1 % , and that this should produce “ solid ” June-quarter results and a “ strong outlook for the September period ” . This should lead to increasing market-share gains for AMD . While its competitors ( Intel on the CPU front , Nvidia when it comes to GPUs ) still have a clear market dominance ( especially when it comes to gaming PCs , as a recent Steam survey found ) , AMD ’ s results are definitely moving the company in the right direction . The future fight between Intel , Nvidia and AMD is certainly heating up – and very exciting to see .

The latest Steam Hardware & Software Survey is out , giving us a glimpse of what kind of rigs gamers are using when playing on Steam – and it looks like Windows 10 , Intel and Nvidia are dominating PC gaming hardware and software . While the Steam Hardware & Software Survey only logs Steam customers ( and ones who have opted into the survey ) , due to the huge popularity of Steam , it gives us an excellent idea of what kind of hardware and operating system PC gamers are using . Do n't forget – the Steam Summer Sale 2019 is currently running and is offering some brilliant deals on games . When it comes to operating system , Windows is by far the most popular OS , with a combined 96.49 % of gamers running a version of it . In contrast , only 2.75 % of respondents are running macOS , and just 0.76 % are running Linux . That last number is disappointing considering Valve ’ s ( the company behind Steam ) support for the open-source operating system , and news that Steam will no longer recommend using the next version of Ubuntu – the most popular Linux distro for gamers – might cause this number to drop further still in the future . Out of all the versions of Windows used by Steam customers , Windows 10 is the most widely used , with the 64-bit version installed on 70.92 % of PCs – an increase of 3.08 % . It looks like gamers are migrating from Windows 7 as it approaches its End of Life phase ( when it will no longer be supported by Microsoft ) , as use of the older operating system dropped by 2.09 % to 21.34 % . This will be welcome news to Microsoft , which is keen to get as many people to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 as possible . However , many PC gamers are still clinging on to Windows 7 . Microsoft will want to get them to upgrade before January 14 , 2020 , when it 's dropping support . When it comes to hardware , both Intel and Nvidia continue their dominance . For graphics cards , 75.53 % of Steam users run Nvidia GPUs , compared to 14.75 % of users who have an AMD card . Nvidia ’ s mid-range GeForce GTX 1060 is the most popular card , used by 16.01 % of respondents . In fact , Nvidia ’ s mid-range cards are by far the most popular . Of its latest cards , the RTX 2070 is the most popular , yet it ’ s only installed in 1.10 % of Steam users ' PCs . Meanwhile , its flagship GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is used in 0.42 % of Steam PCs . It seems that despite its dominance , Nvidia is n't convincing gamers to splash out big money on its latest high-end GPUs . Will the launch of the RTX 2060 Super and RTX 2070 Super cards change this ? Meanwhile , the most popular AMD card with Steam users is the AMD Radeon RX 580 , which is installed in 1.32 % of Steam user ’ s PCs . As far as processors are concerned , Intel has easily kept its market-leading position , with 82.01 % of Steam users having one of its processors , compared to AMD ’ s 17.88 % . These results will be disappointing for AMD – and its fans . Despite the company releasing a number of excellent products for both CPU and GPU , it looks like it ’ s still struggling for market share . Its CPU results are particularly concerning , as there ’ s been a drop of 0.13 percentage points since May . We like a bit of competition in the market , so seeing Microsoft , Intel and Nvidia continue their domination is a bit concerning , but credit where it ’ s due : these companies have done well to continue to make products that are appealing to gamers .

After announcing that it will exit the 5G modem market back in April , Intel has put its IP related to cellular wireless connectivity up for auction as the chipmaker looks to unload around 8,500 assets from its massive portfolio . Although the company supplied 4G modem chips for Apple 's iPhone for the last few years , it has struggled to release a 5G modem in time for the global rollout of the next generation of wireless technology . Intel 's auction will be divided into two parts and bidders will be able to make an offer for its cellular portfolio or its connected device portfolio . The chipmaker 's cellular portfolio contains approximately 6,000 patent assets related to 3G , 4G and 5G cellular standards as well as an additional 1,700 assets related to wireless implementation technologies . Intel 's connected device portfolio on the other hand is much smaller and is made up of 500 patents with broad applications for the semiconductor and electronics industries . The auction process is being handled by Nader Mousavi of Sullivan & Cromwell and Intel expects to begin accepting non-binding indications of interest from bidders in August . According to IAM , Intel will launch the auction process for its wireless IP separately from its current efforts to sell its smartphone modem business . However , a prospective buyer could acquire both its IP and modem business . The company may have struggled to bring a 5G product to market but it has still made great strides in building one of the most robust patent portfolios in the mobile sector . We 'll likely find out more once we get closer to start of the auction but either way , Intel 's decision to sell of its patents related to cellular wireless connectivity will have huge ramifications on the industry as a whole .

The release of Intel 's 10th Gen chips has seen many device manufacturers release updated versions of their most popular laptops and now Lenovo is following suit with the launch of new ThinkPads that will feature the chip giant 's latest processors . However , design-wise these new laptops are quite similar to the company 's previous models , though they do feature better specs and some sport Intel 's Project Athena label which means they 're guaranteed to provide at least nine hours of battery life . The new seventh generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon will include Intel 's 10th Gen Comet Lake chips with options for a Core i5 , Core i7 and even a hexacore Core i7 processor . The device is also one of the laptops that will include Intel 's Project Athena label which will likely please power users looking to get more work done on a single charge . The ThinkPad X1 Yoga is also getting a similar update and the device will now include either a 10th Gen Core i5 or i7 processor . Unlike the X1 Carbon , it wo n't be getting Intel 's Project Athena label and for the most part the ThinkPad X1 Yoga retains the design of its predecessor . Lenovo also announced that the ThinkPad T490 and X390 will also be getting new chips with the option of either a Core i5 or Core i7 processor . Just like the rest of devices announced by the company , these two laptops will feature a similar design to their predecessors . The two devices getting the most substantial update are Lenovo 's ThinkPad L13 and L13 Yoga . The new models are an update to the older L390 model and the devices will now offer a thinner and lighter design . Lenovo has also reworked the ThinkPad L13 and L13 Yoga with brighter displays , smaller bezels , a sliding “ ThinkShutter ” integrated webcam cover and there is also an optional IR camera for Windows Hello available . Users will even have the option to outfit their L13 or L13 Yoga with Intel 's 10th Gen chips . However , cheaper less powerful chips such as Intel 's Celeron processors will also be available . Every new generation of processor does n't necessarily warrant a design overhaul and Lenovo has delivered a range of new devices with updated processors that feature the design and form factor users already expect from a ThinkPad .

Intel recently made a huge splash with the release of its Comet Lake processors for laptops and tablets , but that doesn ’ t mean it ’ s done . Hong Kong-based website , XFastest , recently shared three leaked slides from an anonymous source showing an Intel Core platform boasting a new Intel 400 series chipset and an LGA 1200 socket . To top that off , these slides also include a roadmap indicating that the 10-core Comet Lake CPUs for desktop computers are slated to roll out in the first quarter of 2020 . Based on the slides , this new chipset looks to be designed to support up to 10-core and 20-thread processors . The platform details also suggest that the enthusiast level TDP is seeing a bump of up to 125W from the previous 95W for enhanced core & memory overclocking . According to ExtremeTech , Intel might be trying to avoid cutting the base clock speed as it did when moving from the 8th to 9th generations as well . The updated LGA 1200 socket and Intel 400 series chipset means that you ’ ll need to buy a new motherboard with these specs if you want to upgrade once the Comet Lake-S processors come out . However , jumping on board with the Comet Lake-S also includes integrated support for 802.11ax , the next generation of wireless support also known as Wi-Fi6 . With the potential roll-out of the Comet Lake desktop processors coming the beginning of 2020 , there will be plenty more speculation on what to expect . While we ’ re still hoping for slimmer CPU ’ s from Intel to compete with AMD ’ s 7nm offerings , it has decided to stick with their tried-and-true 14nm process . Of course , we ’ ll have to wait and see how Comet Lake-S compares to AMD ’ s newest Ryzen options , which already go up to 16 cores and 32 threads . Intel has always led with its single core performance , and we ’ re excited to see how Comet Lake-S improves upon its already powerful results . And , while AMD will probably still outperform Intel in the multi-core department , maybe the extra 2 cores and increased TDP will close the gap . The true test for most people will be price . There ’ s no information on that yet , Intel might try and shake up AMD ’ s top-flight offerings . Whatever the prices end up being , we ’ ll keep you up to date on Comet Lake-S news .
The rumor mill has previously insisted that AMD has a Ryzen 5 3500 ( as well as other chips ) waiting in the wings , and now a prolific hardware leaker has spilled the apparent specs of the CPU – which , if correct , make the processor look like a worrying prospect for Intel . This comes from TUM_APISAK ( the source of plenty of CPU leakage ) who aired the details on Twitter . Ryzen 5 35006C/6T4.1/3.6 GhzAugust 23 , 2019 So we are apparently looking at a six-core ( six-thread – meaning there is no simultaneous multi-threading here ) processor , with a base clock of 3.6GHz and boost to 4.1GHz . Previous speculation has indicated a TDP of 65W , which would make sense based on AMD ’ s existing models . When AMD first announced the Ryzen 3000 line-up , we thought it was a bit odd that there was no budget offering , so presumably this will be exactly that , sitting below the existing AMD Ryzen 5 3600 ( currently the lowest spec Zen 2-based processor , which has six cores but 12-threads , and the same TDP and base speed , but it boosts to 4.2GHz ) . That existing chip is priced at $ 199 ( around £162 , AU $ 295 ) , so this fresh 3500 product would obviously have to undercut that by a decent amount . AMD might be looking at a relatively affordable $ 150 ( around £122 , AU $ 220 ) or so , which would pitch the alleged Ryzen 5 3500 up against Intel ’ s popular Core i5-9400 , also a six-core ( six-thread ) CPU with boost to 4.1GHz , but a slower base clock of 2.9GHz . That Intel part is priced around $ 180 ( around £147 , AU $ 265 ) – although you can get the non-integrated graphics version , the 9400F , for more like $ 150 or so , looking at online prices at the time of writing . So , the theory is that AMD would be looking at competitively pricing this chip against Intel ’ s Core i5-9400 , and the very similar i5-9500 ( although that offers boost to 4.4GHz ) . However , as Tom ’ s Hardware notes ( and has argued previously ) , there is a chance that this Ryzen 5 3500 may be a successor to the Ryzen 5 2500X , and thus supplied to OEMs only . In other words , you will only get it in pre-built PCs , rather than being able to buy it off the shelf on its own . Hopefully that won ’ t be the case though , because it would be nice – and it would make sense – for the Ryzen 3000 range to get a budget option as a standalone product . If it is indeed incoming , AMD ’ s Ryzen 5 3500 would likely be more than competitive with rival Intel offerings , because the performance battle is not just fought on pure clock speeds . The chip reportedly has much more cache than Intel ’ s i5s , AMD ’ s Zen 2 architecture offers a considerable IPC ( instructions per clock ) boost , and there are other features like Ryzen ’ s PCIe 4.0 support to consider .

Intel ’ s purportedly incoming Core i9 Cascade Lake-X 10-core processor could struggle to compete with rival chips from AMD , at least going by a freshly leaked benchmark . The supposed Core i9 10000 X Cascade Lake-X , a 10-core high-end desktop ( HEDT ) processor , was spotted by prolific leaker @ momomo_us in the Geekbench database of results . Geekbench 4Dell Inc . Precision 5820 Tower X-SeriesIntel 0000 10C/20T @ 3.40 - 4.60 GHzGenuineIntel Family 6 Model 85 Stepping 7https : //t.co/KBn1BpgCGS pic.twitter.com/231hDiVScNAugust 15 , 2019 The chip shows up with a base frequency of 3.4GHz and Turbo to 4.6GHz , in a Dell Precision 5820 workstation PC , recording a single-core result of 5,019 , and multi-core of 37,241 . The model details correspond with the recent 18-core Cascade Lake-X Geekbench leak – and that beefier CPU was also benchmarked in a Dell Precision 5820 – giving the authenticity of the new leak a bit more weight . At any rate , the results don ’ t look too promising at first glance , certainly on the single-core front anyway . Multi-core looks somewhat better at 37,241 , which would make this theoretical successor to the Core i9-9900X ( 10-core ) on about the same level – which does n't bode well for a generational successor . Still , we ca n't put too much stock in these leaked benchmark results . Matters get distinctly less impressive when you consider AMD ’ s silicon , with the Ryzen Threadripper 2950X is almost as fast in Geekbench 4 multi-core when we reviewed it , hitting 36,880 , only a percentage point off Intel or thereabouts . Of course , that Threadripper chip is a year old now , and AMD ’ s new Ryzen 9 3900X ( 3rd-gen mainstream processor ) outdoes both that AMD CPU and this leaked Intel HEDT processor ( as we saw in our review where it blasted way over 40,000 in multi-core ) . That ’ s when you have to step back and perhaps let out a long and weighty ‘ hmmm ’ … Our components editor , Bill Thomas , notes that `` the Intel Core i9-9900X comes in around $ 989 ( £989 , AU $ 1,499 ) . If this rumored follow-up processor ca n't dethrone a mainstream AMD processor that costs half as much , Intel might be in trouble . '' Of course , there ’ s something of a minefield of caveats here . This is just a leak and the benchmark could somehow be awry , or it could be an early ( relatively hobbled ) engineering sample of the Cascade Lake-X 10-core processor – or it could just be completely fake . So , we clearly have to be cautious about comparing this benchmark to our review results , and not get carried away here . Even if this leak is on the money , it ’ s still just a single benchmark , and that hardly tells the full story . All that said , this is hinting at a disappointing picture for the 10-core Intel HEDT offering , although expectations for Cascade Lake-X have not been set all that high anyway . Of course , Intel is still trying to eke as much as it can out of 14nm here , and that ’ s likely becoming an increasingly difficult task . So in that light , what we ’ re seeing here could make sense – but we ’ d be foolish to draw any real conclusions yet . Via Notebook Check

Microsoft is continuing its broad ongoing push to contribute with open source projects , joining the newly created Confidential Computing Consortium , an initiative launched by The Linux Foundation which aims to provide better security for data which is actually in use by apps on a computer , or in the cloud ( as opposed to at rest , or not being used ) . Microsoft is far from alone in this endeavor , and is joined by Intel in the consortium , along with ARM , Baidu , Google Cloud , IBM , Red Hat and other tech giants . The overarching aim is the adoption of ‘ confidential computing ’ and the use of Trusted Execution Environments ( TEEs ) to secure data which is actively being used . The Linux Foundation explains : “ Current approaches in cloud computing address data at rest and in transit but encrypting data in use is considered the third and possibly most challenging step to providing a fully encrypted lifecycle for sensitive data . “ Confidential computing will enable encrypted data to be processed in memory without exposing it to the rest of the system and reduce exposure for sensitive data and provide greater control and transparency for users . ” In other words , the operating system could be compromised by some kind of malware , but the data being used in a program would still be encrypted , and therefore safe from an attacker . There are a number of central elements going towards achieving this , and Microsoft ’ s contribution is its Open Enclave SDK , an open source framework that facilitates the building ( and verifying ) of hardware-protected trusted apps . These TEE-toting apps will be able to run across multiple hardware architectures , currently including Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone ( and Linux and Windows on the software front ) . The SGX ( Software Guard Extensions ) SDK is a big part of the puzzle which Intel is open sourcing here , along with Red Hat Enarx , which provides hardware independence when it comes to securing apps via TEEs . The latter is similar to Open Enclave , but unsurprisingly with more of a Linux focus . The ultimate end goal here should be better security for important data across the board , broadly speaking , and while this consortium and its aims obviously have a business focus , remember it ’ s often your personal data that these big organizations are processing and crunching . So , in a very real way when it comes to data breaches and the like , it ’ s often your security that is at stake . Mark Russinovich , chief technical officer at Microsoft , enthused : “ The Open Enclave SDK is already a popular tool for developers working on Trusted Execution Environments , one of the most promising areas for protecting data in use . “ We hope this contribution to the Consortium can put the tools in even more developers ’ hands and accelerate the development and adoption of applications that will improve trust and security across cloud and edge computing . ” Via Tom ’ s Hardware
With IFA 2019 on the horizon , plenty of computer manufacturers are taking the opportunity to upgrade their popular products . Now , Asus has done just that with new versions of three of its ZenBook laptops , which will come with AMD mobile processors ( CPUs ) . Asus 's ZenBook models are thin and light Ultrabooks with premium designs and the occasional high-end feature , like thin bezels , fingerprint scanners , or even special trackpads that have extra functions . But , for the most part , they 've run on Intel processors . Now , two ZenBook 14 models will get Ryzen mobile processor options and one ZenBook Flip 14 will as well . The configurations available are all quad-core CPUs , and will be either Ryzen 7 3700U or Ryzen 5 3500U CPUs . They also feature integrated Radeon Vega Graphics . It 's worth noting that even though these processors have the same naming scheme as Ryzen 3000-series , they use the older Zen+ architecture and not the new 7nm ( nanometer ) Zen 2 architecture . These updates come at the same time as plenty of other manufacturers ' product revisions . But , the upgrades that have stood out most in recent days have actually been for laptops with Intel insides . HP refreshed its Pavilion gaming laptop and desktop with options for AMD processors . But , with the release of a series of Intel Comet Lake CPUs , the bigger news has been the machines that include the new hardware . Dell put Intel Comet Lake processors into its XPS 13 and Inspiron devices , and MSI made the move to include Comet Lake chips in three new laptops . These are all machines that the Asus ZenBook models are likely to run up against in competition . Asus may win some aspects of the competition , with incredibly thin screen bezels and a chic design . But , the six-core option available from Intel 's Comet Lake processors will likely outperform the Ryzen options coming to the ZenBook line . This will differentiate the computers for those that need sheer performance . The Ryzen processors may help Asus keep the price of the new ZenBook models lower than the competition , though . We do n't currently have prices on the models , so we 'll have to wait and see .

Intel has unveiled two new CPUs designed for large computing centers which will be the chipmaker 's first to utilize artificial intelligence ( AI ) . The two chips are the company 's first offerings from its Nervana Neural Network Processor ( NPP ) line and one will be used to train AI systems while the other will handle inference . The Nervana NNP-T , codenamed Spring Crest , will be used for training and comes with 24 Tensor processing clusters that have been specifically designed to power neural networks . Intel 's new system on a chip ( SoC ) provides users with everything they 'll need to train an AI system on dedicated hardware . The Nervana NNP-I , codenamed Spring Hill , is the company 's inference SoC that uses its 10 nanometer process technology along with Ice Lake cores to help users deploy trained AI systems . Intel 's new AI-focused SoCs are designed to handle AI workloads in data center environments so that users no longer have to rely on just its Xeon CPUs to handle AI and machine learning tasks . The Nervana NNP-T and NNP-I were designed to compete with Google 's Tensor Porcessing Unit , Nvidia 's NVDLA-based tech and Amazon 's AWS Inferentia chips . Vice president and general manager of Intel 's Artificial Intelligence Products Group , Naveen Rao explained how the company 's new processors will help facilitate a future where AI is everywhere , saying : “ To get to a future state of ‘ AI everywhere , ’ we ’ ll need to address the crush of data being generated and ensure enterprises are empowered to make efficient use of their data , processing it where it ’ s collected when it makes sense and making smarter use of their upstream resources . Data centers and the cloud need to have access to performant and scalable general purpose computing and specialized acceleration for complex AI applications . In this future vision of AI everywhere , a holistic approach is needed—from hardware to software to applications . ” Via The Inquirer
The latest Intel Comet Lake CPUs are popping up all over the place this week after their announcement during Gamescom 2019 , and now MSI has unveiled a series of laptops that will include the new hardware . The new laptops coming from MSI are the Prestige 14 , Prestige 15 , and Modern 14 . These are machines focused on creative professionals who have just as much need for high performance internals as need for sharp , color-accurate displays . That 's just what MSI is promising with the new machines , and at the heart of that experience is the new Intel processors . Intel just announced Comet Lake Y-Series and U-Series processors that serve as the 10th generation of its Core lineup . And , the Comet Lake chips are still built on a 14nm ( nanometer ) process , but step up performance and efficiency . MSI 's new machines will feature up to the Intel Core i7-10710U , the highest-spec model announced so far , which features six cores , 12 thread , 12MB of cache , a 1.1GHz base clock and a single-core boost up to 4.7GHz . Beyond the Intel CPUs , the Prestige and Modern laptops still have plenty to offer . All of them at thin and light . On the light end , the Modern 14 weighs just 2.62 pounds , while the Prestige 15 tips the scales at 3.64 pounds . All three laptops share another thing in common : thickness . Despite varying screen sizes , all three measure just 16mm thick . In spite of that , they pack plenty of power . Both Prestige models support up to Nvidia GTX 1650 Max-Q graphics , while the Modern 14 can include GeForce MX250 graphics . Color accuracy is another serious element of these products . The Prestige models include up to 4K Ultra HD displays with 100 % coverage of the AdobeRGB color space , while the Modern 14 's Full HD display can hit 100 % coverage of the sRGB color space . The new laptops are available for pre-order at Newegg , with the Modern 14 starting at a stunningly low $ 749 ( about £615 , AU $ 1,100 ) .
Dell is n't waiting until the holiday season to bring Intel 's new 10th-Generation Comet Lake processors ( CPUs ) to some of its most popular mobile devices . We already knew about the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 getting 10-nanometer ( nm ) Ice Lake insides , and now Dell has announced upgrades to the clamshell XPS 13 and Inspiron laptops , which will feature new 14nm Comet Lake CPUs . Intel 's new Comet Lake CPUs are power-focused , with high performance available in the U-Series processors . These can feature up to six cores and 12 threads , with up to 12MB of cache , single-core boost speeds up to 4.9GHz , and support for up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports . This makes the processors productivity-friendly , and thus a perfect fit for one of the best laptops on the market . Here 's a look at all the U-Series Comet Lake processors : Intel 's Ice Lake processors are already available in the XPS 13 2-in-1 , which starts at $ 999 ( about £900 , AU $ 1,500 ) in the US . The new XPS 13 will become available on August 27 for $ 899 ( about £750 , AU $ 1,350 ) in the US . The new XPS 13 models can be fitted with any of the four U-Series Comet Lake processors and support 4GB to 16GB of LPDDR3 memory . The new laptop 's 13.3-inch display also boasts 400 nits of brightness , Full HD or 4K Ultra HD resolutions , 100 % sRGB coverage and support for Dolby Vision . With all of that , the XPS 13 still manages to stay under 2.7 pounds . Inspiron models are also coming in short order . The new Inspiron 7000 , 5000 and 3000 models will launch as soon as this month with the new processors , and that includes sizes ranging from 13 inches to 17 inches , the Inspiron 27 7000 All-in-One , and some 2-in-1 laptop models . Pricing starts from $ 389 ( about £330 , AU $ 580 ) on the low end ( Inspiron 3000 14-inch ) . However , not all models will launch at the same time , with some coming later in the year – see Dell 's blog for more details .
Intel has just detailed a large number of new processors ( CPUs ) in its 10th generation of Intel Core hardware . These include U- and Y-series Intel Comet Lake processors for laptops and 2-in-1 tablets . Aside from the main upgrades , like increased performance , the hardware also comes with support for a number of extra features , such as modern networking capabilities and improved graphics . Front and center in the announcement is Intel 's powerful new U-Series mobile processors in the Comet Lake family . These are still built on a 14-nanometer ( nm ) process – as opposed to Intel 's other 10-Generation mobile processor family , Ice Lake – but Intel is setting them up to deliver increased performance while maintaining battery-friendly power budgets . The new chips have a thermal design power ( TDP ) threshold of 7 watts ( W ) and 15W , though device makers can use the CPUs configured up to 25W . The new , 10th-Gen Intel Core mobile processors will boast up to six cores and 12 threads , up to 12MB of low-latency cache , and max boost frequencies up to 4.9GHz . The chips will also support up to four Thunderbolt 3 ( USB-C ) ports , DDR4-2666 memory , and the latest Wi-Fi 6 connectivity for over Gigabit speeds . Intel claims up to a 16 % boost in overall performance over 9th-Gen U-Series processors , and more than double the performance of five-year-old hardware . Here are the new U-Series Comet Lake CPUs in full : For particularly thin laptops ( and many 2-in-1 Windows tablets ) focused less on performance and more on efficiency as well as portability through fanless cooling solutions , the Y-Series Comet Lake processors are also updated . The most notable upgrade here is the introduction of quad-core processing to Intel 's fanless CPU design . Starting with the i5 parts , these Y-Series CPUs conists of four cores and eight threads , but have far lower TDPs , going as low as 4.5W . This allows for laptop and 2-in-1 tablet designs without any fans for cooling inside at all . These processors all have low starting clocks , but can boost to over 4GHz on a single core to offer heightened performance as needed . This will be nice in a pinch perhaps , but these chips still wo n't compare to Intel 's own U-Series parts in terms of boosted performance . Here are the new Y-Series Comet Lake CPUs in full : These new Comet Lake CPUs are expected to appear in over 90 laptops and 2-in-1 tablets by the holiday season this year . Expect to see TechRadar reviews of Intel Comet Lake devices in the coming months .
Intel has been talking up its processors at Gamescom 2019 , hosting an event where it admits that AMD , its chief rival , has “ done a great job closing the gap , but we still have the highest performing CPUs . ” If that sounds a little defensive to you , we agree . We were at the event in Cologne , Germany , and there was a bit of a feeling that Intel wanted to remind everyone that while AMD has been getting a lot of positive news lately thanks to its new Ryzen 3000 series of processors , when it comes to gaming , Intel still has the best processors . At the event , Intel ’ s Troy Severson said that “ when we introduced the i9 9900K… it was dubbed the fastest gaming CPU in the world . And I can honestly say nothing ’ s changed . It ’ s still the fastest gaming CPU in the world . ” Holding an event to essentially say that ‘ nothing ’ s changed ’ and ‘ we ’ re still the best ’ felt a little odd , and we ( and many others ) left feeling that Intel was a bit rattled by AMD ’ s recent success . At one point , it even talked about how it was sending anthropologists to live with gamers to study their habits – which does n't sound like a job we 'd fancy doing . Severson compared the Core i9 9900K to the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X in , what he stressed was “ real-world testing ” and highlighted how games compare on the similarly-priced processors , with the i9 9900K having the edge , despite having fewer cores than the 3900X ( eight cores versus 12 cores ) . However , as Dave James of PCGamesN observes , the fact that AMD has a processor with more cores and similar performance to Intel ’ s chip for the same price is one of the reasons why AMD is enjoying such positive headlines . At the event , Intel showed us slides that compared gaming performance of the Ryzen 7 3700U against its 10th generation Intel Core Ice Lake processor . Both these chips are low powered ( 25W ) processors designed for use in laptops , and the slides showed the Intel chip having a slight edge in most – but not all – games . Intel also highlighted how its previous generation Intel Core i5-8300H entry level mobile processor offers the same or better gaming performance than AMD ’ s new Ryzen 7 3750H . The event also saw Intel showcase its Intel Performance Maximizer tool , which will automatically overclock unlocked 9th generation Intel Core processors for an easy boost to performance . So , while Intel concedes that AMD is doing well , it ’ s also keen to underline how it ’ s still the king when it comes to gaming performance . Could this be a sign that AMD ’ s success is putting pressure on Intel ? We hope so – as Intel is at its best when it ’ s being challenged . As Severson said , “ Don ’ t get me wrong , AMD has made massive strides catching up , but the 9900K is still the best processor for gaming . ”

While the Cascade Lake Xeon CPUs has been out for a few months now , Intel still hasn ’ t shared any concrete information regarding Cascade Lake-X . However , this recent leak could indicate that , despite delays , Intel is gearing up to roll these long overdue high-end desktop ( HEDT ) chips soon . Hot off the heels of its Ice Lake chips release , Intel looks like it has no plans of slowing down . Tom ’ s Hardware recently reported that another possible Cascade Lake-X processor ( CPU ) has made an appearance on the Internet . An unknown processor with the codename , Intel 0000 , appeared in the Geekbench 4 database on August 16 inside a Dell Precision 5820 Workstation . According to Geekbench ’ s benchmarking data , this CPU boasts 18 cores and 36 threads , putting it in the perfect position to succeed the Intel Core i9-9980XE . Bearing the Stepping 7 identifier , Tom ’ s Hardware thinks that this chip could be an 18-core Cascade Lake-X processor . Not much else is known about this mysterious Intel 0000 chip . What we do know is that it boasts 18 cores , 36 threads and a base clock speed of 2.19 GHz . Although that base clock – as well as that 3.28 GHz maximum boost clock – is a tad worrying , it might just be that Geekbench 4 made a mistake identifying them . That , or the chip is still in its early stages . Either way , it ’ s already looking promising . It appears to outmatch the Intel Core i9-9980XE by 3.36 % in single-core workloads and about 7.4 % in multi-core workloads , beating out i9-9980XE ’ s 5,212 ( single-core ) and 50,837 ( multi-core ) benchmark results , again indicating that it could replace the Skylake-X Refresh flagship . If it is still being fine-tuned by Intel , we may be looking at an even better performance that could rival or even eclipse whatever AMD has in store with their 3rd-generation Ryzen Threadripper .

A fresh leak has popped up , suggesting that Intel is planning a ‘ Phantom Canyon ’ compact gaming PC , possibly out in 2020 , which will pack discrete graphics in the form of an RTX 2060 , or a GTX 1660 Ti . To be precise , this will be an NUC ( Next Unit of Computing ) or miniaturized PC to follow on from the successor to the current Intel Hades Canyon ( to give you an idea of the dimensions involved , that model is 8.7 x 5.6 x 1.54 inches ) . The sequel to Hades Canyon is Ghost Canyon , which should be unleashed later this year , with a Core i9-9980HK processor and unspecified discrete graphics ( as opposed to the integrated graphics seen on Hades Canyon – which were actually AMD-powered in the form of the Radeon RX Vega M GH ) . According to leaked presentation slides and info gathered by Tech Powerup , Phantom Canyon will follow Ghost Canyon either late in 2020 , maybe even early 2021 , and will have a Tiger Lake CPU ( a 28W part ) with Gen 12 integrated graphics ( Xe graphics ) and PCIe Gen 4 . As mentioned , the discrete graphics are labeled in the slide as either the RTX 2060 , or GTX 1660 Ti , with perhaps options on either . While an RTX 2060 sounds pretty powerful right now – for a small gaming box – if the release date of this NUC slides to 2021 , it may not seem like quite such a big leap . Another interesting point is that apparently we ’ re looking at Intel ’ s Xe graphics as the integrated solution , but not a discrete Xe offering , which you would think the company might want to showcase given that they ’ re arriving in 2020 . Perhaps the timeframe didn ’ t quite work out here , which may point to a greater likelihood of seeing the Phantom Canyon box hit shelves in 2020 rather than the following year ( as that would seemingly make things tighter with Intel ’ s Xe launch ) . Other interesting specs the leak highlights include Wi-Fi 6 , which you would expect , and a ‘ custom vapor chamber ’ on cooling duties , as doubtless cramming in that discrete GPU will call for some nifty trickery in terms of keeping temperatures down .

Intel Ice lake 10 nanometer processors have just been launched , and the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 ( 2019 ) is one of the first laptops to benefit from Intel 's new tech . This is exciting news , as the Dell XPS 13 is – in our opinion – the best laptop in the world right now , so now that the 2-in-1 version has been upgraded with the latest 10nm Intel Ice Lake processors , it means the best laptop has just got better . The new processors will bring a significant power boost to the XPS 13 2-in-1 . Intel ’ s Ice Lake processors feature a smaller and more efficient 10nm Sunny Cove architecture , Intel claims a 2x performance boost . The new CPUs also feature Intel ’ s next-generation Gen11 graphics , which gives the XPS 13 a noticeable upgrade when it comes to graphics performance as well . What ’ s perhaps most impressive is that the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 uses the full U-series of Ice Lake processors . Previous XPS 13 models used the lower-powered Y-series of Intel CPUs . By switching to the U-series , the XPS 13 will no longer have compromised performance – and for the first time will also feature quad-core processors . The new processors aren ’ t the only changes made to the Dell XPS 13 . It now comes with a new MagLev keyboard , which uses magnets to make the keys feel more satisfying and comfortable to type on , even with the XPS 13 ’ s shallow keyboard . The Dell XPS 13 will come with a choice of Ice Lake processors : the Intel Core i3-1005G1 ( 8MB cache , up to 3.4GHz ) , the Intel Core i5-1035G1 ( 6MB cache , up to 3.7GHz ) , and Intel Core i7-1065G7 ( 8MB cache , up to 3.9GHz ) – with that final CPU also featuring Intel ’ s Iris Plus graphics . You can also configure them with up to 32GB of RAM , a 1TB SSD and 4K InfinityEdge display . They are on sale now , starting at $ 999 ( around £820 , AU $ 1,500 ) . We ’ ve asked Dell for a review unit , so we ’ ll let you know our thoughts on the upgraded XPS 13 2-in-1 as soon as we get our hands on it .

Researchers have warned thatr Intel hardware may have another major security vulnerability , potentially putting millions of devices around the world at risk . The security team at Bitdefender claim that `` every machine '' that uses an Intel processor and that runs Windows , Linux or FreeBSD is impacted by the vulnerability , which comes just months after the hugely damaging Spectre and Meltdown scares . The company says that both enterprise and home users will be affected , as laptops , PCs and servers are all susceptible to the flaw . The vulnerability takes advantage of a flaw in Intel 's hardware protection to open up a side-channel attack that would give attackers a way in to access all information in the operating system kernel memory . It does so by exploiting a feature known as 'speculative execution ' , which aims to speed up a device 's CPU by getting it to make educated guesses as to which instructions might come next . However speculative execution can leave traces in-cache , which attackers can hijack to gain access into systems and the data within . This new flaw bypasses all protections implemented after the discovery of Spectre and Meltdown in early 2018 , meaning it can affect previously patched systems . “ Criminals with knowledge of these attacks would have the power to uncover the most vital , best-protected information of both companies and private individuals around the world , and the corresponding power to steal , blackmail , sabotage and spy , ” said Gavin Hill , vice president , datacenter and network security products at Bitdefender . “ Research into these attacks is on the cutting edge as it gets to the very roots of how modern CPUs operate and requires a thorough understanding of CPU internals , OS internals , and speculative-execution side-channel attacks in-general . ” Bitdefender says it has worked with Intel to create a fix for the flaw , which is available to download now . It added that ecosystem partners such as Microsoft and Linux has also patched the vulnerbaility , but users should ensure their systems are up to date immediately .

When you 're setting out to build a new PC , there are a couple things you need to take into consideration – if you 're getting an AMD processor , you have to use a motherboard and a cooler that are compatible . Well , not anymore . Enter the Asrock X570 Phantom Gaming-ITX , an AMD motherboard that supports an Intel cooler and Thunderbolt 3 . That latter point is especially important , as the Asrock X570 Phantom Gaming-ITX is one of the first AMD motherboards that supports the standard , which was previously an Intel-exclusive feature . Now , just taking a look at the motherboard , it looks like the cooler compatibility is the way it is because of the rectangular shape of AMD coolers , where Intel coolers are square . There is n't much room on this motherboard for a cooler because , well , it 's a mini-ITX board – the smallest form-factor for a motherboard . This is coupled with the fact that X570 motherboards in general have more robust VRM ( voltage regulator module ) cooling , and thus less room , thanks to the increased power requirements that its new features require . Before you go out and just buy the first Intel-compatible cooler , you should keep in mind that , because Intel and AMD chips are different sizes , there wo n't be universal compatibility . Our advice ? Check Asrock 's official list of supported CPU coolers and pick from those . However , having Thunderbolt 3 on an AMD platform is huge . Thunderbolt 3 offers much higher data bandwidth than standard USB 3.2 connection – up to 40Gb/s ( Gigabits per second ) , compared to USB 3.2 's 5Gb/s . Previously , this technology was exclusive to Intel processors because , well , Intel made it . At the end of the day , we could take or leave the cooler compatibility – its neat , and its interesting to see , but the Thunderbolt 3 compatibility is important , and could potentially lead to wider adoption of the standard across the computing world . We would love to start seeing AMD laptops supporting the standard , as it could loosen Intel 's chokehold on the Ultrabook market . Via ExtremeTech

A recent interview with Raja Koduri , senior vice president of architecture at Intel , caused a flurry of excitement when it seemed he was suggesting that the Intel Xe graphics card could take on Nvidia and AMD with a super-competitive $ 200 price tag – but it has since been confirmed by Intel that this was a mistranslation . The idea that Intel ’ s first discrete graphics card could seriously undercut Nvidia and AMD ’ s flagship cards by hundreds of dollars , yet still provide high-end performance with HBM ( High-Bandwidth Memory ) was certainly thrilling , as it could completely disrupt the GPU market – however Intel was quick to temper expectations by revealing that this was a mistranslation of the interview – which was originally conducted in Russian with the PRO Hi-Tech YouTube channel , in a video that has since been taken down . While the translation suggested that Intel was looking to release an Intel Xe graphics card at $ 200 , what Koduri was actually saying is that mainstream cards in general start at $ 200 . The idea of a flagship-killing Intel Xe graphics card at that price seemed too good to be true – and so it proved . The cost of HBM alone would make it pretty much impossible to release a GPU at that price . In a statement , Intel clarified Koduri ’ s remarks : “ Raja was making the point that not all users will buy a $ 500- $ 600 graphics card , and that Intel strategy revolves around going for the full stack that ranges from Client to the Data Center . The $ 200 reference in the interview was an example of general entry pricing for Client dGPUs – and not a confirmation of Intel dGPU pricing . ” So , we ’ re not going to be seeing an Intel Xe GPU for $ 200 any time soon . However , that might not rule it out completely . According to the translation Intel provided , Koduri suggests that Intel wants to release competitive GPUs for all budgets in “ 2-3 years ” , so it ’ s likely we ’ ll see an Intel GPU that ’ s aimed at the budget market in the future . Whether or not it will be quite as cheap as $ 200 remains to be seen… Via NotebookCheck

Update : Intel has reached out and clarified , stating that it would target the mainstream market , which would start at the $ 200 ( £165 , AU $ 295 ) level , but would also extend to the $ 500 ( £400 , AU $ 700 ) - $ 600 ( £530 , AU $ 850 ) range as well , in order to provide a full range of graphics cards . It also stated that it could take between 2-3 years to provide the full product stack . Original story continued below . So , we 've known for a while that Intel graphics cards are going to be a thing , but now we have an idea of what sector of the market they 'll occupy . In an interview with Russian YouTube channel Pro Hi-Tech , Intel chief architect and senior vice president of architecture , Raja Koduri reportedly said that Intel Xe graphics cards will initially target the `` $ 200 price , then the same architecture but with the higher amount of HBM memory for data centers '' , according to a translation from Reddit user Taryakun . That converts to around £165 / AU $ 295 for the graphics cards . It 's important to note right out of the gate that this is an unverified translation , so we 'd take it with a grain of salt . However , it would make a lot of sense for Intel to tackle the entry-level market with its initial Intel Xe graphics cards , as that 's where the money is . However , the translation does also suggest that these graphics cards would be using HBM memory . This is a bit hard to be believed , as this variation of VRAM is traditionally much more expensive than the GDDR6 found in both Nvidia Turing and AMD Navi graphics cards . Over the last few weeks , Intel Xe graphics cards leaks and rumors have been everywhere , and this apparently official word from the Intel 's graphics card lead only adds fuel to the fire . We previously spotted a rumor that Intel 's Xe graphics cards would have 128 execution units ( EUs ) at the entry level , which is just twice what the integrated graphics in the new Ice Lake processors feature . We could definitely see a graphics card with that level of processing slotted in at that $ 200 / £165 / AU $ 295 price point . A little earlier , though , we saw a rumor that Intel graphics cards would have ray tracing built in . Now , there has been some speculation that ray tracing would be essentially required in a few years time , but we find it hard to believe that ray tracing support could be baked into a graphics card of that price in the near future . Either way , seeing Intel take on AMD in Team Red 's traditional territory would be almost poetic , seeing how Intel is falling behind when it comes to processor sales . Until we see the cards in the flesh , hopefully around 2020 when Team Blue initially said it would release its first discrete graphics cards .
AMD ’ s Ryzen 3000 series processors , spearheaded by the Ryzen 7 3700X , have led what looks like an unprecedented assault on Intel ’ s CPUs , at least going by the figures from one component retailer . The latest stats from German retailer Mindfactory ( as highlighted on Reddit ) for the month of July show that AMD sold an incredible 79 % of all processor units , compared to 21 % for Intel . AMD ’ s top-selling chip was the Ryzen 7 3700X , and get this : sales of that one single processor weren ’ t far off equaling the sales of Intel ’ s entire CPU range ( at around the 80 % mark of what Intel flogged ) . In June , AMD ’ s overall market share was 68 % at Mindfactory , so the increase to 79 % represents a big jump , and the highest proportion of sales achieved by the company this year by a long way . To put this in a plainer fashion , for every single processor sold by Intel , AMD sold four . Ryzen 3rd-gen offerings have seemingly sold up a storm in the first couple weeks on shelves , and then slowed down , although that slippage is likely due to stock shortages rather than falling demand ( the new flagship Ryzen 9 3900X chip is vanishingly thin on the ground , for example , and is therefore being flogged for extortionate prices on eBay in predictable fashion ) . Of course , we need to highlight the usual caveats : this is just a single set of figures from one online retailer , and as such hardly representative of the overall CPU industry . Indeed , this represents a focus on PC enthusiast and consumer sales – which is still very telling – although Intel shifts plenty of chips elsewhere in the likes of the business and laptop market . Plus the burst of momentum we are seeing here , built around a launch , obviously isn ’ t likely to be sustainable for long , and don ’ t forget Intel will reply – AMD ’ s rival has reportedly got some interesting answers up its sleeve ( a 10-core Comet Lake CPU could beat out AMD ’ s Ryzen 9 3900X , or so the rumor mill reckons ) . All that said , we can throw in as many caveats as we like , but the plain truth ( at least from this source ) is that AMD ’ s doing better than ever , and grabbing a truly startling proportion of CPU market share – even with apparent stock issues providing some headwind . Another illuminating aspect here is that Ryzen 3rd-gen has made more of an impact than either of its preceding generations , and that shows AMD is definitely heading in the right direction ( if you needed any further indication aside from the glowing reviews for Ryzen 3000 , including our own ) . Other feedback from Asia shows that AMD is making strong progress here , in South Korea and Japan , and according to one report , in the latter case , AMD has driven up to a market share of 47 % and almost parity with Intel . Not too shabby when you consider that back at the start of 2018 , AMD ’ s share was just 18 % in Japan . Whichever way you dice this , AMD is busy making massive strides , buoyed strongly by Ryzen 3000 chips , and Intel needs a suitably emphatic response to this , otherwise things will start to slide in more than just the PC enthusiast market . The aforementioned report on Japan showed AMD growth even in prebuilt PCs and laptops , where the firm now holds 14.7 % of territory ( which doesn ’ t sound like a lot , but it ’ s more than treble the market share of 3.9 % the company held back at the beginning of 2018 ) .

Back at Computex 2019 , Intel gave us our first real look at Ice Lake . A platform designed for the next generation of mobile computing , it would use AI to boost productivity . And , finally Intel has detailed exactly what to expect from Ice Lake . Now , these processors are mobile chips , so you wo n't be able to buy them and slot them into your desktop – Ice Lake is n't Intel 's answer to AMD Ryzen 3000 , that will likely come with Comet Lake . Instead , these processors serve as the first step in Intel 's future-looking Project Athena . Now , these 10th-generation mobile processors will come in U- and Y-series flavors , which for the uninitiated are for Ultrabooks and fanless laptops , respectively , and will , of course , feature the latest connectivity options . That means Wi-Fi 6 ( formerly known as 802.11ax ) and Thunderbolt 3 will be supported natively – the latter with up to four USB-C ports . What may be more important , however , is the inclusion of Intel Gen11 graphics . These still wo n't likely make for the best gaming laptops by themselves , but should feature more than enough power to get through a round of Fortnite on your lunch break – something we definitely aim to test when laptops bearing Ice Lake processors make it to market . Ice Lake processors are also smart , which might be the most interesting thing here . These processors will leverage the power of artificial intelligence to boost performance when you need it , or slow things down when idling in order to reserve battery power . These processors will use Deep Learning to adapt to your workloads to make sure they 're delivering the most performance and the most efficiency when needed . There are plenty of new processors that will be heading to a laptop near you over the next few months . There are a ton of high-performance U-series chips that will be featured in upcoming Ultrabooks , alongside some Y-Series chips that will be behind the thinnest and lightest products . We went ahead and listed all of the new processors down below , along with the specs you can expect from each of them . One thing to note is that many of these processors come with Intel Iris Plus graphics , which was previously reserved for more premium SKUs . One thing we have to note is that Intel is measuring its graphics cores as `` EUs '' , or Execution Cores . In the Intel Core i7-1068G7 – the most powerful Ice Lake processor – you 'll be getting 64 Execution Units . These are functionally similar to Nvidia 's CUDA cores , or AMD 's Stream Processors , in that the more you have the faster the GPU will be able to handle complex graphics workloads . Obviously , graphics cards have thousands of these streaming processors these days , but those also cost a significant amount of cash , and you ca n't exactly slot one into an Ultrabook . We do n't have a full list of laptops packing Ice Lake processors yet , but we 're sure we can expect some impressive graphics performance out of this generation – at least compared to other integrated graphics solutions . Perhaps we can expect Intel 's Xe graphics cards to follow in Gen11 's footsteps . Ice Lake U-Series processors : Ice Lake Y-Series processors : You 'll notice in the above spec lists that this is the first time Intel 's Y Series of fanless processors has gone quad-core . Sure , it 's on i5 processors and above , but do n't you wish the 2019 MacBook Air came out just a little later now ?

It 's no secret that Intel has been playing catch-up with AMD over the last few months as Team Red pulled ahead with Ryzen 3rd Generation – Team Blue has itself admitted this . But , some leaked benchmarks of Intel 's next high-end desktop ( HEDT ) platform suggest it will fall behind AMD 's mainstream platform . This is all according to a leaked GeekBench 4 entry spotted by the folks over at Wccftech . In these results , the Intel Core i9-10920X scores a multi-core result of 44,046 , compared to the 44,160 scored by the Ryzen 9 3900X in our review . If this leaked benchmark reflects reality , it wo n't look too good for Intel when Cascade Lake-X launches later this year . Now , it 's important to note that HEDT and mainstream processors are n't directly comparable , as they target different segments of the market . However , because HEDT chips are targeting high processor ( CPU ) performance for creatives and professionals , they 're expected to crush mainstream silicon into the dirt – and the prices reflect that . For instance , the last-generation Intel Core i9-9920X retails for $ 1,189 ( £1,049 , AU $ 1,799 ) . So , if its successor is around the same price , which we do n't know for sure , it should be able to beat AMD 's mainstream flagship that 's about half the price at $ 499 ( £531 , AU $ 809 ) . It 's true that the Ryzen 9 3900X is facing increased prices right now , but they 've not increased that much . It is also true that this leaked GeekBench 4 result is better than an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2920X , but that processor is a year old , and new Threadripper chips are right around the corner . Either way , these leaks may not represent reality , and we wo n't know the details of what Intel 's Cascade Lake-X can do until Team Blue reveals its next desktop processors . Until then , all we can do is look at these leaks and try to guess what will happen next . At the very least , the PC components space is alive with competition once more .
If you ’ ve been a PC gamer for as long as we have , there ’ s a very high chance that you ’ ll have at some point played on a PC that ’ s powered by one of Intel ’ s processors . For a long time Intel was the king of gaming processors , and while AMD has been putting up a brilliant fight recently , as you can see from our list of the best processors of 2019 , Intel ’ s latest processors dominate the list . With PC games becoming ever more graphic- and processor-intensive , while PC gamers require more from their gaming rigs , it ’ s meant that companies like Intel have had to rise to the challenge to keep on producing hardware that keeps up with our demands . We sat down with Steve Shakespeare , EMEA Enterprise Solutions Director at Intel , to chat about Intel ’ s involvement in PC gaming , and what challenges – and rewards – there are when you build platforms for gamers and enthusiasts . One of the first things we wanted to chat about with Shakespeare was how , in the last 12 months , the processor wars between Intel and its rival AMD have been renewed , with a re-invigorated AMD winning over a lot of PC gamers and enthusiasts with its well-received Ryzen line of processors , which includes the brilliant 16-core Threadripper 1950X . Not to be outdone , Intel fought back with some excellent processors of its own , including the Intel Core i7-8700K and the beastly 18-core Intel Core i9-7980XE . Since then , we ’ ve seen a steady stream of excellent processors coming out of both camps . Intel 's latest high-end processor , the Intel Core i9-9900K , is an octa-core beast , and one of the best processors money can buy for PC gamers who are serious about building the ultimate gaming rig . `` There ’ s an insatiable desire for computing power from this gaming audience . '' It 's certainly an exciting time for processors , and according to Shakespeare , Intel shares that enthusiasm . “ I think the excitement is back and there is so much exciting stuff going on in the PC category right now . I think we ’ ve all seen the double-digit growth in the overall gaming enthusiast category . From our perspective we ’ re thrilled about that , we invest very heavily to get behind the products , behind the whole CPU family , and it feel like that is enabling the excitement that we ’ re seeing in the market . ” The increased expectations of what gamers expect their gaming PCs should be able to achieve has also appeared to invigorate Intel . “ We ’ re seeing increased demand for premium processors because there ’ s an insatiable desire for computing power from this gaming audience . It amazes me what people want to do , right ? Not only do they want to play a great game , which in and of itself is intensive on the CPU , intensive on graphics as well , but they also maybe want to record that , they want to stream it onto Twitch , they want to have a real-time conversation with people , and watching other stuff at the same time . It just amazes me . ” While there is often a lot of doom and gloom when it comes to the state of the desktop PC market , it appears that PC gamers are responsible for an increase in desktop and laptop sales . “ We see gaming being a big growth-engine in the market , for desktops and notebooks . We ’ re seeing gaming grow in both areas . Interestingly , gaming is growing faster on notebooks , but it ’ s from a smaller base . ” With mobile processors for laptops becoming ever more powerful , alongside thinner dedicated graphics cards which can fit inside thin and light notebooks , gaming laptops are becoming ever more viable . Just look at our list of the best gaming laptops , for example . “ There are some really great desktops that give you that infinite flexibility that some people want , but you also see some really super high-performance notebooks , ” Shakespeare explains , and with Intel ’ s Coffee Lake S CPUs , that innovation for gamers and enthusiasts seems to be only improving . “ Coffee Lake S , which is the 8th generation desktop part… [ has ] up to 40 % stronger performance , generation on generation . So versus that 7th generation CPU that is already really good for gaming , as [ we ’ ve ] put 40 % headroom on it . We ’ re going to put up to six cores in the platform , and then when you marry that with a high-performance graphics card you ’ re going to get phenomenally powerful systems that are going to be able to play games at super-high settings , and offer that really immersive experience that gamers want . ” The six-core Coffee Lake processors , such as the Intel Core i7-8700K aren ’ t just making games even better , they are also allowing people to live stream while gaming , as well as creating and editing in-game footage on the fly . This sort of high-level multitasking is at the forefront of what Intel is doing , according to Shakespeare , and it ’ s that demand which is helping drive high-end processors . “ As I mentioned , the up to six cores in the 8th generation Coffee Lake desktop part , for example , gives you that many more cores , so you have lots of parallel processes running , and they ’ re all high-performance cores ... that enables you to do lots of things . So , you might have some of the cores playing the game , some of the cores enabling your Twitch streaming , some of the cores maybe recording , some of the cores maybe doing other tasks , so that gives you that real performance . ” Of course , there are also the 16 and 18-core processors Intel released last year which offer up even more impressive multitasking performance . While these Core i9 beasts are aimed at enthusiasts who need the very cutting edge technology and performance , Intel is careful to make sure it has impressively-performing CPUs aimed at gamers and content creators no matter what their budgets . “ What we have is a ladder , and you can work your way up , ” explains Shakespeare . “ So , whether you want a Core i3 or a Core i5 or a Core i7 or a Core i9 , they ’ re all there . [ We ’ ve got ] 8th gen obviously ... on desktops… [ as well as ] 8th gen on the H-series mobile parts , giving you up to 40 % improvement on gaming on laptops . Then we ’ ve also got i9 [ on laptops ] as well . ” Intel having a wide range of cutting edge CPUs for all manner of budgets isn ’ t a surprise , and , as Shakespeare says , “ we ’ re responding to what the market ’ s demanding , and you know we also absolutely believe we ’ ve got the leadership technology at all the levels ” . `` We ’ re really excited about virtual reality and how that ’ s extending the experiences that people can have with gaming . ” Intel is also particularly proud of its Core i9 offerings . “ That 18-core Core i9 product , that is our first teraflop PC , can you imagine that ? You remember when teraflop computing was super-computing that occupied a room , that kind of controlled a city ? Well , now you can get it on your desktop and run that . So , I think that ’ s really fascinating . ” These high-end CPUs aren ’ t just allowing PC gamers to multitask , they also offer new experiences in Virtual Reality as well . “ We ’ re really excited about virtual reality and how that ’ s extending the experiences that people can have with gaming , ” Shakespeare explains . “ And , what ’ s really exciting for esports is that we are starting to see virtual reality esports games come in , and the enthusiasm for that is fantastic . So , one of the things that we are doing with our processors is making sure that we can enable the best virtual reality gaming experience as well . ” So , how vital is the processor to virtual reality ? For Shakespeare and Intel , it is an essential part of the puzzle . “ A lot of people say ‘ Hey virtual reality , isn ’ t that a graphics card thing ? Don ’ t you just need a good graphics card for that ? ’ The answer is you need both ; you need a great graphics card and you need a great CPU . And here ’ s the reason why : in order to do virtual reality well , there ’ s a whole bunch of artificial intelligence that has to take place , there ’ s a whole bunch of logic that has to operate to support the game . So , the graphic card does the rendering , the CPU does the AI , as well as the physics . ” That ’ s the key to immersion . When in a virtual reality world , you want it to behave realistically . Shakespeare has an example . “ When I shoot that bullet and it hits that wall , what ’ s going the happen ? Well , it ’ s going to make a hole , and some bits are going to fly in the air somewhere , right ? So , the CPU works out what ’ s going to happen mathematically , then the graphics card presents that on the screen . If you get that in balance you get the best experience for your platform . ” One of the biggest drivers of the PC gaming renaissance has been the growing popularity of esports , where players and teams play PC games competitively to a huge – and expanding – audience . It ’ s also something that Intel has been very involved with . “ So , esports has got this massive following , about 385 million people worldwide are following esports , and for Intel this is a really important endeavour . We work with the electronic sport league , with the ESL , and we have the Intel Extreme Masters competition . So , we ’ re investing really heavily in esports to make sure that we understand what that audience needs , and we can bring them the best computing platforms to deliver those games. “ For Shakespeare , it was attending the Intel Extreme Masters final in Poland that really opened his eyes to the excitement of esports . “ I was at the final , and 170,000 people turn up at a stadium for a weekend to watch this . And you suddenly appreciate it . You say , ‘ Wow , I get it ’ . This is like a sporting event , it ’ s like going to see a soccer match or a rugby match . People are in the audience , they ’ re supporting their team , they ’ re cheering excitedly , and I love that . ” `` We ’ re investing really heavily in esports to make sure that we understand what that audience needs . '' Shakespeare also has a vision for the future of esports , and it ’ s one Intel shares . “ I think the next level that we ’ re now seeing is around VR . And , we want to help enable that . Not only do you have powerful hardware to play VR games on , which is what we ’ re doing with our Intel products , you also need to be able to broadcast that so the audience can see it . So , they ’ re in a stadium but also online . ” So , if you thought broadcasting normal games while also playing them was stressful enough for your hardware , playing and broadcasting in virtual reality will be even more demanding . “ I think at IEM , for example , there was something like 45 million streaming viewers of the event . That ’ s just monumental , and a worldwide audience . But , if you think about it , to make that interesting to the viewers , you ’ ve got to be able to broadcast what ’ s going on . So , if you ’ re in a VR game , at the same time your PC has got to take that information , package it all up and then it ’ s got to be able to stream it out onto Twitch . So again , you need a strong platform to do that . So , that ’ s kind of what we ’ re trying to support . ” So , with a steady stream of amazing games , esports and virtual reality , it ’ s never been a more exciting time to be a PC gamer , and Intel seems enthused as well , enjoying the challenges posed by gamers who expect ever more from their gaming rigs . “ Innovation is alive and well , not just with gaming enthusiasts , it ’ s this whole new industry and this whole new sporting industry with esports that ’ s coming to life . I love it when I see so many people excited about it . ” Welcome to TechRadar 's PC Gaming Week 2019 .

Intel 's Project Athena is an innovation program created by the chipmaker to aid laptop makers build the revolutionary laptops of the future . Announced at CES 2019 , Project Athena sees Intel working with some of the biggest names in the laptop industry – including Acer , Asus , Dell , Google , HP , Lenovo , Microsoft and Samsung – to craft the next generation of laptops that are thinner , lighter and more powerful , as well as have lightning fast connectivity , a system that wakes from sleep in a flash and battery life that will last all day . If that sounds like a mythical invention to you , just take a look at the HP Elite Dragonfly , a Project Athena-certified 2-in-1 laptop that ’ s under 1kg in weight and has a battery life that lasts more than 24 hours on a single charge . It 's somewhat akin to what Intel and laptop manufacturers did with Ultrabooks some years back . By coming up with a list of minimum specifications that laptops would have to meet to be known as Ultrabooks , consumers know they are getting the very latest – and greatest – hardware . With Project Athena laptops , Intel and its partners are seeking to make devices that can handle the demands of modern-day computing . It ’ s a very big deal , and we at TechRadar , for one , can not wait to see the kind of laptops that this grand program will result in . Here are the news and rumors we 've gathered together , and everything else we know so far about Intel 's Project Athena . Intel Project Athena is a laptop design initiative that sees Intel work even more closely with a number of laptop manufacturers to help reinvent the future of laptops . Many people also consider Project Athena as Intel 's way of battling the growth of Windows 10 on ARM devices , and laptops running on Qualcomm Snapdragon hardware . These devices offer always-on connections and remarkably long battery life , but do n't use Intel hardware . While Windows 10 on ARM devices have excelled at battery life , start-up times and always-on connectivity thanks to built-in 4G LTE support , they have so far been unsuccessful in offer decent performance that ’ s comparable to Intel-powered laptops . Project Athena will see Intel offer guidance to equipment and PC component manufacturers to create future laptops that are smarter , faster ( thanks to 5G ) and more power efficient – which will likely mean much longer battery life . Intel has also revealed at the Project Athena Ecosystem Symposium event in Taipei , Taiwan that it will open three global Project Athena Open Labs facilities – two in Taipei and Shanghai , one in Folsom , California – in order to work with manufacturers and test their laptops to ensure they meet Project Athena 's specifications . These labs started operating in June 2019 . Josh Newman , Intel vice president and general manager of PC Innovation Segments , Client Computing Group , said that `` Project Athena Open Labs are a critical step in enabling more extensive , day-to-day collaboration with the components ecosystem to continuously raise the bar for innovation across the platform . '' Intel has also revealed how Project Athena `` creates a path forward to accelerate laptop innovation '' through : Intel has implied that initial Project Athena laptops could release as early as the second half of 2019 . However , if that 's the case , then we would n't expect to see any Project Athena-certified laptops until very late this year . Since the Project Athena Open Labs didn ’ t launch until June , the early Project Athena laptops that we could see in 2019 will likely be Intel-made reference devices that will offer consumers and manufacturers a taste of what Project Athena laptops will be capable of . According to Intel , `` the next wave of Project Athena designs '' will come in `` 2020 and beyond , '' so expect to see Project Athena laptops from manufacturers , like Asus and Acer , next year . Currently , we do n't have any information on what sort of prices Project Athena laptops will sell for . However , that ’ s never stopped us from making a few educated guesses before . Considering the target spec and features of Project Athena laptops ( which we 'll get to in a moment ) , it 's possible that these are going to be high-priced laptops . Intel 's Ultrabook initiative , which was similar to Project Athena in the fact that it saw Intel working with laptop makers to develop laptops that met clear design and specification criteria , resulted in high-end machines with premium price tags . It 's not too much of a stretch , therefore , to think that Project Athena laptops will be pitched at the high-end in terms of hardware and price . If we do see Intel-made Project Athena laptops this year , with the third-party Athena laptops following in 2020 , then that ’ s another hint that the first wave of Project Athena laptops will be quite pricey . However , when third-party Athena laptops launch , prices could potentially become more affordable , as there will be more competition between the companies . It seems likely that Project Athena laptops will be pitched as alternatives to Windows on ARM laptops , like the HP Envy x2 . Those ARM laptops have prices around $ 1,000/£1,000/AU $ 1,500 , so it won ’ t be surprising if Project Athena laptops will tout that price point as well . However , before you get too dismayed about being unable to afford an Intel Project Athena laptop , there are some clues that suggest we may see more affordable Athena-certified laptops as well . For a start , Intel has talked about how Project Athena will cover a range of laptop types . It 's also been announced that some Athena laptops will run Windows 10 and Chrome OS . Coupled with the fact that Google is one of the Project Athena partners , it looks like we 'll be getting Project Athena Chromebooks . Since Chromebooks are generation a lot cheaper than traditional laptops , they may provide a cheaper way to partake in some of that Project Athena goodness . Intel has recently released the specifications for Project Athena , and it is comprised of 15 responsiveness metrics and 3 battery life metrics . All 23 of these metrics are aimed at creating the next generation of laptops it has envisioned . Based on these specifications , Intel will determine whether each laptop model is up to snuff . When it does , it gets Intel ’ s “ Engineered for mobile performance ” seal of approval , which essentially tells consumers that it ’ s a Project Athena certified device . To release a laptop as part of Project Athena , manufacturers will have to meet certain features and specifications . While we haven ’ t gotten our hands on a definitive list just yet , here are the features we know will be part of Project Athena . 5G connectivity : One of the chief features of Project Athena will be 5G connectivity . This means that every Project Athena laptop will come with the capability to connect to 5G cellular networks ( via a SIM card ) . 5G will offer speeds far in excess of 4G , and 5G-equipped laptops will allow access to the internet without needing to connect to Wi-Fi . This is not only more convenient – as you 'll be able to check your emails and browse the web from pretty much anywhere that has 5G network coverages – but also more secure , as you won ’ t have to rely on open Wi-Fi networks . The speed boosts promised by 5G could also allow us to use our Athena laptops in exciting new ways like streaming 4K content or playing games on services such as Nvidia GeForce Now and Google Stadia , which utilize remote PCs to power games that are streamed to your device . Longer battery life : Improving the battery life on laptops has been a constant struggle for manufacturers . With laptops getting thinner than ever , the space to add batteries is shrinking as well . With laptops getting more powerful – and more power-hungry – laptop makers have to carefully balance maximizing battery life without throttling performance . Project Athena intends to drastically improve battery life of laptops , with times between charges of around 9 hours , a lot longer than many modern Intel-based laptops . True , Snapdragon-based laptops have seen battery life figures of beyond 24 hours , which makes the 9 hours aim a bit less impressive . It 's worth noting , however , that Snapdragon-based laptops have considerably poorer performance . If Project Athena results in laptops that perform well and have long battery life , then Intel could be on to a winner . Instant-on : No one likes waiting around for our laptops and PCs boot up Windows . Smartphones and tablets have spoiled us when it comes to devices that power up almost instantly . So , Project Athena is aiming to bring that to Windows-based laptops and Chromebooks with Intel hardware inside . Again , Windows on ARM devices already accomplish this , and they also remain connected even in sleep mode . Emails continue to be downloaded , for example , so when you open up the laptop , your emails are already there , waiting for you . We hope – and expect – for Project Athena to offer similar functionality . Intel hardware : We also expect Intel to set minimum hardware specifications , such as including SSD storage and support for Wi-Fi 6 , the latest wireless networking technology . By setting these minimum specifications , Project Athena laptops will guarantee some of the latest and most cutting-edge technology available .

Update : A source with knowledge of the situation has been in contact to assure us that Intel has not been ditched by Microsoft when it comes to Surface products . It looks like we could see devices with a range of CPUs from different manufacturers . It ’ s looking ever more likely that Microsoft is ditching Intel for AMD when it comes to the processor powering its upcoming Surface Laptop 3 , with new benchmarks apparently showing Microsoft ’ s upcoming laptop running on AMD hardware – potentially a quad-core AMD processor with Radeon Vega integrated graphics . This follows a number of rumors that have indicated that Microsoft could be going with AMD hardware for the Surface Laptop 3 , rather than Intel – which it ’ s usually used in its Surface devices . A recent rumor even suggested that the Surface Laptop 3 could come with an 8-core AMD Ryzen processor . While Intel has been Microsoft ’ s processor manufacturer of choice for its Surface devices , Windows Latest has found yet more evidence that it could be switching to AMD , with leaked benchmark results apparently showing a Microsoft device running on an AMD Ryzen 5 3550U mobile processor . Another benchmark , spotted on Reddit , shows a device by the same name as the other leak - ‘ OEMMO OEMMO Product Name DV ’ – which will run an AMD Ryzen 5 Microsoft Surface Edition processor . So , what can we glean from these recent rumors ? Well , it looks increasingly likely that Microsoft is going with AMD over Intel for the Surface Laptop 3 , which is a big win for AMD and a big blow for Intel . It also means we ’ re likely to see a number of different Surface Laptop 3 configurations , including one with a quad-core AMD processor , and a more expensive one with a hexa-core AMD processor as well . With Microsoft ’ s upcoming October event happening on October 2 , we shouldn ’ t have to wait too long to find out if rumors of an AMD-powered Surface Laptop 3 are correct .

A new roadmap suggests that Intel ’ s Eagle Stream platform and Sapphire Rapids processors are still right on schedule . Aspeed , leading provider of Baseboard Management Controllers ( BMCs ) , recently launched the AST2600 , the first 28nm BMC chip intended for the next generation servers . And , with the AST2600 announcement came the chip ’ s roadmap , which made an appearance on serial hardware leaker Komachi_Ensaka ’ s Twitter feed . While that ’ s excellent news in its own right , what caught our attention here is this roadmap itself . Bearing the Aspeed logo , it clearly shows that Intel ’ s Eagle Stream Platform is expected for an early 2021 launch . As Tom ’ s Hardware reports , this is promising news considering Intel has already delayed the release of its Ice Lake-SP processors . This roadmap corroborates a leaked Huawei roadmap , also revealed by Tom ’ s Hardware earlier in May . This shows that Intel is planning on launching Sapphire Rapids in 2021 and Granite Rapids ( 7nm ) in 2022 . This older roadmap also shows that Sapphire Rapids will support DDR5 , PCIe 5.0 and CXL . Sapphire Rapids , the 10nm microarchitecture that ’ s intended to succeed Ice Lake , was first announced in a May 2019 Intel Investor Meeting . And , if you don ’ t know already , Eagle Stream , slated to succeed 2020 ’ s Whitley platform , will serve as the data center platform for these chips as well as the Granite Rapids chips that will follow them . Of course , Intel hasn ’ t confirmed any of this . Nor has the company formally announced the Eagle Stream platform . However , if both roadmaps were to be believed and nothing changes drastically from now until 2021 , then Intel is right on schedule and it is full steam ahead for the microarchitectures and their processors .

It 's no secret that AMD is experiencing a surge in both popularity and sales , but we 've just seen some analysis that really puts AMD 's recent victories into perspective . Recently through the German retailer Mindfactory , both the AMD Ryzen 7 3700X and AMD Ryzen 5 3600 have outsold Intel 's entire product range – and this is n't exactly a new occurrence . That alone would be enough to assert AMD 's dominance , but Reddit user ingebor gathered up a whole bunch of sales data from Mindfactory that illustrates just how far AMD has come in the last decade . According to this data , AMD has been beating Intel in the amount of processors sold since the tail end of 2018 , but that did n't exactly result in AMD collecting more cash . This is probably because Intel charges much more for its processors on average . Reddit user ingebor included a graph recording the average selling price for each processor , and Intel has been much higher for years now . So , even if AMD sells more processors , that does n't result in more revenue . Until recently , that is . According to the revenue graph , AMD has recently experienced a massive spike in revenue ( and in the average selling price of its processors ) . The graph is n't labeled by month , but it looks like this spike occurred right around when AMD launched its Ryzen 3rd Generation lineup , spearheaded by the Ryzen 9 3900X . From the way things are looking now , it does n't look like Intel will be taking back its leader position in the desktop CPU market , at least until Team Blue puts out its 10th gen desktop lineup . We 've seen some rumors that it would be putting out some 10th-gen Cascade Lake-X processors , but it 's unlikely that HEDT chips like that will regain Intel 's market dominance . AMD launched its first generation of Ryzen processors in early 2017 , and that 's right when we see the first spike of that red line on all three graphs . Before that , AMD had relied on its struggling Bulldozer CPU architecture , which allowed Intel to dominate the desktop CPU market with little to no competition . AMD Ryzen could have easily been a fluke , but Intel kept releasing more and more optimizations of Skylake , rather than innovating , which helped AMD 's Zen architecture take over . With each AMD Ryzen release , we see AMD gaining market share – with another spike in 2018 with Ryzen 2nd generation , and than an absolutely meteoric rise this year with AMD Ryzen 3rd generation . Intel will be putting out a new Coffee Lake Refresh chip with the Intel Core i9-9900KS , and while it will probably sell – 5.0GHz on all cores means it will be a speedy little piece of silicon – but we really do n't think it will be enough to reverse the trend . However , if Intel is able to bring some of the efficiency and AI features in Ice Lake to the desktop audience without significantly raising the price of its silicon , we might see Team Blue start to claw its way back to dominance . And , honestly , we hope something actually happens . It 's nice to see AMD give Intel some long-awaited competition , but the last thing we want to see is AMD fall into complacency like Intel did . When the PC components marketplace is competitive , everyone wins , so we want nothing more than for Intel to put out some killer processors . Now all we have to do is sit and wait to see what the 10th generation has in store . Via Tom 's Hardware
We ’ ve been hearing quite a lot about the Ryzen 5 3500X lately , AMD ’ s rumored budget CPU which is supposedly incoming ( alongside the Ryzen 5 3500 ) , and now some benchmarks have been spilled showing that it outdoes the Core i5-9400F ( with some illuminating non-comparative game benchmarking having been done , too ) . This comes from a Chinese tech site ( as spotted by Wccftech ) which has apparently got hold of the Ryzen 5 3500X before anyone else and given the processor the full unboxing treatment in a video , alongside the aforementioned benchmarking . As with any such pre-release leak , we have to chuck the usual salt around , but reportedly the 3500X was tested running in an MSI B450M Mortar Max motherboard paired with a GTX 1660 ( 6GB ) graphics card ( with the PC having 16GB of DDR4 system RAM ) . Various games were apparently tested at 1080p resolution , including Assassin ’ s Creed Odyssey where the 3500X managed to record an average of 65 fps or frames per second ( and a minimum of 27 fps ) . Shadow of the Tomb Raider witnessed a 77 fps average , with PUBG hitting 80 fps on average . In World War Z the processor managed an average 126 fps ( with a minimum 109 fps ) , and League of Legends hit an average of 180 fps . As mentioned , all this was with a GTX 1660 GPU . As we ’ ve been hearing , these allegedly incoming budget Ryzen processors are designed to take on Intel ’ s popular Core i5 9400F , and the Chinese site also did some comparative benchmarking with the latter . In CPU-Z , the Ryzen 5 3500X achieved a single-core result of 476.3 compared to the Core i5 9400F ’ s score of 451.4 . In multi-threaded , the result was 2,774.9 for AMD versus 2,568.2 for Intel ( meaning the 3500X is about 5 % and 8 % faster , respectively ) . Remember we ’ ve already seen some leaked presentation slides of game benchmarks ( again with a GTX 1660 ) that show performance levels are pretty even between these AMD and Intel chips . The Ryzen 3rd-gen chip was also victorious in some productivity benchmarking , again reportedly to the tune of around 5 % – so the 3500X looks like a solid performance bump over the 9400F . Of course , exactly how this rumored chip ( and the vanilla 3500 ) will stack up against that rival Intel CPU very much depends on where AMD pitches the price . The Core i5-9400F – which is a spin on the Core i5-9400 that ditches the integrated graphics to lower the price – can be had for about $ 140 ( around £112 , AU $ 206 ) these days . And as we ’ ve previously theorized , the 3500X might cost a little more than that , perhaps hitting $ 150 ( around £120 , AU $ 221 ) , although the Ryzen 5 3500 will likely undercut Intel ’ s price tag . The plain Ryzen 5 3500 won ’ t be quite as quick as the 3500X , of course . While it allegedly runs with essentially the same specs – six-cores , six-threads , clocked at 3.6GHz with boost to 4.1GHz – it only has half the cache ( 16MB rather than 32MB ) , which will slow it down a bit in comparison . Wccftech believes the Ryzen 5 3500X is about to go on sale ( presumably in Asia ? ) , but naturally that remains to be seen . We still haven ’ t had these budget Ryzen chips officially confirmed , yet .

As we ’ re gearing up for the launch of the Intel Core i9-9900KS ­– with some motherboard manufacturers already releasing motherboard firmware ­to support the new processor – new documentations surface to suggest that the more powerful iteration of Intel Core i9-9900K could potentially hit the streets with a 127W TDP ( thermal design power ) . Sharp-eyed Redditor Urotho noticed that Asus has updated the processor support list for its ROG Maximus XI Code gaming motherboard , listing the Core i9-9900KS with a 127W TDP . Of course , this specification has not been confirmed by Intel . Additionally , it looks like Asus has since taken the Core i9-9900KS off the motherboard ’ s CPU support list , perhaps until the chip hits the streets in October . However , Tom ’ s Hardware also pointed out that Russian retailer DNS Shop corroborates this information on its Core i9-9900KS landing page . We already know that the forthcoming CPU will boast a 4GHz base clock and a 5.0GHz boost clock across all cores , over i9-9900K ’ s 3.6GHz and 5.0GHz base and boost clocks . But , other than that , there ’ s not much difference in their specs , as the Core i9-9900KS is reported to have the same number of cores and threads , among other things . If the rumor mill is right , however , the Core i9-9900KS will boast the highest TDP rating on an Intel mainstream desktop processor . Its 127W TDP , which is 33.68 % higher than that of the i9-9900K ’ s 95W , also means that the chip could potentially offer better performance . On the downside , it will also mean that it will generate more heat and have more power consumption , so it might require a heftier thermal cooling solution . That ’ s without mentioning the fact that not all motherboards on the market will be able to support the Core i9-9900KS . We will , of course , have to wait until its October release to confirm all this . The good news is , it won ’ t be long now until we get our hands on the Intel Core i9-9900KS to see how it performs in real world scenarios . Still no word , however , on how much it will cost .

Intel ’ s 18-core Cascade Lake-X flagship has been spotted again , or at least a benchmark of a processor ( CPU ) which appears to be the incoming Core i9-10980XE has appeared online . As highlighted by @ momomo_us on Twitter , the Geekbench 4 result shows an 18-core ( 36-thread ) , high-end desktop CPU which is presumably the i9-10980XE , with the spec and benchmark results roughly matching up with past leaked details we ’ ve seen ... with one caveat – more on that later . Geekbench 4Intel Core i9-10980XE CPU @ 3.00GHz 18C/36TGenuineIntel Family 6 Model 85 Stepping 7https : //t.co/HNowmORJ7T pic.twitter.com/qpcvdIkh81September 19 , 2019 The CPU is once again ensconced in a Dell Precision 5820 workstation , and the system information in the Geekbench database reports a 2.46GHz base clock speed with Turbo to 3.93GHz . That looks much more peppy than the speeds we witnessed in an alleged 18-core Cascade Lake-X benchmark in August , just a month ago , which was likely an earlier engineering sample ( it had a base clock of 2.19GHz with boost to 3.28GHz , which we noted looked pretty weak at the time ) . This fresh leak also shows that the purported Core i9-10980XE keeps the same cache configuration as the prior 9980XE 18-core flagship . What ’ s also interesting is that Tom ’ s Hardware scrutinized the Geekbench report file and reports that the benchmarking utility registers the Core i9-10980XE with a minimum CPU frequency of 4,108MHz ( 4.1GHz ) and max frequency of 4,779MHz ( nearly 4.8GHz ) . As we saw above , in terms of the actual Geekbench 4 results themselves , the 18-core chip recorded a single-core result of 5,381 with multi-core hitting 51,514 . That ’ s a decent lick faster ( 4 % ) than the predecessor 9980XE which in comparison reached 5,174 in single-core , and as Tom ’ s notes , the system it was in benefited from faster memory , too . And while the single-core result is bang in line with what we saw with the previous leak for the alleged 18-core Cascade Lake-X chip , multi-core is definitely out of whack – this is the caveat we mentioned earlier – and barely any faster than the outgoing 9980XE . That can ’ t be the case for obvious reasons , so it seems there ’ s some kind of error in the benchmark , with no other plausible explanation . Save that all this is faked , of course – which can never be ruled out with these sort of leaks . At any rate , assuming the multi-core result is simply an error of some kind , it ’ s good to get a confirmation of single-core performance levels , and the higher clock speeds that the Core i9-10980XE looks set to run at ( compared to what we saw in that previous 18-core leak ) . One question that remains is how high those clock speeds might be set for the production chip , and how , in turn , that might push the thermal design power ( TDP ) threshold up – because as yet we don ’ t know anything about the power consumption of this CPU . Via Tom ’ s Hardware
AMD continues to forge ahead in the processor market going by a new survey from an analyst firm , although there is a potential dark cloud on the horizon in the form of supply concerns . Barron ’ s highlighted a note from Christopher Rolland , an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group , observing that “ AMD continues to take share at Intel ’ s expense as 7nm rolls out ” , and backing that up with survey data . The Susquehanna survey of more than 2,000 desktop PCs – although that ’ s still a relatively small sample in the bigger picture , of course – found that AMD ’ s CPU market share had expanded to 20 % in the third quarter . That ’ s up considerably from 17 % last year ( and an increase of 1 % compared to the previous quarter ) . A gain of 3 % this year might not sound all that hugely significant , but remember that this effectively represents an uptick of almost a fifth compared to 2018 . Rolland also observed that the new Ryzen 3000 chips will likely continue to push AMD forward in terms of market share , and we ’ d obviously agree – as these chips are evidently selling very well from some sources we ’ ve seen . Furthermore , AMD allegedly has a couple of powerful budget CPUs waiting in the wings to attack Intel at the more affordable end of the market . And of course Intel is being slow to respond to the Ryzen 3000 threat , as next-gen Comet Lake desktop CPU challengers aren ’ t due until 2020 ( hopefully early on next year , but that ’ s speculation at the moment – it could be later , particularly given how well-acquainted Intel has been with slippage in recent times ) . However , the blot on the CPU landscape for AMD is Rolland ’ s final observation that : “ AMD may be currently supply-constrained for its 7nm chips , according to a conversation with a PC industry contact . ” We ’ ve certainly seen evidence that stock levels of certain chips have been struggling to meet demand , such as the flagship Ryzen 9 3900X , which has been thin on the ground since launch , and still continues to be even today . While the industry source may simply be referring to these current stock struggles , which have been obvious enough , remember that this comment comes in the wake of the recent revelation that TSMC is struggling to meet the demands being made of it in terms of 7nm production . TSMC is the big chip-maker which manufactures AMD ’ s 7nm Ryzen 3000 processors ( and Navi graphics cards ) , and it has just tripled its production lead time on 7nm hardware to six months , which as we discussed earlier this week could have potentially negative ramifications for the future supply of AMD CPUs and GPUs . Although any impact of the TSMC situation shouldn ’ t be felt in the shorter-term , as AMD will have secured watertight contracts to ensure 7nm supply in that nearer timeframe . Further out , though , production could become more of a concern , and an observation of supply constraints being picked out by this analyst firm are hardly likely to make anyone feel more comfortable with the situation . Hopefully AMD will be able to maintain its Ryzen 3000 momentum , though , and of course we can hardly judge just yet . One thing ’ s for certain , and that ’ s the fact that the new Ryzen 3000 processors are clearly gobbling up Intel ’ s market share as it stands .
Some fresh online leakage details a pair of allegedly incoming budget Ryzen 3rd-gen processors that AMD has in the wings , the Ryzen 5 3500X and Ryzen 5 3500 ( the latter of which has been previously rumored ) . As Wccftech reports , specs and some pricing details of the chips were uncovered by Extreme IT ( a Thai tech site ) , and they line up with what we ’ ve previously heard . Namely that the Ryzen 5 3500 has six-cores and six-threads ( meaning there ’ s no simultaneous multi-threading here ) , with a base clock speed of 3.6GHz and boost to 4.1GHz , and a TDP of 65W . Interestingly , the Ryzen 5 3500X has an identical spec , the only difference being that it has twice as much cache with 32MB on-board ( obviously the plain 3500 runs with 16MB – which will put a small dent in its performance level in comparison ) . The price for the Ryzen 5 3500 is listed at 4,190 Thai Baht which works out at around $ 137 ( about £109 , AU $ 202 ) , although there is no price given for the 3500X , save for the fact that it will be in the 4,000 Baht range somewhere . These budget processers are aimed at tackling Intel ’ s strong-selling and affordable Core i5-9400F , a version of the Core i5-9400 that ’ s slightly cheaper because it ditches integrated graphics to sell at around $ 150 ( about £120 , AU $ 221 ) – although it ’ s available for $ 140 ( about £112 , AU $ 206 ) at the time of writing . So it makes sense that the Ryzen 5 3500 will be positioned to undercut that price , perhaps at $ 130 or $ 135 ( about £108 , AU $ 199 ) , with the 3500X costing a bit more , and maybe reaching up to $ 150 ( about £120 , AU $ 221 ) . On paper , the purported Ryzen 5 3500 and Core i5-9400F mostly stack up pretty closely spec-wise , with Intel ’ s Coffee Lake Refresh part also offering six-cores and six-threads , and Turbo to 4.1GHz , plus a TDP of 65W . However , there are some telling differences in that Intel ’ s budget Core i5 has a considerably slower base clock of 2.9 GHz , and only 9MB cache compared to the 16MB or 32MB apparently on offer with these new Ryzen chips . And of course the Ryzen 3000 newcomers will benefit from Zen 2 architecture , which boosts instructions per clock ( and therefore overall performance ) considerably compared to AMD ’ s last-gen CPUs , and there are other bonuses which need to be factored in like Ryzen ’ s PCIe 4.0 support . In short , by all accounts Intel has a fight on its hands at the lower-end of the processor market , and to underline that , some presentation slides were spilled on Twitter by BullsLab showing how the 3500X compares with the 9400F in some gaming benchmarks ( run with a GeForce GTX 1660 graphics card ) . Ryzen5 3500X ( $ 159 ? ) vs i5-9400F ( $ 139 ) pic.twitter.com/cjS3hgtQEjSeptember 19 , 2019 Performance between the two chips is pretty even in these game benchmarks ( which include Apex Legends , CS : GO , Dota 2 and PUBG among others ) . Intel has a slight lead in some , AMD in others ( although the Ryzen chip pulls away a bit more in the Counter-Strike benchmark ) . Interesting times indeed , but obviously a lot will depend on exactly where AMD pitches the price of these two new processors , which are surely close on the horizon now ( unless all these slides and leaked info are faked , which seems highly unlikely ) . AMD is already very much killing it of late , at least in the desktop CPU market figures we ’ ve seen recently , with the Ryzen 5 3600 being a particularly strong performer – and now that chip is set to get some serious backup , at least if this rumor pans out .

Intel Ice Lake processors ( CPUs ) have just come out , but we 're already starting to see leaks about Tiger Lake , the next 10 nanometer ( nm ) CPUs that will be filling a laptop near you . Now , there are n't a lot of details in this leak tweeted out by InstLatX64 , but what is there seems incredibly solid . It 's a 4-core , 8-thread processor , with a boost clock of 3.4GHz . The big jump up over Ice Lake , however , is going to be the 12MB of L3 cache . # Intel TigerLake-U ( Willow Cove , Gen12 GPU ) Bootlog CPUID 860C0 : https : //t.co/CS6hfAvJZE4c/8t , 1000- > 3400MHz , 12MB L3 , all AVX512* pic.twitter.com/gjVO2IAx0fSeptember 16 , 2019 For comparison 's sake , the top-end Ice Lake Intel Core i7-1068G7 only features 8MB of L3 cache , so this mystery processor , if real , will feature 1MB more cache per core than its 10th generation predecessor . The bump up in cache should result in much faster performance , and may even make Tiger Lake-equipped Ultrabooks viable for gaming – but we do n't want to get too ahead of ourselves . Speaking of gaming , the leak also says this Tiger Lake-U processor will feature a Generation 12 GPU . This is n't too terribly surprising , but seeing the massive improvements Intel Gen 11 graphics offer over previous generations , we ca n't wait to see what it can do . We 're still quite a ways out from this processor actually seeing the light of day – if it does , indeed , see the light of day – so you should take all of this with a gigantic grain of salt . Still , Intel has gone a long way by iterating and refining its 14nm Skylake architecture , so it will be interesting to see where Team Blue goes with its 10nm process : it 's just getting started .

World of Tanks is one of the most popular games in the world , and at its annual Wargaming Fest : Tanker Day event , it was announced that Intel is working with the devs to bring ray tracing technology to the game for any DirectX 11 graphics card – not just Nvidia ’ s latest RTX cards . This is exciting news , as ray tracing , which is a realistic way of rendering light and shadows in games for impressively life-like effects , has previously only been available to people who own Nvidia ’ s latest RTX range of graphics cards , such as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 . That meant anyone using AMD GPUs , or even older Nvidia cards like the GTX 1080 Ti , would not be able to experience the new tech – until now . Wargaming – the devs responsible for World of Tanks – announced that its “ Ray Tracing ( RT ) technology developed ... with close collaboration with Intel… further immerses you in an atmosphere of furious tank combat and provides an even more enjoyable gameplay experience . ” Most importantly , the tech “ will work on all graphics cards that support DirectX 11 API and higher. ” This means that it won ’ t matter what brand of GPU you have , as long as it supports DirectX 11 – which most modern high-end GPUs do – then you ’ ll be able to experience ray tracing . The tech allows Wargaming to “ recreate the 'main actors ' of [ the ] game in higher quality ; their smallest details will give super-realistic shadows when the sun hits them . ” We certainly welcome technology that allows more people to experience ray tracing , though there are some caveats , as the effects only work on “ intact vehicles that are in direct sunlight . ” Still , it ’ s a start , and hopefully we ’ ll see more examples of ray tracing coming to non-RTX GPUs in the future .

It appears that Microsoft could be launching a 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 which will run on AMD Ryzen processors at its Surface hardware event on October 2 . If true , this will be the first time AMD hardware would be powering a Surface device – as previously Microsoft has stuck to Intel processors . It would certainly be a big win for AMD – and a nasty blow for Intel – if that is the case . Microsoft ’ s Surface devices are premium products that are supposed to show off what Windows 10 devices are capable of , so having AMD hardware in them could be seen as a strong recommendation from Microsoft . The rumors , reported by WinFuture , come from entries in non-public databases of European retailers , which leads the website to claim that it is “ confident that the new Surface Laptop 3 15-inch model will definitely be equipped with AMD CPUs . ” The Surface Laptop 3 is also rumored to have a 15-inch display – with previous models only offering 13-inch screens . By offering a 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 , Microsoft is able to target people who are looking for a larger laptop . While we don ’ t know what AMD chips Microsoft would use for a 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 ( if one even exists ) , WinFuture suggests that the AMD Ryzen 5 3550H and the Ryzen 7 3750H are likely candidates , due to being powerful quad-core chips with integrated AMD Radeon RX Vega graphics – which makes them ideal for powering a large-screen laptop . We ’ ll be attending the Surface event on October 2 ourselves , and if the Surface Laptop 3 is there , you can be sure we ’ ll get our hands on it and report back .

Intel has had an interesting year : it 's put out two new lines of laptop CPUs in Ice Lake and Comet Lake , and has been outsold by AMD 's Ryzen 3rd Generation chips on the desktop side . But , Intel may have something in store for us at Tokyo Game Show 2019 . Intel Japan came out on Twitter and said it would be making a `` serious announcement regarding PC games for 2020 '' at TGS 2019 . And , with the Intel Core i9-9900KS right around the corner in October , we might end up seeing Intel announce its long-awaited Xe graphics card . インテルからの重大発表！明日13:30 から東京ゲームショウのインテルブースで2020年に向けたPCゲームに関する重大発表を行います。どんな内容が飛び出すか、楽しみにお待ちください！ # TGS2019 # インテルでゲーミング # intel pic.twitter.com/KgcZnHB6DtSeptember 12 , 2019 ... just do n't get too excited yet , as there 's a chance this is n't something big . Intel entering into an entirely new market with a graphics card would be something we 'd expect to see at one of the big tech shows like CES 2020 or Computex . We are starting to see some tech companies launch gaming-centric products at gaming shows – like with AMD launching its Navi graphics cards at E3 2019 – but an Intel graphics card for consumers might be too big of an announcement . So , what could it be ? Well , we could see Intel announce some new software solutions for gamers , as it spent most of Gamescom 2019 talking about how it makes the best hardware and software for games . We have also seen some leaks that suggest that Intel may be planning a Phantom Canyon NUC for next year to finally dethrone the excellent Hades Canyon NUC . Either way , we have no idea what Intel has planned for the Tokyo Games Show , but we 'd love to be surprised with a new graphics card . Until then , we 'll just have to wait and see what Intel is planning . Via PCGamesN

Update : Intel has been in contact to say that the original Product Change Notification ( PCN ) it released had incorrect information , and it has since released a new PCN . According to Intel , `` There are no changes to the B-1 Stepping of the Intel Celeron N3350 , J3355 , J3455 Processors and Intel Pentium N4200 Processor as they meet all Intel quality goals for PC Usage and will continue to be available . The F-1 Apollo Lake Intel Celeron N3350 , J3355 , J3455 Processors and Intel Pentium N4200 Processor meet all Intel quality goals for PC Usage . With IOTG 's operational decision to converge onto a single package for all of the IOTG Apollo Lake Processors , the F-1 stepping Celeron N3350 , J3355 , J3455 Processors and Pentium N4200 Processor has a slight increase in Z height compared to the B-1 Stepping . '' Original story follows ... Although they were only released in 2016 , there are reports that Intel Apollo Lake processors are dying sooner than expected . According to a Product Change Notification ( PCN ) document , which isn ’ t currently available online , but reported on by Tom ’ s Hardware , Intel is planning to replace four of its Celeron and Pentium Apollo Lake processors due to degradation in performance . According to Intel , it has “ identified an issue with the Low Pin Count ( LPC ) , Real Time Clock ( RTC ) , SD Card interfaces on Intel Celeron N3350 , J3355 , J3455 processors and Intel Pentium N4200 processor resulting in degradation of these signals at a rate higher than Intel 's quality goals after multiple years in service . ” Essentially , Intel is saying that these Apollo Lake processors , which are based on its Goldmont microarchitecture and 14nm process node , could die before the warranty is up – so Intel is planning on refreshing the entire Apollo Lake lineup . Intel Apollo Lake processors are mainly found in budget laptops and desktops , as well as 2-in-1 devices and all-in-one PCs , and the affected CPUs are the Celeron J3455 , J3355 , N3350 and Pentium N4200 . Intel has previously had problems with LPC bus degradation – which seems to be the problem here – with its Atom C2000 series of processors , as well as its E3800 series CPUs – which led Intel to creating a reserve fund to cover the costs of replacing the processors . The affected Apollo Lake processors will move from the old B1 stepping to new F1 stepping in a bid to avoid the problem , and the new processors will have an ‘ E ’ suffix in their name to help customers identify the new CPUs – so they will be the Celeron J3455E , J3355E , N3350E and Pentium N4200E . According to Tom ’ s Hardware , Intel is telling its customers to move from their existing CPUs to the new versions . Of course , this is easier said than done , as many of the products the affected Apollo Lake processors are in are not easily upgradable – which means you may have to buy an entirely new device . We ’ ve contacted Intel to find out more , and will update this story when we hear back .
Intel is set to roll out a large-scale facial recognition technology system at next year 's Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games . The tech giant has unveiled details of its work with NEC that will see the latter 's NeoFace technology deployed across the Japanese capital in time for next year 's summer sporting extravaganza . The two companies will be teaming up on a `` large-scale face recognition system '' that will look to speed up the time it takes for athletes , coaches , volunteers and media to be processed through security checkpoints . Intel says that will be used to ensure a smooth and secure identification process for the 300,000 or so accredited people attendees at Tokyo 2020 , cutting down possible ID fraud and reducing long wait times for ID checks . `` This is a first , '' said Rick Echevarria , general manager of Intel ’ s Olympics Program , `` this is the first time that facial recognitiontechnology is going to be used for this purpose at the Olympic Games . '' NEC will be deploying `` hundreds '' of systems powered by Intel Core i5 processors at gates throughout the games , Echevarria aded , including the Athletes Village in Tokyo . Intel did n't go into much more details about exactly how NeoFace will work , and did not clarify where the data will be stored - but accredited attendees will still have to wear traditional lanyards to prove their identity . “ Intel is focused on delivering world-class technology integrations at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games to improve the experience for athletes , attendees , viewers and Games staff while also demonstrating how technology can transform businesses . We are excited to make the first of a series of announcements about our role in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games , ” Echevarria noted . “ The Winter Games in PyeongChang represented our first collaboration with the IOC and we look forward to extending and deepening that relationship in the years ahead . ”
Microsoft could be preparing to release a new Surface device powered by Intel ’ s upcoming Ice Lake processors , according to new benchmarks spotted online . Found by Windows Latest , Geekbench results seem to show a Surface Pro or Surface Laptop – named “ OEMJL OEMJL Product Name EV1.5A ” – running on a 10th generation Intel Core i5-1035G1 processor , which runs at 3.60GHz . Microsoft has previously used a similar naming convention for its Surface Go product on Geekbench , hence why some people think this could be a new Surface device . If the benchmark results are hinting at a new Surface device , then it ’ s very likely we ’ ll see it at Microsoft ’ s October 2 event – which , of course , we ’ ll be attending . We don ’ t know much about Microsoft ’ s October 2 plans , however it ’ ll be a whole year since Microsoft revealed new Surface hardware , and two years since it released the Surface Book 2 . That means it ’ s high time that Microsoft announced a new Surface product , and if it does , hopefully it will use Intel ’ s latest Ice Lake hardware , which will give it a decent performance upgrade over previous Surface devices . Thankfully , we won ’ t have long to find out , and whatever Microsoft does announce at its event , we ’ ll be there to test it out .

The CPU battle between Intel and AMD is the most exciting it ’ s been in years , with Intel ’ s once unassailable dominance now under threat by a resurgent AMD – and Intel has finally admitted that it is losing market share to AMD . The comments come from Jason Grebe , corporate vice president and general manager of Intel 's Cloud Platforms and Technology Group , who was speaking at the Citi Global Tech Conference who said that “ As we have gone through the supply issue kind of in the last six to 12 months on the PC side , we had to walk away from some low-end mobile share as well as some channel desktop share . ” So , while Intel hasn ’ t explicitly said that it ’ s losing to AMD , that ’ s what Grebe ’ s comments are hinting at , with Intel losing out on market share in budget laptops and with consumer desktop processors – areas that AMD has been growing in strength . AMD has seen huge success recently with its launch of its Ryzen 3000 series of processors , which launched to critical acclaim and impressive sales ( though not without its share of controversies ) , as well as an increase in AMD-powered laptops being sold , and that certainly seems to be putting the squeeze on Intel . While we ’ ve seen evidence of AMD taking market share from Intel , this has mainly been based on individual stores . Intel ’ s revelation is the first official statement we ’ ve had from the company about its struggles . While Grebe ’ s comments alluded to losing market share against AMD ( despite not mentioning the company by name ) , it seems Intel isn ’ t keen on giving AMD too much credit for the loss of market share , and instead blames the supply issues that hit Intel last year – which undoubtedly played a part , though we think AMD ’ s improved products and competitive pricing plays as much of a role as well . So , what is Intel going to do ? As Grebe says , Intel is looking to get “ more aggressive ” in a bid to win back market share . This could involve becoming more competitive with AMD when it comes to price and performance – with Intel promising that its Cascade Lake-X processors , which are due in October , will offer 2.09 times more in terms of relative performance per dollar than Skylake-X – and could then also put the squeeze on AMD , which has traditionally offered a better price and performance proposition . We may also see Intel calling out AMD more when it comes to the latter ’ s controversies . Intel was keen to stress that its Core i9-9900KS processor will get a turbo speed boost to 5GHz on all cores – in a clear dig at AMD , and the recent controversy over Ryzen 3000 processors not hitting their advertised boost speeds . We ’ d also like to see Intel becoming more aggressive when it comes to innovation . While Intel admitted that it won ’ t ship 7nm chips until 2021 – unlike AMD which already has 7nm chips on the market – the company will surely be looking at ways to win back customers its lost to AMD . With a resurgent AMD and an aggressive Intel ready to fight back , the real winners of the CPU wars will be us , the consumers . Bring it on !

Maybe it ’ s the fact that IFA 2019 has finally melted my brain , but I ’ ve been thinking a lot about the processor war between AMD and Intel , and how it apes a certain space-bound series of films set in a galaxy far , far away . While it ’ s a bit too easy ( and simplistic ) to paint Intel as the big bad Empire , and AMD as the plucky Rebel Alliance that wants to overthrow Team Blue 's tyranny , I don ’ t think AMD ’ s story – for the moment at least – resembles the original Star Wars trilogy . Instead , I worry that it ’ s more like the Prequel trilogy . And yes… that means it ’ s not good news . In this scenario , AMD is Anakin Skywalker while Intel is the Emperor . I guess that makes Qualcomm Jar Jar Binks . Now you might think that comparing Intel to an evil guy with a melted face that shoots lightning from his fingers is just as reductive as comparing it to the Empire , but what do you expect from someone who just made a Jar Jar Binks joke in 2019 ? Anyway , hear me out . The crux of the matter is that AMD is gunning hard to take down Intel , but there ’ s worrying signs that by trying to defeat Intel , it ’ s turning to the dark side . The thing is , AMD is supposed to be the good guy . For a good few years now , AMD has enjoyed some excellent press . Its enthusiast Threadripper CPUs showed us that you can have consumer processors with huge core counts and still be ( relatively ) affordable , and its recent AMD Ryzen 3000 series of processors launched to great critical acclaim ( unlike the Prequel trilogy ) . This has led to stellar sales – with AMD ’ s shipments of its Ryzen 5 3600 chip almost equalling Intel ’ s entire CPU sales in some markets . Considering how dominant Intel has been for so long , this is a remarkable turnaround . And so AMD , like Anakin , was feted as the chosen one . In Star Wars terms , AMD now had midichlorians out of the wazoo . But , like Anakin , AMD liked its taste of power and wanted more , and the dark side was there to tempt it ( don ’ t worry , I ’ m probably going to drop the Star Wars stuff now , as even I ’ m bored of it ) . The first sign of trouble was news that a long-running class action lawsuit against AMD for its claims about its Bulldozer CPUs had been settled – with AMD having to pay out $ 12.1 million . Back when AMD launch its FX Bulldozer processors , it claimed that it was the “ first native eight-core desktop processor ” in adverts – in a clear bid to win customers away from Intel . `` In Star Wars terms , AMD now had midichlorians out of the wazoo . '' However , while AMD argued that having four Bulldozer modules which each feature two CPU cores was enough to term the FX Bulldozer as an eight-core processor , many customers felt deceived , as they were not “ real ” cores , as they shared resources including a single floating point unit ( FPU ) . Being taken to court by customers who felt deceived by your marketing ( and losing ) is not a good look , and AMD was probably hoping this would all be forgotten about . Maybe we ’ d all move on , and AMD would quietly learn its lesson about over-promising in a bid to score a win over Intel . Only problem is… that didn ’ t happen . Instead , AMD has been getting in more hot water after it was discovered that its Ryzen 3000 CPUs don ’ t hit their advertised boost speeds . A well-known overclocker , Der8auer , surveyed just over 2,700 users and found that only 5.6 % of Ryzen 9 3900X owners reported that their processor reached its rated boost clock . Der8auer found that only 14.7 % of chips were hitting the advertised boost speed of 4.4GHz or more ( only 1.8 % of respondents actually bettered that speed with their processor ) . The vast majority – 85.3 % – weren ’ t ever reaching the advertised boost speed at all , on any core . So , was AMD selling processors with a promise of speeds that its products were unable to achieve ? Sadly , it looks like that might have been the case . Anger over this has been mounting , and Intel even took a swipe at AMD when it announced that its upcoming Core i9-9900KS processor will reach 5GHz across all cores . `` I love the fact that AMD is bringing the heat to Intel – but I want it to do it without resorting to cheap tricks . '' There was even talk of another lawsuit being levelled at AMD over this , though there ’ s of course a risk of it just being a disappointing follow-up… oh right , I dropped the Star Wars schtick didn ’ t I ? Anyway , AMD has promised that a fix is coming to boost speeds – with the company claiming a firmware issue is to blame for the chips not reaching advertised speeds . Now , I ’ m inclined to take AMD at its word on this , so maybe this wasn ’ t the sneaky move that some people have been accusing it of being . But , there ’ s still a lot of anger over how AMD kept quiet about all of this . I love the fact that AMD is bringing the heat to Intel – but I wish it could do it without resorting to cheap tricks . It ’ s better than that . Stick to the high ground , AMD . We all know how that turns out .

The latest Steam Hardware and Software survey has been released , giving us a glimpse of the what kind of hardware PC gamers are using – and it seems AMD and Nvidia have a lot to be a happy about , though the picture is less rosy for Intel . Earlier this year we reported how the Steam Hardware survey had shown Intel increasing its dominance in the processor market , while AMD struggled , but the most recent Steam Hardware survey for August 2019 shows AMD has reversed its fortunes , with the number of people using AMD processors growing – at Intel ’ s expense . AMD recently released its Ryzen 3000 series of processors to rave reviews ( despite some controversy over their inability to hit promised boost speeds ) , which has likely helped AMD recover lost ground against Intel , with the share of people with AMD processors increasing by 0.96 % compared to the month before , with Intel ’ s share dropping by the same amount . This is certainly encouraging for AMD , though the company still has a long way to go , as despite Intel ’ s CPU market share amongst Steam gamers dropping , it still dominated with 81.04 % of the market , compared to AMD ’ s 18.95 % . However , even with its dominant position , this month ’ s shift is something Intel will not want to become a trend . On the graphics side of things , Nvidia continues to dominate , with the entire top ten of most popular GPUs being from Team Green . The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 continues to be the most popular GPU used by Steam gamers , followed by the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti and GeForce GTX 1050 . However , what should really please Nvidia is that its recent RTX line of graphics cards are slowly but surely increasing in popularity , with the GeFroce RTX 2070 being the most popular of the RTX cards , up 0.19 % compared to last month . The RTX 2060 and RTX 2080 also saw gains , which Nvidia will be pleased about , showing that gamers are gradually moving to its newer cards . AMD only managed to get to number 11 with its most-used card , the Radeon RX 580 , and that also saw a modest bump in market share with 0.07 % . While the Steam Hardware & Software Survey only logs Steam customers ( and ones who have opted into the survey ) , due to the huge popularity of Steam , it gives us an excellent idea of what kind of hardware and operating system PC gamers are using , and this month both AMD and Nvidia will be pleased to see their products growing in popularity . Intel , on the other hand , may not be so happy , and could be hoping its launch of its new Core i9-9900KS in October will reverse its decline in market share . Via TechSpot

Over at IFA 2019 , Intel held a press event in which it revealed that the Core i9-9900KS – a processor capable of reaching 5GHz across all of its eight cores , which was first unveiled back at Computex – will go on sale in October . This is essentially a binned version of the Core i9-9900K , meaning Intel has cherry-picked the best silicon from those parts – the chips capable of actually reaching 5GHz across all cores ( normally , the 9900K only reaches 5GHz with single-core Turbo ) . While Intel revealed that the 9900KS will hit shelves next month , sadly it didn ’ t indicate the price tag , or indeed reveal the TDP ( although it will doubtless be higher than the 95W of the base 9900K ) . What Intel did say was that the turbo speed of 5GHz means 5GHz , which clearly enough was a dig at AMD , and the recent controversy over Ryzen 3000 processors not hitting their advertised boost speeds ( due to a firmware bug , AMD claims , which the company has promised it ’ s now fixing ) . Indeed , to underline that , as spotted by The Guru of 3D , Intel showed one slide entitled ‘ questioning from the community ’ which highlighted the whole Ryzen 3000 boost episode and issues over ‘ clocks , performance consistency , [ and ] transparency ’ . As Tom ’ s Hardware further reports , Intel showed off a PC using the 9900KS running Hitman 2 and consistently reaching 5GHz across all cores , save for the odd ‘ dip ’ . The other point to note here , though , is that your cooling solution will need to be good enough to allow the 9900KS to stretch its full Turbo legs – on that Hitman 2 demo PC , Intel was using a Corsair 240mm AIO liquid cooler . Of course , the other thing to bear in mind is that the 9900KS is still a 14nm Coffee Lake Refresh processor , whereas Ryzen 3rd-gen chips are built on Zen 2 ( 7nm ) , AMD ’ s new architecture which offers an impressive performance boost in and of itself ( with a considerable uplift in IPC , or instructions per clock ) . Any boost clock niggles aside , we ’ ve tested the performance of Ryzen 3000 processors extensively , and come up hugely impressed , particularly with their value proposition . And of course the price tag of the 9900KS will be a key factor – which we don ’ t know yet . Intel also mentioned Cascade Lake-X at this press briefing , showing a slide which stated that these new chips are coming next month – so also in October – offering up to 2.09x more in terms of relative performance per dollar than Skylake-X . That seems to indicate that these new high-end desktop processors may benefit from lower pricing . Although a recent leak purporting to be from a Core i9 Cascade Lake-X 10-core processor didn ’ t leave us too impressed with how it shaped up compared to Ryzen Threadripper rivals , although we have to take any such pre-release leakage with a heavy pinch of salt , naturally . IFA 2019 is Europe 's biggest tech show , and the TechRadar team is in Berlin to bring you all the breaking news and hands-on first impressions of new TVs , laptops , wearables and other products as they 're announced .

At IFA 2019 , the huge tech show happening in Berlin , Germany , Intel has been talking up its vision of the future of laptops , and has brought along devices from big names such as Dell and HP . Crucially , it revealed more about its Project Athena innovation program , which is designed to shape the next generation of laptops , and will focus on improved performance , instant-on boot times , boosted connectivity and long battery lives . Throughout the week that IFA runs ( September 6 – September 11 ) , Intel and its partners will be showing off new Project Athena laptops , and we ’ ll be there to try them out . Intel has been promising big things with Project Athena – perhaps spooked by growing competition from AMD and Qualcomm – so we want to see if these new laptops can live up to the hype . “ Project Athena-based laptops will deliver what our members desire with improved performance , instant on , intelligence , great battery life and improved connectivity all in new , beautiful , sleek form factors . We ’ re excited to partner with Intel to be at the forefront of PC innovation , ” said Jon Bubitz , general manager for PC Business at Costco . While Intel hasn ’ t disclosed what Project Athena laptops it ’ ll be unveiling , these new laptops will be joining the following devices that have already been confirmed to be part of Project Athena : “ With the Project Athena program , Intel and key brand partners are focused on delivering the most innovative devices for our customers , ” said Matthew Higginson , head of Category Computing , Windows & Chrome at Dixons Carphone . `` We ’ re excited to feature Project Athena-based laptops at Currys PC World as a great solution for our customers . ” Both already-announced Project Athena laptops , and the ones Intel will be revealing throughout the week at IFA , should start appearing in stores towards the end of 2019 . Intel is also going to be showing off laptops that run on its latest 10th generation Intel Core processors , with Acer , Asus , Lenovo , MSI and Razer all announcing new laptops . Again , we ’ ll try to get our hands on as many of these laptops as we can as they are announced to give an early verdict on this new generation . Make sure you keep an eye on TechRadar throughout IFA 2019 for the very latest laptop news and reviews .

Frontera was first announced in August of last year and the supercomputer was built in early 2019 at which time it earned the fifth spot on the top500 list of the world 's most advanced supercomputers . The system features Dell EMC PowerEdge servers outfitted with 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Frontera 's 8008 compute nodes can deliver peak performance of 38.75 petaFlops .
Intel seemingly has a clever new trick for its incoming Gen12 ( Xe ) graphics technology with a feature known as Display State Buffer ( DSB ) that will help relieve the workload on the CPU . Phoronix ( via Tom ’ s Hardware ) spotted the new DSB feature when it was referred to in a recent Linux kernel patch , and it pertains to Intel ’ s Gen12 graphics that will be in Tiger Lake processors ( 11th-gen mobile-focused chips expected to land next year ) and Xe discrete GPUs ( also expected to debut next year ) . DSB is described in technical documentation as a hardware capability which “ allows [ the ] driver to batch submit display HW programming . This helps to reduce loading time and CPU activity , thereby making the context switch faster . DSB Support added from Gen12 Intel graphics based platform . ” To put it in plain and simple terms , DSB will help take some of the strain off the CPU , and that ’ s a good thing for obvious reasons in terms of boosting performance in scenarios where this applies . Hopefully this will be another string to the bow of Intel ’ s 10nm Tiger Lake processors when it comes to helping them run a little faster . We ’ ve already heard that these mobile chips with integrated Gen12 graphics be will be able to run multiple 4K displays ( or indeed drive an 8K monitor ) . Intel dominates the processor market when it comes to laptops , but needs to keep innovating to stave off any challenges from AMD , with the latter already winning strongly in recent times when it comes to the enthusiast and desktop PC market .
A new report seems to indicate how serious Microsoft is about pushing forward with dual-screen laptops , claiming that the company has partnered up with Intel to develop common standards and shape the future for such devices . This comes from DigiTimes , which claims that Microsoft and Intel have recently begun establishing standards for dual-screen notebooks , and these are standards which will also be extended to laptops with a foldable screen ( in other words , just the one flexible display which folds in the middle using some kind of nifty under-screen hinge ) . We have , of course , seen plenty of patents and concepts from Microsoft as well as other laptop manufacturers showing off potential devices along these lines . Indeed , Lenovo already has its ThinkPad X1 foldable tablet prototype , Dell ’ s roadmap indicates a dual-screen XPS machine coming next year , and of course we ’ ve been hearing lots about Microsoft ’ s Surface Centaurus dual-screen laptop . However , we have to be somewhat wary about this DigiTimes report , as it isn ’ t always the most reliable source , and the article is rather short and sketchy on details – essentially providing nothing other than the above info . That said , it does make sense that Microsoft might want to hammer out some firm details in terms of standards that these machines should adhere to . Furthermore , we ’ ve already heard that Microsoft is working with Intel on the aforementioned Surface Centaurus , so a broader partnership also makes sense . As we ’ ve mentioned , the report doesn ’ t go as far as actually defining anything regarding what the allegedly incoming standards may be , but it ’ s easy enough to make a few guesses . There may well be certain baseline performance requirements for the devices , with Intel ’ s input on the processor side , of course . And ensuring a smooth-running dual-screen experience could mean requirements concerning the way in which the two screens must fit together to provide a suitably seamless experience ( vanishingly slim bezels or other methods may be used in this respect ) . We ’ ve already seen a Microsoft patent for technology to ensure that the two screens don ’ t have any inconsistencies between them and are suitably uniform when displaying content . This would likely be a key consideration , given that if there were differences between the dual displays , they would stand out like a sore thumb when an image , app or web page is shown across both screens . Moreover , Microsoft may want to stipulate a version of Windows that the devices should run – potentially Windows Lite – and we already know that the software giant has been looking into exactly how its OS should be presented over two screens . Other requirements might possibly include stipulations for the quality of the touchscreen ( s ) , which would also be a key aspect here . Enough with the guessing , though – if there is truth behind this report , we will likely hear about these standards soon enough . Microsoft has a big Surface event coming up at the start of October , and who knows , we might just see Centaurus unveiled there . Via MSPowerUser
Benchmark results have leaked that apparently show that the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx will have a considerable leap in power over its predecessors , and can even rival the mid-range Intel Core i5 family of processors . Previous Snapdragon chipsets included in Windows 10 laptops have offered long battery lives ( over 20 hours ) and smartphone-like features such as instant boot times and always-connected cellular data , but they have suffered from poor performance compared to laptops with more traditional processors from Intel and AMD – while also being pretty expensive . So , the fact that the upcoming Snapdragon 8cx will apparently offer hugely improved performance is incredibly exciting , and means future Windows 10 on Snapdragon devices could finally deliver on the promises Qualcomm and Microsoft have made about the platform . According to the Geekbench benchmark results , the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx is clocked at 2.84GHz and has eight cores . It managed a single-core score of 3,327 and a multi-core score of 11,154 . As MSPowerUser points out , this compares favorably with the Intel Core i5-8250U , which manages 3,659 single-core and 11,192 multi-core . It ’ s also a big leap over the new Snapdragon 850 . In our review of the Lenovo Yoga C630 , which runs on the chip , it scored 2,291 ( single-core ) ; 7,101 ( multi-core ) in the same benchmarks . Unlike previous Snapdragon chips , which were designed primarily for smartphones and tablets and then ported to laptops , the Snapdragon 8cx is Qualcomm ’ s first chipset that ’ s been built from the ground up for computers first and foremost – and it looks like that has paid off with a big leap in performance . We ’ ll be seeing an influx of Snapdragon 8cx-powered laptops later this year – with Lenovo announcing Project Limitless back at Computex , which it claims will be the first 5G Snapdragon 8cx laptop . If these benchmarks are correct , it means we ’ ll finally see Snapdragon laptops that offer huge battery lives without compromising on performance – and they could even play the odd game . The future of laptops is getting very exciting indeed .

Apple ’ s MacBook Air , which was refreshed not so long ago in July , will be updated again before the year is out , with a beefier processor being introduced according to a new rumor . This comes from analyst firm IHS Markit , which told Forbes that the MacBook Air will receive another update in 2019 , without offering any details on what will be introduced save for the fact that the new model will come with a 10th-gen Intel processor . The previous July refresh added True Tone technology to the MacBook Air ’ s Retina display ( to automatically modify the color temperature for a more comfortable viewing experience – and more natural colors ) , as well as giving the entry-level model a price cut . In our MacBook Air 2019 review , we noted that True Tone was a useful addition , although not hugely compelling , and we were more concerned about the refreshed MacBook Air being hampered by sticking with the dual-core Intel Core i5-8210Y processor , which leaves the machine feeling “ underpowered and overpriced ” ( despite that price cut ) . As we further noted in our review , it seemed odd that Apple didn ’ t hold off this refresh until it could get one of Intel ’ s new quad-core mobile chips in the MacBook Air , but according to this speculation , that ’ s exactly what ’ s about to happen . IHS Markit believes that the new MacBook Air will run with an Amber Lake processor , and this is where matters get slightly confusing thanks to Intel ’ s convoluted and frankly at times incomprehensible naming conventions . In fact , it seems that the new processor will be one of Intel ’ s freshly-revealed Comet Lake models , 10th-gen CPUs which will be headed up by the quad-core Intel Core i7-10510Y in the Y series ( ultra-low-power and highly efficient mobile chips ) . The confusion on IHS Markit ’ s part seemingly arose due to the fact that these 10th-gen Y series chips are actually referred to as ‘ products formerly Amber Lake Y ’ in Intel ’ s processor product specifications database – as are some 8000 series chips . Why are they labelled like that ? That ’ s anyone ’ s guess , although it does seem that Intel is wilfully – and mystifyingly – obtuse with these names at times . Anyway , Intel actually confirmed to Forbes that the aforementioned Core i7-10510Y is indeed a Comet Lake chip , and we don ’ t really have to worry about the name too much . The point is that the allegedly incoming MacBook Air will have a 10th-gen quad-core CPU – it ’ s not clear which one , mind – to drive a much-needed leap forward on the performance front . If the analyst firm is on the money , of course , but let ’ s hope this is the case , as it will remedy the biggest issue we have with 2019 ’ s refreshed MacBook Air .
AMD ’ s Ryzen success story continues , with a single Ryzen 3rd-gen processor coming close to selling as much as Intel ’ s entire CPU range , according to the latest statistics from one European retailer . As highlighted on Reddit , German-based Mindfactory declared that AMD ’ s processors took 78 % of sales for August , almost as much as in July when the company managed to bag 79 % . Naturally , that left Intel on 22 % of units sold for August , and once again , AMD wasn ’ t far off equaling the sales of Intel ’ s entire range of CPUs with one single Ryzen product – except this time the chip which managed that feat was a different one . Last month , AMD ’ s top performer was the Ryzen 7 3700X , but that ’ s now in second place in terms of individual CPU sales , with the Ryzen 5 3600 taking the top spot . Indeed , the latter actually sold more than all of Intel ’ s 9th-gen offerings put together . So , there appears to be no slowdown in the popularity of Ryzen 3000 since the new Zen 2 processors were launched , at least going by this particular retailer – although we must note , as ever , that this represents a limited picture of the CPU market . However , it does reflect what we ’ re seeing more broadly : namely that Ryzen chips are seeing wider adoption among PC enthusiasts . When it comes to laptops , and the business world , however , it ’ s a very different story with Intel in the clear lead still . It ’ s also worth remembering that AMD has more to come in the form of the Ryzen 9 3950X at the top-end , and a rumored Ryzen 5 3500 coming into play at the other end of the CPU spectrum . Plus the prospect of massively powerful Ryzen Threadripper 3000 processors launching before 2019 is out . We don ’ t really need to add that Intel should obviously be concerned about how the processor landscape is changing , so it ’ s not surprising that Intel has been getting rather defensive of late – although the company may have some answers up its sleeve in the form of Comet Lake .

Intel processors are vulnerable to exploitation if they are running hyper-threading , and if you want full security for your CPU , you should disable that feature ( which will obviously come at a considerable performance hit in some cases ) . This is according to Greg Kroah-Hartman , a Linux kernel developer who shared his thoughts on security at the Open Source Summit Europe in Lyons ( which finishes today ) , as highlighted by The Register . The problem as outlined by Kroah-Hartman – and indeed others – is that hyper- threading is dangerous territory because of bugs that can be exploited in MDS or Microarchitectural Data Sampling . If that sounds familiar , you might have remembered it from the ZombieLoad episode back in May , where it first came to light along with other MDS-based exploits including Fallout and RIDL . The only way to be truly safe from any potential attack vector along these lines is simply to switch off hyper-threading . Kroah-Hartman said of OpenBSD ( an open source security-focused OS ) : “ A year ago they said disable hyper-threading , there ’ s going to be lots of problems here . They chose security over performance at an earlier stage than anyone else . Disable hyper-threading . That ’ s the only way you can solve some of these issues . We are slowing down your workloads . Sorry . ” You might further recall that when ZombieLoad stumbled onto the scene , Apple advised that the only way Mac users could be sure of ‘ full mitigation ’ against attacks was not just to apply the relevant security patches , but also to disable hyper- threading ( at an up to 40 % performance hit for some users , Apple estimated ) . Hyper-threading , for the uninitiated , is where a CPU core is split into two virtual cores ( or threads ) , and it can help considerably with heavier tasks and workloads requiring multiple cores ( AMD calls this simultaneous multi-threading or SMT ) . But splitting tasks across cores in this manner can lead to potential problems , as Kroah-Hartman explains : “ MDS is where one program can read another program ’ s data . That 's a bad thing when you are running in a shared environment such as cloud computing , even between browser tabs . “ You can cross virtual machine boundaries with a lot of this . MDS exploits the fact that CPUs are hyper-threaded , with multiple cores on the same die that share caches . When you share caches , you can detect what the other CPU core was doing . ” In short , exploiting these vulnerabilities can actually let an attacker steal data from an application that they wouldn ’ t otherwise be able to access . A further worry is that there are so many of these potential issues and variants of speculative execution attacks therein , that a ton of patching is needed on a pretty constant basis – indeed fixes are still being deployed for the initial Spectre bug from two years ago . That ’ s why you need to have all the latest security patches for your OS , and the latest BIOS version , although even then , with hyper-threading running there ’ s the possibility of vulnerabilities which haven ’ t been found yet lurking in the background . Hence all the advice on being truly secure pointing to disabling hyper-threading . Kroah-Hartman adds : “ If you ’ re not using a supported distro , or a stable long-term kernel , you have an insecure system . It ’ s that simple . All those embedded devices out there , that are not updated , totally easy to break . ” The Internet of Things , of course , has long been a major concern on the security front . You may recall that earlier this year , AMD took the time to clarify that its processors are immune to ZombieLoad and these MDS vulnerabilities , and the Linux developer confirmed that using simultaneous multi-threading with AMD chips is indeed a safe option ( going by what ’ s known at the current time , anyway ) . However , before all Intel processor owners go running for the hills in a panic about flawed security , bear in mind that the actual odds of being targeted by such an attack are likely to be fairly slim outside of the corporate world . It ’ s not clear how many speculative execution vulnerabilities have actually been leveraged by attackers to good ( or rather bad ) effect to date , simply because it ’ s very hard to even detect these intrusions . The average home user probably won ’ t ever be targeted , but there ’ s the rub – ‘ probably ’ is a very different word to ‘ definitely ’ , and it still comes back to the fact that if you want your Intel PC to be truly secure from these kind of attacks , hyper-threading remains a potential hole in your computer ’ s security . And of course , it ’ s also worth noting that all this is happening against a backdrop of Intel allegedly bringing hyper-threading to the entire range of its next-gen Comet Lake processors .

It seems like Intel has had enough of AMD enjoying a process lead , with CEO Bob Swan confirming on a recent earnings call that Intel is “ investing to recapture process leadership going forward ” , and that it expects to launch its first 7nm products by the third quarter of 2021 . While Intel has been shipping 10nm and 14nm processors ( and struggling with 14nm – more on that in a bit ) , its rival AMD has already hit the market with 7nm products with the likes of the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X . Intel has in the past admitted that it won ’ t catch up with AMD ’ s 7nm process until 2021 , but at the time it told us that its 10nm process is comparable with AMD ’ s 7nm process . That might be so , but it seems like Intel doesn ’ t want to allow AMD to have the process lead any longer . Swan also revealed that it will be moving back to a two-year development cycle , similar to its tick-tock model that it had been using from 2007 to 2016 . The tick-tock model meant that Intel first worked on a new microarchitecture ( tock ) , which was then followed , roughly one year to 18 months later , by a die shrink of the process technology ( tick ) which refined and optimised the architecture . This model helped Intel to keep the process lead , but in 2016 it changed to its “ Process , Architecture , Optimization '' model , which essentially added a third stage for optimization . The company won ’ t be dropping its 10nm process though , and will be ramping up production . Swan made these comments in an earnings call about Intel ’ s third quarter 2019 performance , which he remarked was “ the best quarter in our company 's history ” , with Intel generating $ 19.2 billion in revenue . Intel ’ s new data-centric business model , which focuses on servers , the cloud and Internet of Things devices , is mainly to thank for its record results . However , Intel ’ s traditional PC-centric business struggled , with PC revenue down 5 % YoY , roughly what it expected following on from its second quarter results earlier this year . As the company had hoped back then , demand for its new 10nm Ice Lake processors has helped offset that drop – with Intel flooding the market with 30 designs by the end of 2019 . This will hopefully have a positive impact on Intel ’ s fourth quarter results . During the earnings call , it was also revealed that Intel is still struggling with supply issues for its 14nm process . “ We are working hard to regain supply demand balance . But we expect to continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter , '' Swan admits . Intel hopes to meet demands by 2020 by increasing its 14nm capacity . Via TechSpot
We ’ re still a long way away from seeing Intel ’ s Tiger Lake-U processors in thin and light laptops – they won ’ t likely hit the shelves until 2020 . However , that hasn ’ t stopped the rumor mills of the computing world from spreading leaks and speculations about these 10nm chips . The latest of those leaks suggests that these next generation processors might be compatible with LPDDR5 memory . According to Tom ’ s Hardware , hardware leaker @ KOMACI_ENSAKA recently shared on Twitter a Eurasian Economic Commission ( EEC ) notification – registered on October 18 – that shows Tiger Lake-U chips that use LPDDR4X and LPDDR5 memory ( RAM ) . This is excellent news for thin and light laptop fans everywhere , especially those who are waiting until next year to upgrade their somewhat aging laptops . That ’ s because LPDDR5 ’ s data transfer rate can be maxed out at a whopping 6,400 Mbps – compared to LPDDR4 ’ s 3,200 Mbps and LPDDR4X ’ s 4,266 Mbps . Improvements doesn ’ t just stop there : LPDDR5 is also supposed to consume less power – up to 30 % less than LPDDR4X , and has `` deep sleep '' power-saving mode available . These features are key to making the Intel Tiger Lake-U chips ideal to power the next generation of thin and light laptops , as these devices are expected to offer considerably longer battery life , to start . That ’ s not all . Last month , we also saw a bootlog , shared by @ InstLatX64 , showcasing its specs . This solid leak shows Tiger Lake-U to boast four cores , eight threads for Hyper-Threading , a base clock of 1.0 GHz and a boost clock of 3.4 GHz – a massive and promising jump over Ice Lake . Aside from this latest leak , the 10nm Ice Lake-U successor is also anticipated to feature Generation 12 graphics ( GPU ) . That ’ s on top of benchmarks we ’ ve seen showing one of these processors giving the Core i7-8665U and Ryzen 7 3700U a run for their money .

Intel ’ s first standalone Xe graphics card has been officially ‘ powered on ’ and is now in a functional working state , ready for further testing . Chief executive Bob Swan revealed that the GPU had been powered on for the first time in Intel ’ s latest earnings report , as spotted by Wccftech . The graphics card in question is known as DG1 , which presumably stands for ‘ development graphics ’ and DG1 is essentially the first working prototype model . Chris Hook , Intel ’ s Graphics and Visual Technologies Marketing Chief , announced the event more dramatically on Twitter . It ’ s alive ! October 24 , 2019 In the past , references have turned up via the rumor mill to DG1 and DG2 Intel cards , but at any rate , the chip giant clearly has one discrete GPU up and running now , whatever flavor it might be – consumer or enterprise – and whatever performance level it may have . None of those details have emerged yet . All Intel has said about the nature of its initial Xe offering ( s ) is that it will be targeting the mainstream market , but the company intends to eventually provide a full range of graphics cards from budget to high-end . The next step for the prototype DG1 graphics card will obviously be a whole load of testing and refinement , which will have to be done in fairly short order if Intel is to meet the mid-2020 launch date which has been previously rumored . Despite the mid-2020 speculation actually stemming from a hint dropped on Twitter by Raja Koduri , Intel ’ s chief architect , Chris Hook has previously tweeted that the launch timeframe Intel is looking at is late 2020 – although that was some seven months ago now . At any rate , what ’ s clear is that Intel wants this first discrete GPU out at some point next year , although a lot will obviously depend on exactly how development goes from here . You could say that slippage isn ’ t unknown at Intel ( ahem ) , particularly looking at the recent track record in the CPU arena… Hook ’ s ‘ it ’ s alive ’ Frankenstein reference could be quite apt in some ways , and not just because Halloween is almost upon us . Remember that we ’ ve previously heard Intel could be gunning for a slick implementation of multi-GPU , so stitching multiple graphics cards together – as it were – to make a more powerful monster gaming rig could be part of the strategy to defeat AMD and Nvidia . Or at least to try and get on level terms with those two established players in the graphics card market , because Intel will certainly need some kind of an angle to do that . The other obvious avenue of attack could be on price , and consumers everywhere will doubtless be hoping that this particular eventuality might come to pass – although we wouldn ’ t bet on it . Then again , Intel is allegedly prepared to chuck a whole wedge of money at propping up processor sales , so who knows – anything is possible ( although that particular CPU rumor should certainly be treated with a great deal of caution ) .

AMD has officially confirmed that it ’ s currently working on developing Zen 5 , which will be shaped and honed alongside Zen 4 , with the design of Zen 3 – the successor to the existing Zen 2 architecture which powers current Ryzen ( and Epyc ) CPUs and Navi GPUs – already done and dusted . As spotted by Wccftech , Mark Papermaster , CTO and Executive VP at AMD , made the revelations while speaking over at the Epyc Horizon Executive Summit , which happened a week ago in Rome . He said that the design of Zen 3 was complete , with both Zen 4 and Zen 5 now in the design phase , and that this was all part of AMD ’ s commitment to get back to leadership performance – and stay there going forward . Apparently the Zen 5 and Zen 4 core designs are being developed by two separate ‘ leapfrogging ’ design teams , with Zen 4 planned to arrive in 2022 . So at a guess , Zen 5 might possibly be very loosely penciled in for 2024 . The fact that the Zen architecture is being kept on for a fifth iteration shows the faith AMD has in its design . Zen 2 uses a 7nm process and ushered in some very impressive performance boosts compared to the original Zen architecture , with IPC ( instructions per clock ) seeing a 15 % or so increase . Zen 3 will move to 7nm+ ( a refined 7nm process ) and the rumor mill reckons that it will witness an IPC increase of something like 8 % to 10 % compared to Zen 2 . Chips based on Zen 3 ( Ryzen 4000 ) are expected to launch in the latter half of 2020 , and shouldn ’ t require a new motherboard if you ’ re upgrading from a Ryzen 3000 processor . Another piece of juicy speculation that ’ s been whispered about in recent times contends that Ryzen 4000 will also move forward in terms of simultaneous multithreading , with the possibility of having four threads per core ( as opposed to two threads currently ) . In other words , we could see dual-core processors with 8-threads , and quad-core with 16-threads . In short , it ’ s clear AMD wants to push firmly down on the gas pedal , which is not surprising when it ’ s winning big against Intel right now , with the rival chip giant forced to implement huge price cuts to some of its processors ( with the prospect of more of the same potentially in the pipeline , too ) . Incidentally , Mark Papermaster recently blogged for us on the subject of how AMD is using chiplets in processor design as part of the solution to the inexorable slowdown of Moore ’ s Law .

The word from the CPU rumor mill is that Intel is planning more major price cuts , and following slashing the asking prices of the incoming Cascade Lake-X processors , Skylake-X pricing will be decimated in line with that . As you may well be aware , Intel cut pricing on its Cascade Lake-X CPUs ( which are due in November ) more or less in half , and now according to German tech site Computer Base , similar cuts to the tune of up to 50 % are coming to Skylake-X , Intel ’ s current high-end desktop CPUs . Naturally , it makes sense that prices will have to be cut with the preceding generation once Cascade Lake-X is launched – otherwise we have a situation where the new CPUs are way cheaper than the last-gen Skylake-X . So who on earth would buy the latter ? So in a way , these price drops must happen for the remaining inventory of Skylake-X to be sold , and presumably retailers will be compensated by Intel for having to flog off these chips so ( relatively ) cheaply – otherwise they could be seriously out of pocket , and therefore seriously annoyed at the chip giant . That said , Computer Base observes that stock of Skylake-X is getting thin on the ground with some models anyway , which makes equal sense as Intel winds up production and prepares the next-gen CPUs for launch . But still , the upshot is if you want a cheap Skylake-X chip , then they could be available – at least for a time – in the near future , if this speculation is correct . Naturally those who have just purchased a Skylake-X model in recent times have every right to feel a little cheesed off ( again , assuming this comes to pass as reported ) . Intel is also slashing the prices of its Intel Xeon W CPUs , in the face of the growing threat from AMD – with the server market being a particular worry – and has made some more minor cuts to its bread-and-butter budget processors recently , too . Will we see more price cutting from Intel going forward ? This is far from out of the question , and indeed one recent theory is that Intel ’ s plan is to outmuscle AMD with $ 3 billion worth of CPU price cuts . Although this potential scenario is also playing out against rumors of continued stock shortages for Intel… Via Wccftech

Intel is serious about implementing multi-GPU with its incoming graphics cards , it would seem , with another clue emerging from the world of Linux showing that support for using a discrete GPU with an integrated solution is in the works . As spotted by Phoronix , changes made by Intel in the Linux 5.5 kernel include a section of code for handling the combination of a standalone graphics card and the integrated GPU on board an Intel processor . In other words , if you ’ ve got both an Intel GPU and CPU , that graphics card could enlist the help of the otherwise dormant integrated graphics on the processor to help out with whatever task is being tackled . You might be tempted to dismiss this out of hand as fairly irrelevant , given that integrated graphics aren ’ t likely to make much of an impact due to the lack of power therein , but the truth is that Intel is making great strides with its iGPUs , particularly with the latest generation of processors . So this could be a genuinely useful thing . Getting these two graphics elements to work in tandem shouldn ’ t be too problematic , given that discrete Xe video cards are essentially built from the same basic foundations ( Gen12 ) as Intel ’ s integrated graphics . Of course , ultimately we don ’ t know what ’ s behind this move – it could , for example , simply be a push with Linux to tap some extra power for basic compute workloads , and a long stretch away from implementing multi-GPU support with games . Multi-GPU is something both Nvidia and AMD have struggled with in the past , and neither company seems to be that keen on the technology these days , what with the tricky problems encountered in getting two ( or more ) GPUs to work seamlessly together without major issues and inefficiencies . But we ’ ve heard before that multi-GPU is something Intel is seriously pushing with , and more specifically an implementation which actually works to properly scale the power of two graphics cards . And that makes sense in some ways because if Intel ’ s initial graphics card struggles to compete directly on power with Nvidia or AMD to begin with – not an unimaginable scenario – then another route of attack would be the ability to double up with a second GPU . That would potentially make for a less painful upgrade path for consumers , too : buy one Intel Xe graphics card to begin with , then buy another one to further power up your rig down the line , splitting the cost and making it seem more palatable over time . Of course , these developments – if they happen at all – may be much further away than we might hope for . And indeed as we reported recently , it is possible Intel ’ s first Xe graphics card – allegedly arriving mid-2020 – might be aimed at the data center rather than consumers or gamers . As ever , we ’ ll have to see how all this pans out , but at the moment , all the rumors floating around are certainly pointing to Intel having a broader focus on multi-GPU as something it can capitalize on , and a potential advantage against AMD and Nvidia .

Earlier this year , Intel showed off the NUC Compute Element , previously known simply as The Element , and it was one of the best PC components at Computex . But , it was unclear just what sort of product we 'd see built around it . Now , the details are starting to come together . In a recent teardown from Chinese form KoolShare , spotted by Tom 's Hardware , we 've seen a glimpse of something called `` The Element '' inside Intel 's upcoming NUC 9 extreme . By all outward appearances , the NUC 9 Extreme is a fairly straightforward computer , albeit a small one . Intel 's trick with these NUC ( Next Unit of Computing ) devices , however , is to pack powerful desktop components into a small form factor . With the new NUC 9 Extreme , that appears to remain the case , even if it 's on the larger side at 238 x 216 x 96mm . Inside the NUC is where things get really interesting . At the base of the computer there 's a 500W power supply , but above that is what would seem like a motherboard until you realize there 's no CPU socket . Instead , there 's just a PCB with two PCIe 3.0 x16 slots , another x4 slot , and an M.2 slot . Instead of putting a CPU into a socket on the motherboard , fitting in RAM and adding in storage , Intel has gone with the NUC Compute Element . It houses all of those components , but slides into a PCIe x16 slot and runs off an additional 8-pin power connection , very much like a graphics card . The unit found in the NUC 9 Extreme has two SO-DIMM slots , two M.2 ports , and can run reportedly run a Intel Core i5-9300H , Core i7-9750H , or Core i9-9980HK . What Intel has effectively done with this design is find a way to take one half of the motherboard and convert it into a swappable component . Just as you can take a graphics card out of a PCIe slot and fit in a new one to boost the capabilities of your computer , you could take out a NUC Compute Element and slot in a new one to give the NUC 9 Extreme a boost . Of course , you may have re-install Windows . Since Intel CPU upgrades often require new motherboards , the transition to NUC Compute Element could end up being less wasteful , as it would let some of the traditional elements of the motherboard stick around between upgrades . It could also making picking PC components a little less daunting for newer PC builders .

Intel may have moved onto 10nm process nodes for its Ice Lake processors ( CPUs ) , but it looks like 14nm is still where its focus is for desktop . And , it may not be such a bad thing , as a recent leak has shown what could be a new Intel Core i5 CPU with 6 cores and 12 threads using the new Comet Lake-S architecture , HotHardware reports . The leak shows an Intel CPU tested on an H400-series motherboard , one we understand to be designed for desktop Comet Lake-S processors using the LGA 1200 socket . Beyond the chip 's 6 cores and 12 threads , it 's shown having a base clock speed of 2.0GHz and a total of 12MB of L3 cache and 3MB of L2 cache . Currently , Intel has already introduced 10nm Ice Lake CPUs and 14nm Comet Lake CPUs for mobile devices , but we have n't seen desktop versions of these CPUs show up yet . And , while it 's unfortunate that we 're seeing yet another 14nm chip for desktop , Intel appears to be upping the ante to better challenge AMD this time . AMD 's big push at the introduction of Ryzen , and now with Ryzen 3000 , has been dazzling core counts and multi-threading to boost performance that much further . If Intel introduces a 6-core/12-thread Intel Core i5 , as this leak suggests , it could be better competition for AMD 's chips than past Core i5 processors , which lacked hyper-threading . The 2.0GHz clock speed may be a concern , but the leaked chip is likely an engineering sample that 's not running at the speeds production models will hit . Running at a higher speed could help it compete with something like the Ryzen 5 3500 , which also boasts 6 cores and runs at a 3.6GHz base clock speed ( though has a much heftier 32MB of L3 cache ) . When it comes to the top of the pack , though , we 're still waiting for the 10-core Comet Lake CPU spotted in earlier leaks .
It looks like Intel ’ s CPU shortages , which began back in 2018 , could continue well into 2020 , and if true , that could help its rival , AMD , further increase its processor market share . Nearly 14 months after Intel ’ s struggles to produce enough 14nm processors began , rumors are flying that the shortages will last at least one or two more quarters , taking us well into 2020 . The rumors have emerged from the Canalys Channels Forum event in Barcelona , Spain , where , as the Register reports , several partners of Intel have commented on the shortages . For example , Alex Cho , president of HP 's personal systems business , said about Intel ’ s supply issues and the impact it ’ s had on HP ’ s business , that “ it 's been a hard year , it makes life more complex and expect it to continue for another quarter or two . '' Ominously , Cho also hinted that Intel ’ s supply issues were did not affects “ just specific CPUs '' , but a range of products . Gianfranco Lanci , chief operating officer at Lenovo , was also at the event , and reportedly said that Intel ’ s chip constraints were a “ concern ” that had limited the potential growth of the PC market this year . According to Lanci , Lenovo has been told by Intel that supply would improve quarter-on-quarter , but that has yet to happen . He also suggested that the supply issues could be because of either production issues , or a `` problem with the architecture of the CPU . If this is the problem , it is unpredictable . '' AMD , which is suffering from no such shortages , has been on a roll recently , and now has the biggest slice of CPU market share in over a decade . If Intel continues to struggle to produce processors well into next year , then more people could start switching to AMD . Supply chain sources have told the Register that with Intel moving from the 10nm to 7nm process for creating new CPUs , it means there are less resources for making the 14nm CPUs – which are the ones experiencing the supply issues . Apparently , Intel is also prioritising supply for high-end Xeon chips for businesses – further compounding the supply issues for the more affordable 14nm processors . While this is frustrating for customers and system manufacturers that are having trouble sourcing Intel ’ s 14nm chips , it could also mean that Intel continues to lose market share to AMD . We 've contacted Intel for comment , and will update this story when we hear back .

Another day , another set of leaked benchmarks , and once again we ’ re seeing the power of AMD ’ s imminent Ryzen 9 3950X – this time in a comparison to Intel ’ s incoming Core i9-10980XE ( although this is not an apples-to-apples comparison in several different respects – more on that later ) . So , before we come to the caveats – the most obvious one being that we assume these benchmarks are genuine – let ’ s take a look at the actual 3DMark scores as provided by the ever-present CPU leaker TUM_APISAK . AMD Ryzen 9 3950X 16-Core - FIRE STRIKEPhysics Score 32XXXhttps : //t.co/budy9vfMiHOctober 19 , 2019 i9-10980XE - FIRE STRIKEhttps : //t.co/AS8DmMbEcZOctober 19 , 2019 As you can see , we ’ re looking at the AMD and Intel chips in 3DMark , Fire Strike , specifically the ‘ Physics ’ score which pertains to the processor – the other results can ’ t be compared because the benchmarked PCs had different other hardware components ( including , most tellingly , different graphics cards ) . So the Ryzen 9 3950X hit 32,082 easily outdoing Intel ’ s Core i9-10980XE which recorded a result of 25,838 . That ’ s a victory to the tune of 24 % for the Ryzen processor , with both CPUs running at their stock clock speeds . Of course , with these being pre-release chips , we don ’ t know if the Intel silicon might be an earlier engineering sample , maybe – and we shouldn ’ t put all that much emphasis on the importance of a sub-test from a single benchmark anyway . Remember that these chips are from different worlds , too : the Ryzen 9 3950X is a consumer flagship , and the Core i9-10980XE is the flagship of Intel ’ s incoming range of Cascade Lake-X high-end desktop processors . In other words , they are built for different purposes , with Intel ’ s Cascade Lake-X targeted at heavyweight computing usage and coming with other performance benefits as such ( like 48 PCIe lanes , and quad-channel memory ) . Nonetheless , this certainly illustrates just how the power of even Ryzen consumer processors has been ramped up , to the point where the flagship 3950X is outdoing an equivalent ( in terms of cores and base clocks ) current-gen Threadripper as we saw yesterday . Although of course , 3rd-gen Threadripper is around the corner , and that ’ s really where the battle will lie for Cascade Lake-X CPUs – and Intel ’ s anticipating a fierce fight , by the looks of things , given the massive price slashes we recently witnessed to the Core i9-10980XE and all the way down the range .

AMD has had one hell of a 2019 so far – at least when it comes to its processor business – with great reviews and stellar sales that have seen it gobble up more market share than it has done in over a decade . While it ’ s undoubtedly been thrilling to see AMD claw its way back out of obscurity and become a real force to be reckoned with in the CPU industry again , it feels like a few too many of us have been overly hasty in writing off Intel . Sure , AMD ’ s been on a hot streak right now , and you ’ d be crazy if you didn ’ t think that has caused some rather worried discussions over at Intel , but you ’ d also be equally loopy if you thought that Intel ’ s vast dominance over the CPU market would be under any serious threat… for now . What AMD ’ s recent successes has done is put every move Intel makes under the spotlight , leading people to question everything it does – and wonder whether or not it is in response to AMD ’ s resurgence . Take Intel ’ s recent price cuts for its Cascade Lake-X processors , and its budget Core i5-9400F CPU . Now , this could be framed as Intel getting spooked by AMD , and cutting its prices in response . Considering the new threat AMD now poses , that ’ s a theory that ’ s not without merit – but of course it doesn ’ t tell the whole story . First of all , making drastic price cuts to your products is not something a company – especially one as successful as Intel – does on a whim . This can take months of planning – if not longer – while taking into consideration all kinds of impacts the price cut will have . I ’ m not just talking about the impact to profits either – cutting prices on products can alter the perception customers have of them . Make a once premium product too cheap , and it can lose a lot of appeal – especially if it ’ s then competing against products from competing companies who have much more experience and success at producing budget products… like AMD . So , while it ’ s tempting to picture Intel cutting prices all over the place in a bid to halt AMD ’ s rise , it ’ s unlikely that ’ s what ’ s happening . A more generous reading of the situation – for Intel , at least – is that the company has finally decided to make its products more affordable – the perceived Intel premium , which leads to its products being more expensive than the competition , has often been criticized by customers . Cutting prices could also lead to bigger sales – after all , getting your products into the hands ( and PC cases ) of more people is always a good thing . Releasing more wallet-friendly devices could also be a nice PR win for Intel – though at the moment AMD seems to be stealing all the limelight . It ’ s also worth remembering that while AMD is certainly doing well with its new processors , Intel isn ’ t resting on its laurels – something the company has certainly been guilty of in the past . Instead , the company has some innovative and exciting new tech coming out . One of the best side effects of AMD ’ s recent successes seems to be Intel no longer taking its market lead for granted . Now , this could me doing exactly what I was cautioning against only a few paragraphs earlier – reading anti-AMD motives in Intel ’ s behaviour when none exist – but it certainly feels like Intel is coming up with some of its most exciting products in years . From consumer processors with huge core counts , to upcoming CPUs that look like they could be beasts when it comes to overclocking , there ’ s some great stuff coming out of Intel ’ s corner . Of course , there ’ s also the fact that it ’ s coming out with its own Intel Xe graphics card to compete with AMD and Nvidia – and we should be seeing it by mid-2020 . There ’ s also one area that Intel ’ s dominance remains unchallenged : laptop processors . Again , we have seen an increase in AMD-toting laptops recently – and Microsoft releasing a Surface Laptop 3 with an AMD variant was a huge coup for the company – but Intel easily remains king in this regard – not just in sheer number of products available , but in performance as well . And , while news of Microsoft no longer using Intel hardware exclusively in its Surface devices got a lot of people excited , it ’ s worth remembering that Microsoft is still releasing Surface devices with Intel CPUs . Those are the versions that will likely sell the most and ( this is me making a slightly controversial prediction before our full review of the products are finalised ) will perform better as well . We ’ ve also had time with a number of upcoming Project Athena laptops . These are devices from some of the largest manufacturers in the world who have worked closely with Intel to produce laptops that are incredibly powerful , and yet also offer hugely improved battery lives and always-on connectivity . From what I ’ ve seen of these laptops already , they could be real game changers . Intel has also made huge strides in improving the integrated graphics of its processors . I met up with Intel last week for its Open House event at the Science Museum in London , UK ( an absolutely brilliant choice of venue , by the way ) , and got to see first hand some very thin and light laptops running games at impressive visual quality and at high frame rates – all using the integrated graphics of Intel ’ s 10th generation Core processors . Again , this is seriously impressive – and exciting – innovations from Intel , and something I don ’ t see AMD matching any time soon . So , yes , AMD is doing amazingly well , and that is great to see . No one likes a monopoly . But don ’ t count out Intel just yet – the company has a lot of tricks up its sleeve to keep us consumers on its side – and in the end , that ’ s great news for us .

Intel could be preparing to launch its discrete graphics card , based on its Xe architecture and built using the 10nm process , by the middle of 2020 . This means that by the halfway point of next year , Nvidia and AMD , the two main players when it comes to discrete ( standalone ) GPUs will have to share the market with a new rival : Intel . The rumors of a mid-2020 launch for the Intel Xe graphics card come from industry sources , according to DigiTimes . Apparently , the sources have said that : “ Instead of purely targeting the gaming market , Intel is set to combine the new GPUs with its CPUs to create a competitive platform in a bid to pursuit business opportunities from datacenter , AI and machine learning applications . ” That means that Intel ’ s upcoming graphics card might not be aimed at gamers . The focus on AI and machine learning applications in particular could worry Nvidia , which has been investing heavily in those areas . So , PC gamers looking for a new GPU to run the latest games might be a bit disappointed . However , according to DigiTime ’ s sources , Intel is looking to increasing its profitability in the PC and datacenter markets , which also increasing its influence and reach in the AI and autonomous driving markets . While Intel is best known for making processors , along with integrated graphics ( which are included in the same chip as the processor ) , it has dabbled in making discrete GPUs before – but without success . It seems like the company is more determined to succeed this time , and has nabbed AMD ’ s former CTO of graphics , Raja Koduri . Intel has also created an R & D center in India to work on the 10nm Intel Xe GPU , which again according to DigiTimes will launch in 2020 , with a 7nm GPU , using Foveros 3D technology coming in 2021 . The rumours of an Intel Xe graphics card release date of mid-2020 corresponds with an earlier cryptic tweet by Koduri , which hinted at a June 2020 release .

Intel ’ s incoming Core i9-9900KS , a new top-end CPU which is expected to launch later in October , has apparently already been purchased by a Redditor and overclocked with impressive results – hitting 5.2GHz just on air ( in other words , with no fancy liquid cooling solution ) . As is usually the case with these sort of pre-release leaks , though , we have to be cautious about whether this could be fabricated – although the denizen of Reddit in question did post a ( purported ) picture of the retail box . Apparently the chip was mistakenly listed – and errantly sold – by a retailer in the Czech Republic . The Redditor admits to being a “ total OC [ overclocking ] noob ” , and using just air cooling – a Noctua NH D15 – overclocked the CPU to 5.2GHz over all cores with the voltage set to 1.36V , while benchmarking in Cinebench R20 . Assuming this is genuine , it seems to be an impressive indicator of the overclocking potential of the Core i9-9900KS . Even if the actual Cinebench result achieved is n't totally mind-blowing . The chip recorded a result of 5,356 , and as Tom ’ s Hardware notes , a stock 9900K hit 4,984 . So the overclocked 9900KS is just over 7 % faster in this comparison . Although an overclocked 9900K at 5GHz scores 5,266 , so the gain is only 1.7 % in this case . That said , this is only one benchmark – and not a gaming one , which is where the real interest will be – and of course the 9900KS may well have a good deal more potential to be pushed further considering this result was obtained by a self-confessed newbie with a simple air cooler . It ’ s also worth noting that the purported 9900KS was only paired with the ‘ cheapest DDR4 RAM ’ ( 2666MHz ) the Redditor could find . The Redditor also observed : “ Very good chip indeed . In a Prime95 small FFTs 16 thread test it managed to stay at ~5020MHz for the whole test which I terminated after 20 minutes . Cooled with NH-D15 , it reached max temperature 83°C and average temperature 75°C in the test . I did n't touch BIOS settings yet , so these are all out of the box results . ” And in GTA Online , Intel ’ s Core i9-9900KS ran itself at 5,010MHz and “ stayed there rock solid ” , with a CPU load hovering around 15 % and temperature at 57°C . Intel has already been busy pointing out that the CPU is capable of reaching the promised 5GHz boost across all eight-cores , and drawing comparisons to AMD ’ s recent controversy over boost clocks not reaching advertised levels . And that small anecdotal test ( again , assuming all this is true ) appears to bear this out… The Core i9-9900KS is essentially a heavily binned version of the 9900K , meaning Intel has simply reserved the best versions of this chip which are capable of reaching 5GHz across all cores ( the vanilla Core i9-9900K can only achieve that feat on a single core ) . So effectively you are paying for one of the top 9900K chips , although even then , within the 9900KS range there will still be variances in tolerances for overclocking , and CPUs which can be pushed further than others . Another point to note here is that if retailers actually have stock of the Core i9-9900KS , it hopefully won ’ t be long before these processors are officially on sale . As mentioned , Intel has said the chips will launch in October , so we could be looking at next week .

AMD 's Ryzen 3000 processors are champions of the desktop space right now , and that 's leaving Intel in a tough spot . Despite rumors that Intel might try to catch up by skipping straight to desktop processors ( CPUs ) using 7-nanometer ( nm ) architecture , the company still has plans to bring its 10nm architecture to desktop devices , according to PC Gamer . From the Ryzen 5 3600 at the bottom of the stack to the Ryzen 9 3900X at the top ( at least as far as commercially available options ) , AMD 's CPU offerings with its 7nm architecture are amazing blends of performance and price . And , that value has let AMD eat up Intel 's market share . That sudden shift in power dynamics in the market offered some feasibility to the rumor Intel would skip 10nm architecture for desktops in order to focus on a 7nm design that would compete directly with AMD . So far , Intel has released processors built on its 10nm Ice Lake architecture in mobile devices , but we have n't seen desktop versions available to consumers . And , a leak from HardwareLUXX had suggested Intel was n't satisfied with the speeds achieved by Ice Lake , and would therefore focus on 7nm for desktop processors instead . That rumor had previously been refuted by Intel to Tom 's Hardware , but without clarity on just what Intel would release . Since then , PC Gamer learned from a source that Intel still fully planned to release standalone desktop CPUs . At a glance , it might seem like Intel skipping 10nm to focus on its 7nm architecture would make sense . After all , AMD is already there and thriving . But , processor architectures are n't all created equal . Intel has stressed that its 10nm process node is comparable to 7nm nodes designed by other foundries . Though , we 'll really have to wait and see , since AMD 's 7nm desktop processors do n't go head to head with Intel 's current , 10nm mobile processors . Still , Intel 's 7nm architecture should be a further improvement on that , assuming Intel does n't run into some of the speed issues Ryzen 3000 CPUs have encountered . This battle is only going to heat up ( though the processors themselves may get cooler and cooler ) , as Intel 's 7nm chip are n't coming until 2021 while AMD may be moving onto an enhanced 7nm+ Zen 3 architecture in 2020

Intel has a strategy to fight back against AMD , and rumor has it that the chip giant ’ s tactics will be pretty simple – it intends to throw money at pushing Core and Xeon processors , and a ton of it : $ 3 billion ( around £2.4 billion , AU $ 4.4 billion ) , the speculation suggests . We should heavily underline that it ’ s one of the sketchier entries in the rumor category , coming from AdoredTV , who was apparently emailed a leaked slide from a recent Intel sales meeting . It 's clear that Intel is under great pressure from AMD on the processor front – losing heavily to Ryzen 3000 in the desktop arena , and worse still , facing a threat from Epyc in data center territory – and the leaked slide holds that Intel ’ s advantage is “ financial horsepower ” . Specifically , the slide claims Intel has a ‘ 2019 Meet Comp Discount ’ ( the amount of money it 's able to spend to disrupt competition ) of $ 3 billion , which is 10 times the net profit AMD made in 2018 . Of course , we have to tread very carefully here because that slide could be faked , but it isn ’ t a massive leap to imagine that Intel has a raft of further price-cutting measures that it can use to fight AMD , given that we ’ ve already seen some evidence of this . Intel recently revealed massive price cuts to incoming Xeon W CPUs ( for servers ) and Cascade Lake-X processors ( powerful chips for enthusiasts and high-end desktops ) . At the other end of the scale , certain popular budget processors from Intel have also just had a ( much smaller-scale ) price cut . So are we about to see further cuts being made left , right and center , and maybe even far more competitive pricing for Intel ’ s next-gen Comet Lake processors for desktops ( which are being powered up with hyper-threading , even at the low-end ) ? Possibly so , but what ’ s ruffling feathers here is that Intel is directing its coffers into simply outmuscling AMD financially , rather than putting these wedges of cash into research to actually power-up its processors and make them more competitive chips with the likes of Ryzen and Epyc . Of course , the latter would take time and entails a whole different world of complexity , whereas throwing money at the problem is an immediate and ( relatively ) simple solution… As AdoredTV points out in his video , Intel has massively deep pockets , and it could easily afford far more than $ 3 billion to shore up its CPU sales , if that ’ s what was required ( last year Intel made a profit to the tune of $ 21 billion – around £17 billion , AU $ 31 billion ) . However , even if it makes sense in some respects , we have to treat this rumor with extreme caution , because as we ’ ve already noted , there ’ s no telling whether that slide is genuine or not . Intel may be looking to combine the effect of price cuts – which it is definitely making in some measure , as we ’ ve mentioned – with any strain on stock that AMD may experience , because the latter is another potentially key factor in how the CPU wars will play out . We ’ ve already seen Ryzen chips struggling to meet demand at the high-end , and with rumors flying around of 7nm shortages – issues compounded by the popularity of the iPhone 11 – Intel may be hoping to land a telling double blow on pricing and supply here . Although ultimately , at least in the short-term , downward pressure on the prices of CPUs will be no bad thing for consumers , of course . The long-term competitiveness of the processor market might be another matter , though , if AMD begins to get outmuscled in this kind of fashion . Via Wccftech

Intel recently cut prices with certain budget CPUs , and as it looks to strike back against AMD ’ s recent successes in the desktop processor market , it would appear the plan is to seriously pep up its incoming 10th-gen lower-end Core i3 chips . At least this is the latest word from prolific leaker TUM_APISAK , who spotted a SiSoftware benchmark for the incoming Intel Core i3-10100 . Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) i3-10100 CPU @ 3.60GHz ( 4C 8T 3.6GHz , 4x 256kB L2 , 6MB L3 ) Intel CometLake Client Platform CannonLake Client System ( Intel CometLake S UDIMM ( ERB/CRB ) ) https : //t.co/qTQRCnf2dP pic.twitter.com/LYpo40qVw3October 11 , 2019 As you can see above , the processor runs at 3.6GHz , but more importantly , it ’ s a quad-core , eight-thread model – at least if this leak is correct and the benchmark isn ’ t somehow fabricated . Intel ’ s 9th-gen Core i3 is a quad-core model with four-threads , so what we are ( allegedly ) seeing with the next-gen is the introduction of hyper-threading to Core i3 . Incidentally , the Core i3-9100 also runs at a base clock of 3.6GHz , but it ’ s possible the Core i3-10100 spotted in the benchmark is an early engineering sample , and it ’ ll likely be clocked a bit faster with the production chips . Given hyper-threading in Core i3 , it seems an obvious assumption that it will be present throughout the full range of Intel ’ s next-gen Comet Lake processors ( which are still on 14nm , of course , with yet another refinement of that process ) . Previous speculation has pointed to quad-core eight-thread Core i3 models with Comet Lake , alongside Core i5 chips running with six-cores and 12-threads , Core i7 with eight-cores and 16-threads , and Core i9 topping off at 10-cores plus 20-threads ( the latter being previously rumored as a Ryzen 9 3900X beater with single-core Turbo up to 5.2GHz ) . With current 9th-generation chips , only the Core i9 processors have hyper-threading ( meaning the rest of the range has the same number of threads as cores ) . Hyper-threading is what Intel calls simultaneous multi-threading , meaning the actual physical cores of the CPU can be split into virtual ones – threads – which can really help with heavy duty multitasking and certain apps . Comet Lake chips are expected to emerge in early 2020 , although before that – in fact later this month – we will see the launch of the new Core i9-9900KS at the high-end of Intel ’ s current CPU line-up ( a chip capable of reaching 5GHz across all eight cores ) .

More evidence of AMD ’ s incredible winning streak has emerged , with new data suggesting it now has over 30 % of the CPU market – its best ever result in 12 years . According to data collected by CPUBenchmark.net , AMD ’ s been slowly taking market share away from Intel , which had previously enjoyed a nearly unassailable lead in the CPU market . While the gap is still huge , you can see in the graph below that AMD ’ s rise is mirrored by a fall in Intel market share . As Wccftech points out , this follows an incredible 70 % growth for AMD since it launched its Ryzen line of processors back in 2017 . Since then , AMD , traditionally the underdog in the processor war , has seen continued growth with excellent sales and positive critical reception for its latest products – and this could be cause for concern for its old rival Intel . Cpubenchmark.net , as the name suggests , is a website run by PassMark which collects data based on its benchmark tests . This means it gets a pretty good idea of what kind of CPUs people are using – as long as they run those benchmarks . It therefore only tracks CPUs in use , not ones sold .

If AMD continues to eat up CPU market share , Intel will definitely have a fight on its hands . It ’ s already cut the price of some of its processors in response to AMD ’ s stellar performance . The CPU wars could soon get very interesting .

Intel is a leading force when it comes to esports in the UK , offering some of the best computing hardware on the market and throwing its weight behind esport tournaments , such as ESL One and Intel Extreme Masters . However , the company is now looking to invest in the future of the industry and , in particular , university student esport talent . Earlier this year , Intel announced its sponsorship of the National Student Esports ( NSE ) , the official body of university esports in the UK . You may not have heard of the NSE , but it 's essentially the body fighting for university esports players to be taken seriously by the education system – an often difficult and frustrating task for those involved . Following news of the sponsorship , and the newly announced initiative between Intel , ESL and NSE , we sat down with those involved to discuss the competitive world of university esports and why students could be its future . The NSE is still a fledgling body , officially founded in 2018 . Working with British University and Colleges Sport , the NSE aims to educate and advise universities on esports – helping them create a more hospitable environment for students interested in the industry . A large part of this is the NSE 's British University Esports Championship , which sees 498 university teams battling to be crowned 'Esports University of the Year ' and earn the recognition they deserve as a legitimate university team – as well as a chunky trophy for the cabinet . It 's no easy feat . Unsurprisingly , esports is n't exactly viewed in the same vein as soccer or rugby , with students often fighting for dedicated gaming spaces or to be recognized as an official university team . `` What you find working in the higher education esports space , is that the level of understanding between different institutions can differ quite dramatically , '' NSE executive director Jon Tilbury tells us . `` The university that is running a games course is going to have an understanding of the games industry . So what we did was to make sure that the system is open as possible . Any group of five players from the same university , provided that they can verify that they are students of that University , are able to enter the competition . '' `` What you find working in the higher education esports space , is that the level of understanding between different institutions can differ quite dramatically '' So , what if you want to join the NSE 's championship ? Well , firstly , do n't worry if your university is n't exactly being a supportive 'showmom ' , entering does n't require membership fee from either the students or the university . There 's also a wide range of games that your team can take part in including the likes of League of Legends and Overwatch . Students earn points depending on where they place in individual competitions , these then translate to points for an overall Olympic medal-type table for all the universities . The aim is to garner a level of respect for these students and esports as a whole – proving this is n't just a hobby but something that could actually become a career . `` We have students that have developed matchmaking platforms and programs for them to use at their society LAN game event , '' Tilbury explains . `` There are students that have written algorithms to analyze match data that we make available , and then turn that into content that thousands of other students have been engaged with . `` In university sport we see a lot of clubs and teams using those professional skills , using sport as a way of developing those soft skills , to make them a more valuable employee in the future . But in esports we 're seeing that from a more focused perspective . '' And , that 's where Intel comes in . Intel has officially become a sponsor of NSE earlier this year – giving the body a much-needed boost in both external support and adding a level of recognition that encourages internal university support . While having the backing of Intel in name is certainly a positive , the computing company equally sees the promise in encouraging new esports talent within the UK . `` A company like Intel getting behind it and supporting the growth of grassroots esports at a university level is important and should be taken seriously , '' Scott Gillingham , Intel 's UK gaming and esports lead , tells us . `` This is where I see an opportunity to bring in our expertise and then help the industry growing in the UK . With the NSE , it 's not just specifically about esports players ; it 's all about the opportunities that are around esports . `` Esports is n't just about the gamer . What [ the NSE ] is doing is helping build a pipeline of talent for the UK esports industry . Intel coming on board and sponsoring this helps validate the importance and growth of esports and this is something to be looked at and taken seriously , but also helping those universities . '' The first major push for this is in Intel 's new FutureGen initiative in partnership with NSE and ESL – a program which aims to identify esports talent among students at UK universities . The program will offer successful applicants experience in esports , letting them have `` hands on experience '' with NSE and Intel development events before finishing the process with an ESL esport event – like esport work experience heaven . It 's all well and good , these bodies and companies telling us how much they 're helping students . But , we wanted to talk to someone who is directly affected by the Intel sponsorship to see if , on the ground level , this push is actually paying off . Enter Mark , a University of Nottingham economics student and avid League of Legends player . Much like any student , Mark played League for fun with friends before going to university and deciding he wanted to kick things up a notch by playing competitively – making a team between seven friends and eventually joined the NSE tournament . `` I 'd say on the whole it 's been a positive experience , '' Mark tells us . `` It 's not that we 're not taken seriously , I think it 's generally a lack of understanding . There 's been a notable difference since the NSE started in . It made people more open to it . If we want to reach out and ask how do we explain to our university or if we 're putting on an event , whether they can help us . The reply is always : 'Yes , we 'll do out utmost to really help you out ' . The NSE is really great in that way . '' `` Previously , maybe five or 10 years ago if you said you spend your time playing computer games , it would have been seen as a waste of time . Now , I can say I 've helped build this community and put on these events and the perceptions has changed . I wo n't say stigma , but the stereotype about what gaming and esports is has changed . '' If you want to apply for Intel 's FutureGen initiative then you can apply now . Applications will be open to all students studying full-time at UK universities , but not restricted to those playing in NSE . Welcome to TechRadar 's PC Gaming Week 2019 .

Remember Intel Kaby Lake-G ? It was Intel 's line of laptop processors that paired Kaby Lake silicon with AMD Vega graphics for gaming laptops . And , well , it 's been discontinued . This all comes via a Product Change Notice , spotted by our friends at Tom 's Hardware . These processors were the product of an unholy union of Intel and AMD , and according to the report `` Market demand for the products listed in the `` Products Affected/Intel Ordering Codes '' table below have shifted to other Intel products . '' Intel is on the cusp of releasing its own dedicated graphics architecture for both consumers and enterprise , so it 's not surprising that Intel would axe these processors . Do n't forget about Intel Ice Lake either . Intel 's 10th-generation `` Project Athena '' processors for Ultrabooks are packing the latest Gen11 graphics , which should be capable of powering some light gaming workloads . Even if they 're really designed to allow the laptops to run Photoshop and other similar apps somewhat efficiently . This might also indicate when we can expect a followup to this team-up platform . Intel G-series processors will be discontinued after January 31 , 2020 , and while we do n't think Intel will team up with AMD again – especially now that Intel Xe is a thing – we might see some H-series processors with Intel Gen11 graphics . Intel is really trying to push its integrated graphics as discrete-class . Either way , you probably wo n't find many gaming laptops with these Intel G-series processors in them after January – not that there were many to begin with . As for what Intel will replace them with , we 'll just have to wait and see what Intel has in store .
We ’ ve seen Intel respond to AMD ’ s highly competitive high-end desktop chips recently with pricing truly slashed on Cascade Lake-X processors , but there ’ s also been a response in the budget arena , with Intel dropping the prices of its 9th-generation F and KF-Series chips . That includes the popular Core i5-9400F which is a tempting choice to build a budget gaming PC around , being a nicely affordable CPU with six-cores ( six-threads ) capable of turbo to 4.1GHz . It drops the inclusion of integrated graphics – or rather disables the iGPU , which obviously isn ’ t a problem if you have a discrete graphics card anyway – and is thus sold a bit more cheaply than the standard i5-9400 by retailers . And it should become even cheaper , now , with Intel dropping the recommended price in the US from $ 182 to $ 157 . Online pricing is already less than Intel ’ s recommendation , and generally pitched around the $ 140 to $ 150 mark in the US ( and about the same in UK pounds ) – so hopefully we will see the results of this 14 % price cut filter through to online retailers in short order , making the Core i5-9400F even more tempting . And indeed boosting its appeal in the face of budget CPU challengers from AMD , namely the AMD Ryzen 5 3500X and 3500 which are allegedly set to be released imminently . Of course , as we mentioned at the outset , the price cuts apply not just to this popular model , but to all 9th-Generation F and KF-Series processors – F-Series meaning there are no integrated graphics , and KF being the same deal except these processors are unlocked ( so they can be overclocked ) . At the top-end , this means that Intel ’ s Core i9-9900KF 8-core CPU capable of 5GHz boost will be reduced slightly from a recommended price of $ 488 to $ 463 , a somewhat less impressive discount – but still something . Want to see all the relevant 9th-gen CPUs in a handy-dandy table ? Oh , go on then – the following list shows the chips in question with their old price , followed by the new ( obviously reduced ) price : Theoretically ( and stingily ) , Intel never applied a discount to these CPUs which ditch integrated graphics , but retailers have done so . These chips weren ’ t designed to be a value proposition , but rather to help Intel deal with stock shortages , by making use of chips which would otherwise have been binned ( and we mean literally binned ) due to having faulty integrated GPUs . By disabling the GPU , Intel can then sell these processors , which work otherwise identically to the functional GPU models . However , these chips have proved popular enough – or indeed perhaps needed enough – to be adopted into Intel ’ s long-term strategy , because as Tom ’ s Hardware reports , the plan is to produce F-Series processors going forward . So we will see these products with 10th-gen desktop CPUs which are set to be released next year .
Editor 's note : Intel has reached out and clarified that the Gen12 and Xe graphics referred to in this presentation were mistranslated . The speaker at the IDC event did n't mention ray tracing or refer to the Xe graphics in Tiger lake as 'Gen 12 ' . This was all due to a mistranslation , thanks to Google Translate . The original story continues below ... Intel has revealed more about its incoming Gen12 graphics , which by all accounts will mean you ’ ll be able to play contemporary esports games like Fortnite at a fluid 60 frames per second ( in Full HD resolution ) on gaming laptops with an integrated GPU . These revelations come from the Intel Developer Conference ( IDC ) over in Tokyo , where the chip giant had plenty to say about the Gen12 graphics which will be incorporated with its Tiger Lake laptop processors ( the successor to current Ice Lake chips ) and Xe discrete GPUs , both of which are expected to arrive next year . Ice Lake ( which is already around in new notebooks , like Microsoft ’ s freshly revealed Surface Pro 7 ) runs with Gen11 ( Iris Plus Graphics ) and Intel ’ s slides at IDC showed its performance is an impressive boost over previous-gen UHD 620 integrated graphics . Gen11 allows a game such as Rocket League to run at close to 60 fps , but the likes of Fortnite or Dirt Rally 2.0 are more like 40 to 45 fps ( still playable , but it ’ s that 60 fps threshold which is widely regarded as smooth gaming ) . And according to Intel ’ s presentation info , Tiger Lake ’ s integrated Gen12 graphics make that jump to 60 fps at 1080p resolution . Kenichiro Yasu , director of Intel technology headquarters , asserted that Gen12 offers double the performance compared to Gen11 , and that Intel is firmly targeting 60 fps . So that ’ s obviously great news for those who can ’ t afford a fully-fledged gaming laptop with a discrete GPU , and rely on integrated graphics , yet still want to play some midrange games with a good deal of fluidity ( and maybe even manage some more demanding titles with the details turned down at a solid enough frame-rate ) . As mentioned , these Tiger Lake chips should be out in 2020 , and the company also again reaffirmed that standalone Intel Xe graphics cards will also be launching next year . In terms of the latter , an Intel exec recently hinted on Twitter that Xe graphics cards are scheduled to arrive in June 2020 ( although it was a rather cryptic tweet – although Intel has something of a history of these ) . Of course , even if that is Intel ’ s intention for a planned launch date , things might yet slip… Via Wccftech

AMD ’ s Ryzen 9 3950X lands in November ( after it was delayed ) , but beforeit hits the street some interesting fresh details have been spilled on the CPU and its overclocking potential . This comes from hardware vendor Gigabyte which made an overclocking guide for its Aorus X570 available online , detailing the firm ’ s results when juicing up the Ryzen 3rd-gen processor . We already knew that the 3950X boosts up to 4.7GHz – or at least that ’ s the official word from AMD – but that ’ s over two cores , Gigabyte notes in the documentation ( and potentially the wrong – ie not active – cores , another bugbear with Ryzen 3000 CPUs which has been highlighted recently ) . So how fast can the incoming flagship chip be pushed over all its 16-cores with overclocking ? As fast as 4.3GHz , it would seem , given Gigabyte ’ s setup which utilized an EK-KIT P360 water-cooling solution and the Aorus X570 Master motherboard . That ’ s a good chunk faster than the base clock speed of 3.5GHz , of course . The firm found the 3950X reached a stable 4.3GHz using around 1.4V , and the overclock meant an increase in Cinebench R15 multi-threaded from 3,932 at stock to 4,384 overclocked , an 11 % boost . Not too shabby , indeed . Gigabyte further observed that the temperatures witnessed during the overclocking session were “ similar [ to ] what we were getting last year using a Ryzen 7 2700X ” . So for this 16-core behemoth to be pushed across all its many cores and be performing in similar thermal terms to a 2nd-gen 8-core model is , well , quite impressive . Also remember that the Ryzen 9 3900X recorded a Cinebench R15 result of 3,097 when we reviewed the chip , so that makes the incoming flagship something like 27 % faster at stock speeds . Even more telling is the comparison between the 3950X and an Intel Core i9-9900K , with the latter hitting 1,873 – so AMD ’ s chip is more than twice as fast . Of course , this is only one benchmark , and as such hardly the whole performance picture – but still , it would seem that things are shaping up very nicely for the Ryzen 9 3950X , and it could help to hammer home the big gap AMD continues to open up in sales over Intel ( at least in the desktop market ) . Although how easy it will be to buy one of the things may be another matter entirely , so let ’ s hope the launch delay is about suitably ensuring demand doesn ’ t once again completely outstrip supply ( as with the 3900X ) .

Intel has taken the wraps off its new heavyweight Intel Xeon W CPUs and Cascade Lake-X processors . Although most of the details about the latter were already spilled last week following a leak , the news still represents a huge boost for the chip giant . The chip giant boasted that these new high-end desktop ( HEDT ) processors have been driven forward on the AI acceleration front courtesy of Intel Deep Learning Boost , which gives users an AI inference boost of 2.2x compared to the previous generation . Intel also noted that these processors benefit from Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 which has been “ further enhanced ” to help beefy applications ( such as simulation or modeling ) run faster by more accurately prioritizing the fastest cores to take on the work at hand . As mentioned , we ’ ve already seen all the details on the new 10th-gen Cascade Lake-X CPUs which have had their prices heavily slashed by Intel . The 18-core flagship Core i9-10980XE is set to retail at $ 979 ( around £795 , AU $ 1,450 ) compared to $ 1,979 ( around £1,600 , AU $ 2,920 ) for the previous-gen Core i9-9980XE . The huge price drops continue down the range to the tune of 40 % to 50 % , with the base Core i9-10900X starting at only $ 590 ( around £480 , AU $ 870 ) . Core counts are the same for Cascade Lake-X compared to predecessor Skylake-X , but with the new processors , you ’ re getting a bump in single-core turbo boosts , with these chips capable of hitting 4.8GHz maximum Turbo ( or 4.7GHz in the case of the 10900X ) . For the full details on these Cascade Lake-X offerings , check out our previous story on the launch – they are coming in November , incidentally , or at least that ’ s the plan . And that ’ s when the new Xeon chips will be available , too , so let ’ s move on to take a look at them . Intel ’ s new Xeon W-2200 chips are targeted at pro-level creators and the likes of heavyweight rendering or CAD and indeed AI development . There are eight processors in total , with the flagship Xeon W-2295 sporting 18-cores ( 36-threads ) with a base clock speed of 3.0GHz , all-core Turbo to 3.8GHz , and a maximum boost speed of 4.8GHz . This is with a TDP of 165W , and recommended pricing is $ 1,333 ( around £1,080 , AU $ 1,970 ) . The next step down is the W-2275 with 14-cores and a base clock of 3.3GHz , all-core turbo to 4.1GHz , and the same 4.8GHz max boost as the flagship . The price for this chip is $ 1,112 ( around £900 , AU $ 1,640 ) . That ’ s followed by the W-2265 , Intel ’ s 12-core Xeon offering which ups the base clock to 3.5GHz and all-core Turbo to 4.3GHz , again with the same max boost . The price in this case dips below the thousand mark at $ 944 ( around £765 , AU $ 1,390 ) . All these chips have a TDP of 165W . The range then runs down 10-core , 8-core and 6-core models , with a pair of quad-core ( 8-thread ) CPUs nestling at the bottom . The cheapest is the W-2223 clocked at 3.6GHz with all-core Turbo to 3.7GHz and a TDP of 120W , which is set to retail for $ 294 ( around £240 , AU $ 430 ) . You also get support for up to 72 PCIe lanes and 1TB of memory with these Xeon processors , as well as ECC support and Intel vPro on the security front . Intel notes that a 3D architectural rendering process run on Autodesk Revit with V-Ray is up to 10 % faster with the new flagship CPU compared to the previous-gen product . Again , prices on these new Xeon chips have been slashed to similar levels as seen with Cascade Lake-X , with the flagship model ’ s price tag pretty much being chopped in half . Naturally , this can only really be seen as a response to the threat posed by AMD as we ’ ve already discussed in recent times , with Intel ’ s rival making major headway with Ryzen 3000 CPUs in the consumer desktop PC arena – and the threat of 3rd-gen Threadripper products looming large ( AMD ’ s new HEDT offerings also arrive in November ) . As ever when these sort of price wars kick-off in the computer components world , the end-user is the winner…

We might start seeing Intel ’ s Xe graphics cards in the summer of 2020 . At least , that ’ s what Raja Koduri , Intel chief architect , was hinting at in his tweet on October 3 . The reigning processor ( CPU ) manufacturer is entering the discrete graphics cards market with its forthcoming Intel Xe cards , and for the first wave of these Xe graphics cards , it ’ s already committed to a 2020 schedule . Raja Koduri ’ s tweet , which Tom ’ s Hardware reported on , is a photo of what we ’ re assuming is the rear of his Tesla Model S bearing a custom license plate with the words ‘ THINKXE , ’ ‘ June ’ and 2020 ’ on it . And , it seems to confirm Intel ’ s target date . Intel is no stranger to cryptic messages such as this , having teased the Coffee Lake chips ’ release date with a coffee cup bearing the word ‘ October ’ and the numbers ‘ 10 ’ and ‘ 2017 ’ a couple of years back . Seeing as this photo came straight from the horse ’ s mouth , so to speak , we ’ re going to take it as gospel . However , whether or not it ’ s the date for the unveiling or the release itself , we have no idea . We ’ re betting on a release , but since Computex is a June affair , it might be that the manufacturer will announce it at the event and release it a few days later . Just when AMD has finally caught up to Nvidia in the graphics cards game , Intel is throwing its chips – or rather , graphics cards – in the pot , which could only mean good things for us . These Intel Xe graphics cards , which will be based on the Gen 12 graphics architecture , will come in two variants – one for consumers and the other for the data center . They will also be comprised of everything from entry-level mobile graphics to gaming GPUs to general purpose GPUs for exascale supercomputers . How Intel ’ s cards will measure up against their AMD and Nvidia rivals , we ’ ll have to wait and see . But , with Raja Koduri himself sharing weirdly specific , albeit enigmatic , information regarding the cards , we ’ re sure we ’ ll start seeing leaks churning through the rumor mill in the next few months leading up to June 2020 .

Over the last few months , we 've been hearing all kinds of rumors about Intel 's 10th-generation Cascade Lake-X processors . Now , Team Blue has finally lifted the veil – or at least part of it . Intel 's newest lineup of HEDT Core-X processors will be out sometime in November – with no more specific date set – and will start at just $ 590 ( about £480 , AU $ 880 ) for the Intel Core i9-10900X . That might sound like a lot , but considering that the Intel Core i9-9900X costs $ 989 ( £989 , AU $ 1,499 ) , that 's a pretty huge discount . It looks like the rumors were spot-on . Even at the high end , the Intel Core i9-10980XE , which is a 18-core , 32-thread processor , will just be $ 979 ( about £797 , AU $ 1,460 ) , compared to the $ 1,979 ( £1,899 , AU $ 3,049 ) Intel Core i9-9980XE . That 's more than half off the price . These lower prices do n't mean you 're getting less processing power either . While core counts remain the same across the lineup , single-core turbo boosts see a bump . It 's not the most sizable increase , just 200MHz for the Core i9-10980XE , but it will still result in faster performance . And , as a bonus , all of these Intel Cascade Lake-X processors will feature support for up to 256GB of DDR4 RAM , 72 PCIe lanes and Thunderbolt 3 support - something that has been painfully missing from desktop platforms for years now . We went ahead and listed all of the new processors down below , along with their all-core Turbo speeds , core counts and pricing : Unless you 're the type of person that needs to have the absolute most powerful system you can get so you can benchmark it for bragging rights on internet forums , or if you 're a creative professional that needs the power to render your projects , you probably do n't need an HEDT chip like this . However , Intel slashing the prices on its Core-X platform , which has always been out of reach for most consumers , is just another sign that competition is heating up in the desktop market . Even when the Intel Core i9-9980XE came out last year and showed the Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX who was boss , the 2990WX was saved by its lower pricing . It does n't look like Intel is willing to let that happen again . Now , we do n't know how these processors will perform in the real world , even if we have seen some leaked benchmarks for the Core i9-10920X , or how Threadripper 3rd Generation chips will stand up to them when they also launch in November . But , if Intel is cutting its prices to meet AMD on its turf , it wo n't be so easy to pick a side this time around . Plus , AMD Threadripper processors probably wo n't support Thunderbolt 3 , and for processors meant for professionals , that could very well be a dealbreaker . There is all kinds of information that we still do n't know about these processors , but we know enough to paint a good enough picture of what to expect from Cascade Lake-X . Now we just have to wait until we can get our hands on these pro-level processors to see what they 're capable of .
Intel is responding to the threat AMD poses in the high-end desktop processor world by implementing some massive price cuts with its soon-to-launch 10th Gen Cascade Lake-X CPUs , according to the rumor mill . And we mean really big price cuts , with a report from Videocardz – seemingly backed up by Intel slides published by Guru of 3D – claiming that the flagship Core i9-10980XE ( 18-core model ) will be priced at $ 979 ( around £800 , AU $ 1,465 ) , compared to an asking price of $ 1,979 ( around £1,620 , AU $ 2,960 ) for the previous generation Core i9-9980XE . There are similar cuts down the line , with the Core i9-10940X ( 14-core ) priced at $ 784 ( around £640 , AU $ 1,170 ) compared to $ 1,387 ( around £1,130 , AU $ 2,075 ) for its predecessor , and the Core i9-10920X ( 12-core ) being pitched at $ 689 ( around £560 , AU $ 1,030 ) versus $ 1,189 ( around £970 , AU $ 1,780 ) . Intel ’ s Core i9-10900X ( 10-core ) CPU will retail at $ 590 ( around £480 , AU $ 880 ) compared to $ 989 ( around £810 , AU $ 1,480 ) for the 9900X . Those cuts represent drops of around 40 % to 50 % , with the biggest reduction being chopping the cost of the flagship chip in half . Another way to look at it is that the previous Skylake-X products weigh in at $ 103 per core , and Cascade Lake-X will witness a reduction to $ 57 per core – much more competitive with AMD ’ s Ryzen Threadripper 2nd Generation ( current ) chips which are pitched at $ 55 per core . In fact , this would make Intel more than competitive with Threadripper , as Cascade Lake-X would offer an impressive level of price/performance in comparison to AMD ’ s existing 2nd Gen chips , and other benefits besides ( like 72 PCIe lanes versus 64 , and more memory capacity with Intel ’ s platform supporting up to 256GB , double the previous limit ) . These Intel processors will also be able to reach boost speeds of 4.8GHz – on one core , at any rate – or 4.7GHz for the 10900X . The trouble is that soon , Intel won ’ t be competing with those 2nd Gen AMD processors , but with a fresh batch of Threadripper 3rd Generation chips coming in November , led by a 24-core model and promising a dramatic performance boost with the switch to the Zen 2 architecture which has served Ryzen 3000 processors so well ( and driven them to new heights ) . Furthermore , earlier this week , we saw a leaked benchmark which shows that the Cascade Lake-X Core i9-10920X fails to best AMD ’ s Ryzen 9 3900X in Geekbench . And while that ’ s just a single benchmark which we have to regard with caution , as ever when it comes to these sort of leaks , it does point to difficult times ahead for Cascade Lake-X when Threadripper 3rd Gen emerges . Still , at least Intel ’ s pricing is looking much more competitive now , and as we ’ ve discussed elsewhere this morning , perhaps we ’ ll see similar downwards movement when it comes to the firm ’ s consumer processors to better compete with Ryzen 3000 . Via Wccftech
AMD ’ s Ryzen processors , driven by 3rd Generation sales , are reaching new heights in terms of units shifted , grabbing an unprecedented market share according to one retailer , and leaving Intel struggling badly in comparison . This is going by the latest statistics from German retailer Mindfactory ( as provided on a monthly basis by Reddit user Ingebor ) , which show that AMD secured 81 % of processor sales for September . Obviously that left Intel on 19 % . That ’ s an all-time high for Ryzen , and even better than Ryzen 3000 ’ s launch month when AMD hit a 79 % share ( it came close to returning to those levels last month , in August , with a 78 % result ) . You might think 78 % , 79 % , 81 % – it ’ s all much the same – and of course you ’ re not far wrong , but it ’ s still pretty telling that AMD ’ s share continues to creep up a few months after launch . We ’ re well past the hype and early sales stage now , so could this be an indication that an even greater erosion of Intel ’ s market presence is underway , at least in terms of the desktop and enthusiast buyers that Mindfactory represents ? Especially as AMD has new budget Ryzen 3000 processors which are reportedly about to be released… Also , we ’ ve seen a few tentative signs that some of AMD ’ s supply issues may be easing , and at least some stock of the difficult-to-find Ryzen 9 3900X is now available – Mindfactory now has five units at the time of writing , for example . And lastly , don ’ t forget , Black Friday is on the horizon , and that could mean even greater momentum for AMD sales for reasons we recently discussed… Of course , in the greater CPU market – which includes mobile chips for laptops , and also the army of business PCs out there – Intel still dominates . And we must be wary , as ever , of putting too much emphasis on the figures from a single retailer . AMD ’ s top-selling chip remains the Ryzen 5 3600 , which – for the first time – actually outsold Intel ’ s entire CPU range ( it has come close before , but never actually quite overtaken the latter ) . So , does Intel need to do something ? Take serious action ? You would think so , really , and the company will soon introduce the new flagship Core i9-9900KS with a much-touted 5GHz all-core Turbo , although it will be interesting to see how Intel balances a big push for performance with power requirements and heat management . At any rate , this is the high-end of the market , and what Intel really needs to look at is the middle ground – so could we see price cuts incoming to stop the rot in terms of ceding turf to the likes of the Ryzen 5 3600 ? Let ’ s keep our fingers crossed , because any move that makes for a more competitive CPU market is obviously a win for consumers . Via Wccftech

Intel has allegedly found a solution , or at least part of one , for its long-running supply issues with CPUs – which the firm admitted would be ongoing in a recent statement – and that solution is to enlist Samsung to help make more chips . This is according to Pulse News Korea ( as highlighted by Tech Powerup ) , and as ever with rumors , we need to tread with caution – although in the aforementioned statement , Intel did specifically state that “ we are increasing our use of foundries … to produce more Intel CPU products ” ( as well as Intel expanding its own manufacturing capacity ) . Rather than going to the likes of TSMC – which is used extensively by rival AMD , and apparently has little breathing room or capacity for taking on extra business right now – Intel has seemingly turned to Samsung ’ s fabs for help in making desktop processors , according to the report which cites the usual industry sources . Intel ’ s statement of last week , which apologized for the impact CPU shipment delays have had on PC manufacturers , appeared to pre-empt several complaints from major PC vendors that have emerged this week , including HP and Dell ( along with Asus previously ) . As Anandtech reports , Jeffrey Clarke , COO of Dell , delivered the following rather sharp statement : “ Intel CPU shortages have worsened quarter-over-quarter . The shortages are now impacting our commercial PC and premium consumer PC Q4 forecasted shipments . ” While we ’ ve been hearing a lot in recent times about how AMD is dominating with its new Ryzen 3000 processors in the desktop arena , Intel is still firmly in control when you look at the overall CPU market , which includes the large number of laptops and business PCs that are still Intel-powered in the majority . However , if Intel is letting the major OEMs down to the point where they are coming out and making statements like the one from Dell above , which definitely aren ’ t beating around the bush – that ’ s obviously a cause for concern . Particularly now this situation has gone on for so long , with Intel ’ s issues in failing to produce enough 14nm processors going way back to last year ( and all being tied in with the equally dire struggle to achieve viable yields in 10nm , in order to progress from 14nm ) . So this report has something of a ring of truth about it given the overall picture , and perhaps at this point , it ’ s unlikely Intel really cares how CPU production is upped – but just that it has to be ramped up , and quickly , before the confidence of big manufacturers really starts to ebb .

That 's a huge discount , as the processor launched with a $ 385 price tag but has seen plenty of price increases thanks to dwindling silicon supply from Intel . Intel Core i7-9700K : $ 409 now $ 299 at Best Buy The Intel Core i7-9700K is by far one of the best processors on the market today , with eight cores , eight threads and a boost clock of 4.9GHz . And , if you can get it for just $ 299 on Black Friday , you probably should . View Deal But , at least for Black Friday , the Intel Core i7-9700K should be much more affordable for anyone that wants some high-end mainstream power in their gaming PC . This processor was a bit controversial when it hit the streets , along with the rest of the Coffee Lake Refresh lineup , as it dropped hyperthreading – basically when each physical core is split into two virtual cores – the first time Intel did so for an Intel Core i7 processor . Instead , hyperthreading got included in the new Intel Core i9-9900K , a class of mainstream processors that did n't exist before Intel 's 9th generation . Still , the processor has no problem maintaining its spot in the hierarchy , giving the Ryzen 7 3700X some trouble in gaming , though it does lose when it comes to multi-threading workloads . Not surprising , given that the Ryzen chip has twice the threads , but whatever . Either way , at just $ 299 in this Black Friday PC gaming deal , the Intel Core i7-9700K might be the best processor deal we 'll see all Black Friday season . If you 're waiting to build a PC for Black Friday , you should probably jump on this Best Buy deal right now . TechRadar is scouring every retailer and rounding up all the top deals over the Black Friday period , and we ’ ve put all the best Black Friday deals and Cyber Monday deals in easy-to-navigate articles to help you find the bargains you ’ re looking for .
AMD ’ s Ryzen processors are totally dominating Intel chips in consumer desktop sales , at least by Amazon ’ s reckoning . If you look at Amazon.com ’ s ( US ) bestseller list of CPUs , no less than eight out of the top ten processors listed are AMD , with only a pair of Intel offerings present . And as Wccftech , which spotted this , notes , this has been the case for quite some time . The top dog chip is AMD ’ s Ryzen 7 2700X , in case you ’ re wondering ( more on that later ) . The retail giant ’ s bestseller list is updated hourly , and at the time of writing , stands pretty much exactly the same as Wccftech observed earlier ( and as remarked , has apparently been much like this for some time now ) . This isn ’ t really any shock , however , because since the launch of Ryzen 3000 , various sources have made AMD ’ s increasing dominance in the CPU world clear , and you ’ d struggle to find anyone who ’ d argue with you on this score . Although remember that looking at the broader processor arena , outside of desktop CPUs – so including OEM PCs and laptops , and business machines – Intel is still powering the majority of computers ( although even here , AMD is starting to gain serious ground – and in server CPUs as well , for that matter ) . All of which adds up to make a worrying picture for Intel , and to compound matters , supply issues are still plaguing the chip giant . Meaning Intel is kind of caught between a rock and a hard place at the moment – being pulled one way by the need to cut prices ( which it ’ s already doing with some processors ) to stay competitive with AMD ’ s technology , and being pulled another way by supply issues which would normally dictate that prices go up . As mentioned , the top-selling CPU is AMD ’ s Ryzen 7 2700X , which is somewhat surprising in that other sources we ’ ve seen have indicated the most popular chip is the Ryzen 5 3600 . In Amazon ’ s rankings , the Ryzen 5 3600 is in third , behind its predecessor the Ryzen 5 2600 – so yes , Ryzen 2nd-gen processors hold the top two spots here . That ’ s doubtless due to the knock-on effect of price-cutting which Ryzen 3000 ’ s release has caused for these older CPUs . For example , currently the 2600 is 40 % cheaper than the 3600 – and the former is still a great processor ( Black Friday could well usher in some even more tempting discounts , too ) . Where does Intel come in the top 10 ? Well , it actually holds fourth position after those three AMD chips , with the most popular Intel model being the Core i5-9600K . The Core i9-9900K is in sixth place , and sandwiched between those two Intel chips is AMD ’ s Ryzen 7 3700X .

According to sources familiar with the matter , Intel is reportedly looking for buyers for its connected home division which produces chips used in home internet access gear . The chipmaker has even gone as far as to hire a financial adviser to help with the deal as the firm looks to sell off the unit responsible for bringing in annual sales of around $ 450m . Intel 's connected home business manufacturers the semiconductors required to provide wireless connections in home routers and gateways . The division offers a range of chips that allow consumers to manage data traffic and connect to WiFi but it has struggled to compete against its larger rivals , Broadcom and Qualcomm . Intel 's CEO Bob Swan has been taking a closer look at the company 's operations and has said that he will explore options for areas that are not competitive . For instance , the chipmaker sold off its smartphone modem business to Apple for $ 1bn back in July and Swan has indicated that its memory business is another area where he may look for a partnership . As smart devices became more ubiquitous , Intel created its connected home initiative to ensure that its computing chips found their way into this new range of devices . Throughout its history , the company has often created new units as a way to help further its CPU business . We 'll likely hear more about Intel 's connected home business once it has some potential buyers lined up for the unit . Via Bloomberg

Intel seems to be building its own version of the DualShock 4 controller that may harness the powers of cloud gaming . According to a design patent filed by Intel Corporation and published by United States Patent Office ( via LetsGoDigital ) , the company is working on a `` game controller having a game controller touchpad '' . The designs attached show a controller very similar to Sony 's DualShock 4 controller , with symmetrical sticks , a D-pad on the left , four buttons on the right , a button in the middle and two more on either side of the a touch pad at the top of its face . There are also trigger buttons at the top as well as a micro USB port . The controller looks very similar to the DualShock 4 , but it does seems to be a bit chunkier than Sony 's offering , with a few more buttons at the bottom . There 's also likely to be one major difference : cloud gaming capabilities . This is n't the first time Intel has released a controller ; the company launched the Universal Wireless controller to accompany the failed On Live cloud gaming service back in 2011 , and it seems to have cloud gaming in its sights again this time . Intel is currently involved in both Google Stadia and parent company Tencent 's new cloud gaming service Start . With its fingers in so many cloud gaming pies , it would make sense for Intel to release its own cloud gaming controller for all these services . The controller patent was registered in China first , suggesting it is ( or was ) intended for the mass Chinese market where Tencent focuses its operations . It was then registered in the US last year , suggesting the company may be looking to release the controller for other cloud gaming services it has ties with . This is all speculation so far , but it seems that Intel is dipping a toe into the game pad market again . TechRadar has contacted the company for comment .
The news that Intel and MediaTek are working together on 5G modem technology raised a few eyebrows , but the partnership makes perfects sense when consider the potential threat to Intel ’ s PC business . The two companies are working on the development of modems for ‘ always-connected ’ PCs , a new category of device with integrated cellular connectivity . ‘ Always Connected ’ PCs are pitched as a way of driving productivity by providing Internet access at any location , and as a way of improving security of flexible workers by eliminating the need to use public Wi-Fi . As part of the project , Intel will define the specifications for the 5G chip , with MediaTek responsible for the development and manufacturing . Intel will also provide the optimisation and validation for the entire platform as well as system integration and co-engineering support for its OEM partners . These will include Dell and HP , which could release laptops powered by the modems in 2021 . Market leader Qualcomm has already made significant moves in the market , hoping to extend its mobile dominance into a new , emerging market . Intel had hoped to create its own 5G modems , with development buoyed by the contract to supply chips for the first 5G iPhone in 2020 . However Intel struggled to meet Apple ’ s demand and missed several deadlines . Apple made up with Qualcomm and then acquired Intel ’ s smartphone modem business for $ 1 billion earlier this year . It ’ s unlikely that an iPhone will be powered by an Apple-made modem for several years . The reason – as Intel found out – is that the development of cellular modem technology is a difficult task that requires years of investment and expertise acquisition . Qualcomm has a significant advantage in that respect . Intel might have lost interest in the smartphone market , but still wants to ensure its PC customers can deliver new mobile experiences using its technology . Analysts believe Intel ’ s relationships with PC manufacturers will be key if it is to be a contender . “ Bringing the always-on mobile experience to notebooks will be a significant differentiator in what is going to be a heavily contested market between traditional notebook OEMs like Dell , and HP , mobile phone OEMs like Samsung , Huawei , and LG , and hybrid OEMs like Lenovo and Apple , ” explained Malik Saadi of ABI Research . “ This is yet another indication that the notebook value-chain and the mobile value chain are on the verge of converging to bring always-on broadband experiences on the move to new device types beyond smartphones . `` Intel could well benefit from this new development because of its outreach to traditional notebook OEMs and their distribution channels , their unrivalled experience in aligning compute performance with highly demanding notebook applications without compromising the device battery life , and their on-going partnerships with key mobile OEMs , including Lenovo , Huawei , and Samsung . ” The decision to partner with MediaTek might be surprising , but the Taiwanese company has made significant gains in the smartphone space thanks to strong traction in the mid-range segment . Working with Intel gives MediaTek another front on which to challenge Qualcomm , while the partners are undoubtedly stronger together than they are in isolation – even if the task ahead won ’ t be easy . “ Time to market , optimized and balanced performance and device battery life through highly integrated designs , as well as partnerships with key OEMs with large distribution channels will be the key factors [ Intel and Qualcomm ] will rely on to create large-scale deployments for their 5G notebook solutions , ” added Saadi .
If you ’ ve heard of MediaTek , it ’ s probably been in relation to a midrange smartphone like the Motorola One Maco or Oppo Reno Z ; but this Taiwanese chip-maker is everywhere ; or more specifically , everywhere there ’ s an Amazon Echo device… so , basically , everywhere . Not content with infiltrating homes around the world , MediaTek now has its sights set on 5G laptops and flagship 5G smartphones as 2019 draws to a close . Kicking off with laptops and MediaTek is poised to hit the PC market , having announced a partnership with Intel . MediaTek will be offering up its 5G modems to Intel , and in turn , laptop makers , with the fruits of the partnership expected to hit the market around 2021 . This isn ’ t the first time we ’ ve seen computers loaded up with cellular connectivity - Qualcomm ’ s chips connected devices like the HP Envy X2 back in 2018 , for example . After reviewing that generation of Windows 10 on Snapdragon devices , however , it was clear that connectivity came at the cost of performance . Why MediaTek ’ s partnership is different - and in turn , exciting , is because , by just supplying the 5G modem and letting Intel get on with making its tried and tested processors , there could be less margin for error . This could mean full-fat Windows and blisteringly fast data-speeds wherever you have 5G signal - so long tethering and WiFi hunting , as well as latency-free on-the-go online gaming . Dell and HP are expected to be amongst the first to make laptops packing Intel chips with MediaTek modems , so watch this space . Smartphones are getting the 5G treatment too , with MediaTek ’ s new 5G chipset , the Dimensity 1000 also announced . This could herald a wave of lower-cost 5G flagships , if the company ’ s value-centric history is anything to go by . What ’ s cool about this 5G chipset is that it supports 5G dual-carrier aggregation ; in English , that means it can grab two 5G networks and pool their speeds together , enabling downloads of up to 4.7Gbps . That means a 100GB 4K movie could download in just over 21 seconds ! With its 7nm architecture , MediaTek is claiming that the Dimensity 1000 delivers greater power efficiency than other 5G SoC , as well as support for 80MP camera sensors and AI image processing too . It ’ s also the world ’ s first chip to pack an Arm Mali-G77 GPU , so is expected to deliver flagship-grade gaming on displays with refresh rates of up to 120Hz . Luckily , we don ’ t have to wait until 2021 to get our Dimensity on , with 5G phones powered by MediaTek ’ s flagship processor expected to launch in Q1 2020 . While we don ’ t know which smartphones will be getting the Dimensity 1000 , current MediaTek partners include Motorola , Oppo and Sony , so our best guess lies with them .

Intel has apologized for the CPU shortages which have plagued would-be buyers of its processors for some time now , in a letter published via its online newsroom . The letter , written by Michelle Johnston Holthaus , executive VP and GM of Sales , Marketing and Communications at Intel , begins : “ I ’ d like to acknowledge and sincerely apologize for the impact recent PC CPU shipment delays are having on your business and to thank you for your continued partnership . “ I also want to update you on our actions and investments to improve supply-demand balance and support you with performance-leading Intel products . Despite our best efforts , we have not yet resolved this challenge . ” As you ’ re probably aware , issues around stock shortages have blighted Intel for some time now , and the chip giant ’ s problems in producing enough 14nm CPUs to meet demand have been ongoing since way back last year ( tied in with even more prolonged struggles to get 10nm to be viable in terms of mass production ) . In the letter , Intel further observed that it has invested ‘ record ’ levels of capital in increasing 14nm wafer capacity throughout the course of 2019 ( while also ramping up 10nm ) . The company also said it had expanded its own manufacturing capability , and increased the use of foundries to produce more Intel processors , efforts which have all led to boosting its PC CPU supply by ‘ double digits ’ in the second half of this year compared to H1 2019 . But Holthaus then notes : “ However , sustained market growth [ in PCs ] in 2019 has outpaced our efforts and exceeded third-party forecasts . ” The demand for CPUs is such that Intel still can not meet it , despite all these efforts , is essentially the long and short of the situation as it stands . With supply remaining tight , Intel says that it ’ s “ less able to absorb the impact of any production variability , which we have experienced in the quarter ” . We recently heard rumors ( from Intel partners including big-name laptop manufacturers ) that the CPU shortages could continue well into 2020 , for at least another quarter or two , and that speculation would seem to marry with Intel ’ s latest comments on the matter . Meanwhile , Intel faces further pressures from AMD which is kicking up a storm with its latest Ryzen 3000 processors , not to mention Epyc server chips . And this leaves Intel in a strange and uncomfortable position whereby it is staring down the barrel of an intense supply/demand conundrum , while simultaneously facing major pressures from AMD that has meant Intel has been forced to slash prices on some CPUs despite the shaky supply lines . Intel , then , is being pulled one way and another by stock shortages and demands of a different kind on the price-cutting front . Meanwhile , the dominance of Ryzen 3000 desktop CPUs is making further demands in terms of the urgency for Intel to push out new 10th-gen Comet Lake processors – a further refinement of 14nm which , admittedly , are looking impressive from the recent leaks we ’ ve seen .

If you still need to switch from Windows 7 , Intel and software developer Laplink have released a free tool that will transfer your files to a new PC . There are now just two months until Microsoft ends support for Windows 7 , but despite this – and in spite of the fact that the operating system is now an astonishing 10 years old – huge numbers of people are still using it . Why ? Intel has looked into things , and its research suggests that the hassle involved in moving files , settings and other data from one computer to another is one of the main reason people stick with their old machines . But with end of support for Windows 7 fast approaching , the millions of people still using the operating system are at risk of missing security updates from Microsoft – in addition to using very old software . To help with this , Intel has teamed up with Laplink Software and announced a free version of its data migration tool . PCmover Express has been made completely free for personal use and can be used to move from an old Windows 7 computer to a new , Intel-based Windows 10 machine ( previously it cost $ 29.95 , €23.95 or £20.95 in different parts of the world ) . The software can migrate files , documents and user settings , making the process of moving to a new computer much less of a headache . The software is only free for home users ; Laplink says that a commercial license is available `` for about $ 20 '' . The free edition of PCmover Express will be enough for most people , but there 's also a special offer if your needs are a little greater . Laplink is offering a 50 % saving off the usual price of PCmover Professional , which can also transfer applications from one computer to another . The pro version of the software can be yours for $ 29.98/£20.98 ( about AU $ 40 ) ( down from $ 59.95/£41.95 ( about AU $ 90 ) .

We 've been sitting here , waiting for Intel Xe graphics cards ( GPUs ) for years at this point , but we might have finally seen something that gives us an idea of what they 'll look like . And , PC gamers might want to brace themselves . Intel 's first Xe graphics cards will be code named `` Ponte Vecchio , '' according to a leaked press deck spotted by VideoCardz . Rather than taking on AMD and Nvidia in the perennial graphics card war , however , these Intel Ponte Vecchioi GPUs will instead be intended for Exascale computing . So , they 'll probably be very powerful and very expensive . This is all a part of a supposed `` Project Aurora , '' which will see these Intel Xe graphics cards launch alongside some new Xeon processors and a new API for programmers . All of this further cements these graphics cards as non-gaming PC components , but it at least means some interesting technology may filter down to the consumer market at some point , even if we do n't know what that technology looks like yet . There 's still hope for anyone waiting for Intel gaming graphics cards with bated breath , though . According to VideoCardz , there was a slide in the press deck that said we 'd see gaming cards from Intel eventually – we just might not see them right away . Whenever we see Intel Xe graphics cards enter the mainstream , however , it will be about time . We ca n't wait to see what the graphics card landscape will look like once a third company enters the ring . Who knows , graphics cards might become affordable again once Nvidia has some tough competition at the high end . But , we 'll just have to wait and see what happens .

The security of Intel hardware has once again been called into question after another serious security vulnerability was uncovered . Following the well-publicised issues surrounding Meltdown and Spectre , a new flaw has been uncovered that could allow hackers to gain entry to devices powered by Intel CPUs . However the affected systems do n't feature older generations of Intel hardware , but instead are those powered by the latest Cascade Lake CPUs , with both 10th Gen Intel Core and 2nd Generation Intel Xeon processors affected . The vulnerability , named ZombieLoad 2 , or TSX Asynchronous Abort , targets the Transactional Synchronization Extensions ( TSX ) feature in Intel processors . Speculative execution typically looks to boost the performance of the CPU by running instructions in advance of knowing if they are needed or not . ZombieLoad attacks were first detected in May 2019 , when it was discovered they could use malicious program to steal sensitive data from memory locations that normally they could not access . Now , a second generation , ZombieLoad 2 , has been found to be able to get around the defences put in place after the initial attacks were detected and steal sensitive data from the operating system kernel or other processes . Intel has documented the full extent of the flaw in a blog post , noting that the issue should be fixed through Microsoft 's latest November 2019 Patch Tuesday updates , with Intel recommending users patch their systems immediately .

Intel ’ s next-gen NUC – which is essentially a tiny PC – has been spotted going up for pre-order at online retailers in the US . NUC 10 ( dubbed ‘ Frost Canyon ’ , or so the rumor mill has it ) will come in three different flavors with Intel ’ s latest Comet Lake processors . The 4-inch by 4-inch mini- machines will be driven by the Core i7-10710U , Core i5-10210U and Core i3-10110U to be precise . That top-end Core i7 part is an impressive six-core ( 12-thread ) processor capable of Turbo up to 4.7GHz to give you an idea of the power on tap here . The i5 is a capable quad-core ( eight-thread ) CPU , too ( capable of hitting 4.2GHz boost ) . Those hoping for a bit of pep on the casual gaming front , though , should note that these might be cutting-edge Comet Lake chips , but they aren ’ t processors with Intel ’ s more powerful ( Gen11 ) Iris Plus Graphics . Instead , they carry the standard Intel UHD Graphics ( whereas Intel ’ s current Bean Canyon NUCs do have Intel Iris graphics courtesy of their 8th-generation Coffee Lake-U processors ) . As Wccftech notes ( which spotted this via Twitter leaker @ momomo_US ) , the mini PCs are now up for pre-order at BLT – and indeed at other online retailers – with prices starting at around the $ 330 mark ( about £260 , AU $ 480 ) for the Core i3 model . Obviously these NUCs aren ’ t released yet , though , and it ’ s not clear when the launch date might be – but we can assume that it must be fairly close now .
The introduction of the Core series of processors was a new chapter in Intel ’ s history . Year after year , following a ‘ tick-tock model ’ , Intel defined the benchmarks on how fast and efficient processors should be . But the last few years have taken some of that shine off- not only has Intel struggled to move to a smaller manufacturing process below 14nm but ARM-based processors that drive almost every single smartphone out there have become the most sought-after piece of silicon . Steve Long , Vice President & General Manager of Intel ’ s Sales and Marketing Group was recently in the UAE to promote the Intel Innovation Center in Dubai and TechRadar Middle East managed to get some time with him during his visit . Driving innovation is our first and foremost priority , independent of processor technology . The focus should be on what you are bringing out and how you are making a difference , and how people use technology . Gone are the days where it was about the bits and bytes of it , now it ’ s about what people can do with it . It is absolutely not . It ’ s alive and well . We continue to bring and drive innovation , and push things forward . We are ramping our 10th gen processors on 10nm technology . The 10nm is important as it allows us to bring new capabilities and differentiate our capabilities around better integration and graphics improvements . The new technology allows us to bring AI and deep learning inside the CPU where we can actually improve the user experience . This is not what I would want to talk about right now but here ’ s what you should think about – what we do at Intel is we ramp technologies , and our 10th gen processor which we just announced will be the fastest ramp that we have ever executed . Over the next 3-4 months , you will see it will surpass any ramp . We have a phenomenal product in the works that ’ s coming out next year . Ultrabooks set a wave of innovation around thin and light form factors , and setting a certain level of expectations from a user delivery that lead us to where thin and light are pretty much mainstream . I think we are at the cusp of the next wave of innovation with Project Athena . With Project Athena , we went out and studied how people actually use technology . This is years of making- we are studying what we call a new class of consumers . We categorize them as ‘ mobile go-getter ’ , somebody who is used to using multiple devices . They are used to a phone first experience but then go to the PC to get things done . And they have a higher expectation of what they want out of the PC . For Project Athena we studied how these mobile go-getters actually use technology , and we drove an experience-first innovation . We saw that they expect their device to be always ready , they come to the device and they want to focus , and they want their device to be adaptable . Those are the three things that a user wants out of it . There ’ s a ton we can talk about the engineering and technologies that makes those things possible . We are working with hundreds of ecosystem partners on creating components that can enable those three kind of things that the user cares about . Our vision of devices continue to evolve and foldable form factors will absolutely and eventually fit into a category of Project Athena . Neo is the first foldable device which is powered by Intel , which we spent years co-engineering with Microsoft on that product . It doesn ’ t categorize as experiences that we are measuring for Project Athena , but it will eventually fit into the Project Athena form factors as we go forward . Competition brings out the best in everyone- it ’ s better for consumers . We are excited to compete with products that we have , with Microsoft and with all of the OEM partners . The Surface group , the devices that we have , and the form factor and the experience they are trying to drive , and their vision for the Surface products is one where Intel will continue to participate in . Their data center , Azure , are co-built together using our artificial intelligence , which is based on some of the capabilities of Intel technologies , so it ’ s still a great partnership and we are excited about what we can do with them . Like I said , we continue to push the innovation envelop across the global scale and our differentiation is at a platform level . Very few companies can integrate different technologies and bring them to a market in a way that you can aggregate memory differentiation , you can aggregate Wi-Fi 6 where we have features that users care about . And when you look at the aggregate of all the different technologies that come together in a platform , we believe we are well positioned to continue to compete and take things forward . And we are going to take on markets – we are going to go after graphics , and take our game in places where we haven ’ t been before . We are very excited about what ’ s coming out . You are going to see us by the end of next year or the beginning of the following year getting into the discrete ( graphics ) side as well . We ’ d like to thank Intel and Steve Long for allocating their time to TechRadar and are excited to see the products that Intel releases over the next couple of years .

AMD 's latest CPUs built on the Zen 2 architecture are ticking a lot of the right boxes , and now the company appears prepared to give its higher-end models a boost . A number of Ryzen 9 APUs ( CPUs paired with GPU cores on the same chip ) appear in a leak from @ Komachi_Ensaka on Twitter , shared by Notebookcheck . This leak shows a listing of products from AMD , and next to each processor name , there 's a designation that appears to indicate graphics cores . In the case of four Ryzen 9 processors , there appear to be 12 graphical compute units . These are 45W Ryzen 9 and 15W Ryzen 9 Pro models , making them appear to be likely contenders for high-performance mobile computers . As APUs , they would be ahead of standard CPUs in the naming scheme , thus appearing as Ryzen 4000-series products while still using the Zen 2 architecture found in Ryzen 3000-series CPUs . A few powerful Ryzen 9 APUs to feature in mobile devices could further boost AMD 's surging strength , and push it even further in mobile . The company recently got a boost thanks to its prominent placement in Microsoft 's recent Surface Laptop 3 . However , we tested a Ryzen 5 model with nine Vega compute units , and it just did n't compete with similar laptops that featured simple dedicated graphics solutions . That could change with the new generation of APUs and the boosted compute unit count , though . The new Ryzen 9 APUs would benefit from the increased efficiency and clockspeeds available thanks to their their 7nm design , and therefore get even more from the integrated Vega graphics compute units . As Intel 's Ice Lake processors push performance and efficiency ahead for Team Blue , and Tiger Lake could take it further , new Ryzen APUs could help AMD stand out with a powerful , all-in-one solution .

A new report has laid bare just how well AMD is doing with chipping away Intel ’ s CPU market share , with sales of its 7nm Ryzen 3000 processors allowing AMD to begin to seriously challenge Intel ’ s market-leading position . The report comes from Mercury Research , a market analyst firm that specialises in PC components , and it seems like AMD is doing incredibly well , with its latest 7nm processors – and aggressive pricing strategy – paying off . However , while AMD is certainly on a roll , its old rival Intel does n't seem to be going down without a fight . AMD now has an 18 % market share when it comes to the desktop CPU market . This is a leap over the previous quarter , which was 17.1 % , and is an impressive 5 % increase year-over-year . While Intel still enjoys a hefty lead over AMD , it surely can ’ t be too pleased with those numbers – especially as they will very likely continue to improve . This is because AMD had encountered some supply issues when it first launched its Ryzen 3000 processors , and was unable to deliver enough chips to meet demand . With those supply issues seemingly fixed , AMD should have no issue with flooding the market with its in-demand CPUs . With the powerful AMD Ryzen 9 3950X and new Threadripper processors due to land imminently , AMD could see another wave of strong sales , potentially further increasing its CPU market share . On the server side of things , AMD has now got 4.3 % market share , and while that still represents a huge uphill battle , it ’ s going in the right direction with a year-over-year increase of 2.7 % . The data from Mercury Research has slightly different numbers to the ones AMD released , which predicts a bigger market share , due to the different types of processors they count . AMD ’ s market share when it comes to mobile processors ( found in laptops ) has also been improving , with a 14.7 % market share in the third quarter of 2019 , an increase of 0.7 % from the previous quarter , and 3.8 % increase year-over-year . With AMD ’ s CEO , Lisa Su , promising Ryzen 4000 Mobile processors in early 2020 , we could see further growth in this key market for AMD . It ’ s already scored a big win with Microsoft releasing an AMD-powered Surface Laptop 3 . Previously , Surface devices have used Intel processors exclusively . With Ryzen 4000 Mobile processors bringing the 7nm process and Zen 2 technology to laptops , these new chips should address some of the complaints previous AMD-powered laptops have been subjected to , especially around poor battery life and general performance . While Intel remains in the lead in each part of the CPU market , AMD is doing a fantastic job of growing its market share in every area . Its recent successes have certainly appeared to provoke Intel into fighting back , with the current market leader cutting the prices of its products seemingly in response to AMD ’ s renewed threat to its market share . And while it looks like Intel ’ s ongoing supply shortages could be a blessing for AMD , and last well into 2020 , the company is looking to aggressively take on AMD when it comes to winning back the process lead . Currently , AMD is ahead with its 7nm process , which Intel won ’ t match until 2021 . So , it looks like things could be getting very interesting in the CPU market share war . Via Tom ’ s Hardware

Intel ’ s new flagship Core i9-9900KS – a heavily binned variant of the 9900K which boosts to 5GHz across all eight-cores out of the box – can be overclocked to 5.2GHz according to Silicon Lottery , although only a very small percentage of the processors are capable of this feat . If you ’ re not familiar with the company , Silicon Lottery sells CPUs which are pretested and guaranteed to reach a certain speed when overclocking , for folks who want to avoid the so-called ‘ silicon lottery ’ ( whereby some chips have a greater tolerance for overclocking than others ) . And according to Silicon Lottery , only 3 % of Core i9-9900KS processors can run at 5.2GHz ( or potentially faster ) . As to how much you ’ ll pay for a Silicon Lottery guaranteed 5.2GHz Core i9-9900KS , it ’ s a pretty tidy sum : $ 1,199.99 ( around £930 , AU $ 1,740 ) . More than double the asking price , in other words ; although the company is out of stock right now anyway , in case that didn ’ t put you off . Silicon Lottery also sells the CPU overclocked to 5.1GHz – 31 % of the chips are apparently capable of this – and also at 5GHz . Yes , any of Intel ’ s Core i9-9900KS processors can hit 5GHz when boosting , but these are CPUs guaranteed to run overclocked at 5GHz constantly . That said , the company found 100 % of 9900KS chips could be overclocked to 5GHz ( as you might expect ) . So it ’ s probably not worth paying extra to pick one of those up from Silicon Lottery , as it will run you to $ 599.99 ( around £465 , AU $ 870 ) , rather than the recommended retail price which is just over $ 500 ( around £390 , AU $ 720 ) . The big picture here is that at least going by these statistics , your chances of getting a ‘ golden ’ sample which is capable of a 5.2GHz overclock without becoming unstable are pretty slim indeed . However , Intel has obviously pushed these processors so hard already in achieving these clocks that it ’ s no real surprise there ’ s little extra headroom for overclocking . We have previously seen an alleged example of a pre-release Core i9-9900KS hitting 5.2GHz on just air cooling , so it seems that denizen of Reddit got very lucky with the lottery . Via Wccftech

Intel ’ s next-gen Comet Lake-S desktop processors have been revealed in a major leak detailing the purported full line-up , and providing info on exactly how fast some of these chips will be . We should state upfront that these are alleged CPU and spec details , which we can ’ t be sure of , and we need to treat any leak like this with a suitable degree of caution . That said , Wccftech seems to have got hold of some Intel slides which are very revealing when it comes to the chip giant ’ s 10th-gen desktop processors based on a refinement of its 14nm++ process , which will supposedly be headed up by a 10-core ( 20-thread ) as previously rumored . That would be the Intel Core i9-10900 which purportedly runs with a base clock of 3GHz and Turbo to 5.1GHz ( that ’ s presumably single-core boost ) , and it has 20MB of cache ( no clock speed details are provided for the unlocked K version of this chip , by the way ) . Also , as previously speculated , there is hyper-threading throughout the entire 10th-gen Core desktop family , from the Core i3 upwards . The Core i3-10100 is a quad-core part with eight-threads and a base clock of 3.2GHz with Turbo to 3.8GHz ( allegedly – take that as read for everything in this report , of course ) . Intel ’ s Core i7-10700 will apparently sport 8-cores and 16-threads with a base clock of 3GHz and Turbo to 4.8GHz . And the Core i5-10500 runs with six-cores and 12-threads with a base clock of 3.2GHz and Turbo to 4.3GHz . Pentium chips remain dual-core CPUs with four-threads ( and the Celeron processors at the very bottom of the 10th-gen range don ’ t get hyper-threading ) . Comet Lake-S will support up to 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes , and comes with a new CPU socket ( LGA 1200 ) , so will also require a motherboard upgrade . Another leaked Intel slide gives a taster of performance , with an apparent 8 % improvement in Windows applications compared to Intel ’ s predecessor 9th-gen chips ( that ’ s as measured under SYSmark 2014 SE ) . There ’ s a bigger boost in multi-thread compute performance with an 18 % increase ( going by the SPECint benchmark ) . TDPs will allegedly be 65W down the Core range for these chips ( although the K variants will , of course , draw more power – although how much more isn ’ t specified in this spillage ) . While this seems to be a pretty full picture of what we can expect , as ever , we must be wary of placing too much trust in any early leaks . However , judging from what we can see here , the Core i9-10900 looks an impressive performer – particularly given that alleged headline Turbo speed of 5.1GHz , which as noted is presumably single-core . But perhaps more interest and focus will be placed on the mainstream Core i5-10500 six-core CPU which looks to offer a 100MHz uptick on the Core i5-9600 in terms of base clock speed , albeit with slightly slower ( 300MHz lower ) Turbo – but then the unlocked version could offer some potentially tempting overclocking performance . And naturally , a great deal will depend on exactly how Intel prices these chips when they emerge , which according to the rumor mill will be in the first quarter of 2020 . However , if Intel ’ s recent huge price cuts in the high-end desktop processor arena are anything to go by , we can but hope we ’ re in for a pleasant surprise… It ’ s certainly clear that Intel needs to do something to stop the rot in the enthusiast desktop CPU market , where AMD ’ s Ryzen is currently running away with the game .

Just a little while ago we were able to catch a glimpse of the Intel Core i3-10300 , a hyperthreaded entry-level chip from the upcoming Intel Comet Lake-S lineup . But , now , thanks to a new leak , we may have seen the entire range of 10th-generation desktop processors . Some leaked slides from Intel appeared on Informatica Cero showing a broad lineup of desktop processors , from the 4-core , 16-thread Intel Core i3-10100 to the 10-core , 20-thread Intel Core i9-10900K . If these leaks are to be believed , we should see some much improved multi-core performance out of Intel in 2020 . But the leaks go even further . In some now-removed slides on VideoCardz , we got to see some more detailed information about the new lineup . For instance , Comet Lake-S processors will apparently feature up to a 4.8GHz all-core turbo , which will result in some extremely fast performance when the processors are pushed to their limits . What we do n't know yet is if it 'll hold a candle to AMD . Here are the processors that were leaked , along with their single-core Turbo speeds : According to these leaked slides , core counts see a modest bump up from 8 cores to 10 in the flagship Core i9-10900K . But unless the processor sees a healthy price cut a lá Cascade Lake-X , we 're not sure how well it will hold up against AMD Ryzen 3rd Generation processors , the flagship of which has 16 cores . Another mystery here is how much further Intel can push performance without it moving to 10nm . Comet Lake will still be based on Intel 's 14nm manufacturing process , and we just have to wonder just how much further speed and efficiency can be pushed there . Either way , with how fast these leaks are coming out , our guess is that we 'll learn much more about these processors at CES 2020 , which is rapidly approaching . Via PC Gamer

For anyone that 's been following the computing industry over the last year , it 's probably not too surprising or controversial to say that Intel has n't had its best year ever . The Santa Clara chip manufacturer faced a number of challenges in 2019 , from its own silicon shortages to recent developments in the ever-turning Intel vs AMD processor wars . But it was n't all bad . Intel did release some very promising technology this year , mostly when it comes to its 10nm Ice Lake laptop chips that kick off a new age for Intel-based laptops that it 's calling Project Athena . All of this leaves Intel in a pretty interesting spot this year , and makes us intensely curious what it will be doing at CES 2020 and beyond - those desktop chips have to be somewhere , right ? Either way , because 2019 is finally over and 2020 is peeking from around the corner , we 're going to dive into all the major breakthroughs and defeats that Intel experienced in 2019 , along with what we predict for 2020 . Because we knew that AMD would be releasing a slew of 7nm processors in 2019 , we were expecting big 10nm moves from Intel in response . And , that 's exactly what we got at CES 2019 . Well , kind of . At the giant tech conference , Team Blue announced its new Sunny Cove architecture , built on a 10nm process , that would be behind the upcoming Ice Lake microarchitecture . What we did n't know at the time though , is that Sunny Cove would be almost entirely built for laptops , rather than desktops . Essentially , Intel was hinting at a mobile platform that would n't come out for months , along with Lakefield , a new hybrid CPU architecture meant to take on Qualcomm 's increased competition with the likes of the new Qualcomm 8cx chipset found in the Surface Pro X . But , even though this was announced way back at CES 2019 , we still have n't seen it materialize into an actual product . In fact , we did n't hear more about Ice Lake until Computex 2019 , which was a whole five months later . At the giant computing event in Taipei , Intel spilled more details on Ice Lake , and how it would in fact be shipping in 2019 . Some clarification was also given on what Project Athena actually was - rather , is . Rather than a single product or CPU microarchitecture , it is a multi-year-long initiative that would see Team Blue pushing mobile computing further , improving AI and power efficiency to produce more accessible computing for everyone . When Ice Lake laptops started to hit the streets in September 2019 , we noticed that a lot of them were more power efficient and mobile , but we 've yet to see how Intel 's AI focus will truly impact your average consumer . We 've heard about how your computer would be able to learn what users need the most power for , and intelligently boosting performance around these personalized tasks , but there just is n't an excellent way to test that for ourselves quite yet . Ice Lake was n't the only mobile architecture on offer by Intel this year . Comet Lake also managed to power a lot of the best laptops this year , but there was a catch : it was still based on the same 14nm process as Intel 's been stuck on for years . This meant that these chips were n't much of an improvement over 2018 's Whiskey Lake . And for the most part it seems like there were far more laptops with Comet Lake than Ice Lake , perhaps because the new 10nm Sunny Cove architecture is in shorter supply . We just hope that in 2020 , Intel can go all-in on 10nm . Also at Computex 2019 , Intel announced the Core i9-9900KS , a `` special edition '' of the Intel Core i9-9900K with an all-core boost clock of 5.0GHz . The only problem was that the Core i9-9900K really had no problem hitting that via overclocking , providing you had a halfway-decent cooling solution . When we finally got our hands on the Intel Core i9-9900KS for review , we found that it was only marginally faster than the original chip at stock settings , which was pretty disappointing . That alone would n't have been a huge deal , but 2019 marked the first year that Intel did not release a new desktop lineup of processors , leaving AMD Ryzen 3rd Generation to take over the desktop market completely unopposed . Intel fell behind AMD both in performance and market share , which was only exacerbated by some bizarre claims made by its marketing . This is definitely something that Intel needs to improve on in 2020 if it wants to remain competitive in the desktop space . Intel still has a leg-up when it comes to single-core performance ( which is especially important in PC games ) , but that gap narrows with every single generation , and if Intel does n't do something , AMD will absolutely come out on top in 2020 in that area , as well . In 2018 Intel only just managed to pull ahead of Threadripper 2nd Generation , but with a higher price tag . We expected the same thing to happen this year as well , with Intel tackling Threadripper 3rd Generation directly . But reality , as always , is stranger than fiction . We heard that Cascade Lake-X processors would be coming out in November 2019 , and that they 'd be significantly cheaper than prior generations , to the tune of as much as 50 % . And while we have n't had a chance to get a full review of the Intel Core i9-10980XE , our own internal testing points to a chip that 's slower than AMD 's Ryzen 9 3950X . Not only is that chip cheaper , but it 's on the mainstream X570 platform which is also more affordable than the Intel X399 motherboard you 'll need to actually use the 10980XE . Intel has essentially reached the limit of what it can do on the 14nm process , and it will absolutely need to move to 7nm across its desktop platforms to remain relevant in 2020 . In a lot of ways , 2020 is going to be a make-or-break year for Intel : if it does n't innovate in the desktop space , Team Blue is going to be all but irrelevant . Hopefully , CES 2020 , which is right around the corner , will give us some hint as to what we can expect from the 10th-generation desktop lineup of processors , especially because Coffee Lake Refresh came out so long ago . We 're also expecting the veil to be lifted from Intel Xe graphics cards , but we would expect those to be shown off at Computex 2019 , as that show is all about breakthrough computing technology . Beyond that , we fully expect Project Athena to develop even more , delivering laptops that can truly last all day in chassis that we can easily toss in our bag without even noticing the weight difference . Tiger Lake is promising to be at least an interesting mobile platform , and the replacement for Ice Lake may even be the first glance we get of Xe graphics - sometimes things come in the weirdest packages . At the end of the day , we want nothing more than for Intel to remain competitive across the entire computing landscape . AMD is on top of the world right now , providing Intel with competition it has n't faced in years . But , if Intel does n't adapt and provide some meaningful improvements in the desktop space , we could see the processor market becoming stagnant again in a few years . 2020 will likely give us a pretty good idea of whether or not that will happen .

It 's been a minute since we 've seen new desktop processors from Intel , with Team Blue basically going all of 2019 without releasing a single mainstream desktop chip , with the exception of the Intel Core i9-9900KS . But that era of silence might be ending . A leaked UserBenchmark entry for an Intel Core i3-10300 has just appeared , giving us an idea of what to expect from Intel 's next generation of desktop Core processors , and it shows us that Intel might be feeling that heat from AMD . Intel Core i3-10300 U3E1 , 1 CPU , 4 cores , 8 threadsBase clock 3.7 GHz , turbo 4.2 GHzhttps : //t.co/HlFLpGzPIK pic.twitter.com/0Ug5vz3hXtDecember 26 , 2019 The leak , spotted by famed silicon leaker TUM_APISEK on Twitter , points to the Core i3-10300 as being a 4-core , 8-thread part with a boost clock of 4.2GHz . If this leak is accurate , and again this is a leak , it would be the first desktop-class Core i3 processor with hyperthreading in a long time . The current-generation Intel Core i3-9300 , for example , is a 4-core , 4-thread part with a 4.3GHz boost . These specs might not be extremely detailed , but it 's enough to be exciting nonetheless . AMD Ryzen processors have essentially made their name on making hyperthreaded processors accessible for everyone , so we 're definitely excited for Intel to jump on this bandwagon . What we do n't know is whether or not this is going to be a part of the rumored Intel Comet Lake-S lineup , or if Intel is skipping that to bring 10nm silicon to the mainstream desktop market . The inclusion of hyperthreading in an entry-level model seems to suggest that something new may be afoot . We guess we 'll just have to wait to see what Intel has to show at CES 2020 and beyond , but the CPU market may continue to heat up next year , and we 're so here for it .

Ice Lake was notable because it was Intel 's first 10nm manufacturing process that actually made its way into real products , but we may have just gotten a glimpse at what the next refinement of the process will be capable of . Some leaked benchmarks for an unspecified Tiger Lake-U processor with 4 cores and 8 threads were posted by user JZWSVIC on Chinese tech forum Zhihu . The leak itself does n't post any specific information about the architecture or the name of the processor , all we can tell is that there are two versions of the chip , a 15W and a 28W , the latter of which is obviously much more powerful than the current-generation 15W offering . The forum post compares these benchmark scores against the 15W Intel Core i7-1065G7 , and while the 28W chip is obviously much faster , what 's particularly interesting is the difference between the two chips with the same TDP ( thermal design power ) . The 15W Tiger Lake-U processor is up to 32 % faster in one of the tests , which is a huge bump in performance for a single generation . Now , it 's important to note that these are leaked benchmarks and should be taken with a grain of salt . While we do know that Tiger Lake is coming , Intel has n't shared much in the way of detailed information about its 10nm++ microarchitecture , so we do n't really have much to compare these leaked benchmarks against . Either way , as the release of Tiger Lake draws closer , we 're going to start seeing a ton of leaked benchmarks for the new chips , so we 're only getting started with these early leaks . One thing is for sure , though : Ultrabooks keep getting thinner , lighter and faster thanks to Project Athena , so if these leaks are to be believed , we could be seeing some amazing laptops in 2020 .

SafeBreach labs has discovered a vulnerability in Intel Rapid Storage Technology ( Intel RST ) that could allow malicious programs to bypass antivirus software . Researchers from the firm discovered that in older versions of the software , the IAStorDataMGRSvc.exe executable will try to load four DLLs ( Dynamic-link libraries ) from the Intel Rapid Storage Technology folder on a user 's C drive . However , these DLLs do not exist in the same folder as the program 's executable which means that IAStorDataMGRSvc.exe will instead try and load these DLLs from other folders on a user 's computer . SafeBreach took advantage of this to create their own custom DLL that is loaded once IAStorDataMGRSvc.exe starts . Since this executable runs with system privileges , the researchers ' DLL is loaded with the same privileges and thus has full access to the computer . The vulnerability SafeBreach discovered can not be exploited by an attacker for privilege escalation since it requires administrative privileges to create a custom DLL in the first place . However , the vulnerability could be used by an attacker to bypass antivirus scanning engines as the custom DLL will be loaded by the trusted Intel application . SafeBreach researcher Peleg Hadar explained to BleepingComputer how an attacker could leverage this vulnerability , saying : `` An attacker can evade the antivirus by running within the context of Intel and perform malicious actions . Tested , and it works , very interesting and useful technique . '' SafeBreach first reported the vulnerability to Intel back in July and the chipmaker has since released updated versions of its Intel Rapid Storage Technology software that patch the issue . It is recommended that users running older versions of Intel RST update their software to the latest version to prevent falling victim to any attacks that exploit this vulnerability .

Intel has announced that it has acquired the Israeli programmable chipmaker Habana Labs for approximately $ 2bn as the company looks to further expand its AI efforts . Habana Labs is a developer of programmable deep learning accelerators for the data center and Intel will leverage its technologies to bolster its own AI portfolio while also pushing further into the AI silicon market . EVP and GM of Intel 's Data Platforms Group , Navin Shenoy explained how the acquisition will help advance its AI strategy in a press release announcing the deal , saying : “ This acquisition advances our AI strategy , which is to provide customers with solutions to fit every performance need – from the intelligent edge to the data center . More specifically , Habana turbo-charges our AI offerings for the data center with a high-performance training processor family and a standards-based programming environment to address evolving AI workloads . ” Habana Labs ' core products , the Gaudi AI Training Processor and the Goya AI Inference Processor , target workloads in AI and machine learning . Currently the Gaudi system is being tested by select hyperscale customers but it is expected to deliver a 4X increase in throughput in large node training systems . The Goya processor on the other hand is already commercially available and it helps boost inference performance including both throughput and real-time latency . Recently Intel has committed significant resources to expanding its AI hardware portfolio as well as to developing AI use cases for the cloud , data center and edge computing . AI is already bringing in $ 3.5bn in annual revenue for the chipmaker but it believes that its current AI capabilities will allow Habana to scale while also helping to accelerate the development of its GPUs . Once the deal receives regulatory approval , Habana Labs will continue operating independently under its current management team though it will now report to Intel 's data center group . Via ZDNet

A mysterious incoming six-core Intel processor has been spotted courtesy of a leaked benchmark , and interestingly , the amount of cache it carries seems to indicate that it ’ s a new architectural design from Intel . As to exactly what this chip might be – if anything , seeing as we can only put so much stock in a single benchmark which has turned up online , this one coming from the SiSoft database – that isn ’ t clear , although there ’ s a lot of guesswork going on around this . The leaked SiSoft result shows a six-core ( 12-thread ) CPU , or rather a pair of these used in some manner of server or workstation configuration . As Tom ’ s Hardware points out , the key spec here is that the L2 cache is 1.25MB ( per core ) , which doesn ’ t line up with any of Intel ’ s existing architectures ( Coffee Lake chips have 256KB of L2 , Ice Lake mobile 512KB , and HEDT Cascade Lake-X processors run with 1MB – so still less than this leaked chip ) . Really , this is all up-in-the-air speculation right now , but it seems that this processor is a new architecture on 10nm , and perhaps the most likely prospect is that it ’ s Tiger Lake , the successor to Ice Lake ( and expected to debut in notebooks next year ) . That ’ s because previous spilled details on Tiger Lake indicate that it will indeed have 1.25MB of L2 cache , just as this leaked chip does . Again , that ’ s just a rumor though , and what also counts against it is we haven ’ t seen evidence that Tiger Lake will stretch its legs past quad-core . So the other possibility is that it ’ s Rocket Lake , which does have up to 8 cores , but that ’ s built on 14nm – which could indicate this is a back-ported 10nm core . Or there ’ s even the chance that this could be a server-targeted Ice Lake ( Xeon ) chip ( although that seems very much an outside possibility ) . Whatever the case , this has certainly fired up a lot of speculation about where Intel might be headed with this one , but given that we ’ ve not got much to go on from this SiSoft benchmark , it really is impossible to draw anything but shaky conclusions . Ultimately , we ’ re just going to have to wait for more evidence to pop up as to what this might mean for Intel ’ s future CPUs . Meanwhile , what we do know is that Intel ’ s Comet Lake-S next-gen desktop processors are set to be released in the near future , possibly in April 2020 ( although that might turn out to be perilously close to the release of Ryzen 4000 ) .

Intel ’ s next-gen Comet Lake-S desktop processors have been the subject of more online leakage , this time detailing the specs of one of the 10th-gen CPUs – and apparently a finished version of the chip . A 3DMark result posted on Reddit ( via prolific Twitter leaker Momomo_us , as spotted by PC GamesN ) shows what appears to be the final version of Intel ’ s Core i5-10600 ( as opposed to the engineering samples which have graced previous leaks ) . If this is correct – and we have to exercise the usual caution , and note that the result has since been removed ( although that could be because it ’ s on the money ) – it shows the i5-10600 is a 6-core ( 12-thread ) processor with a base clock running at 3.3GHz and a Turbo of up to 4.7GHz . It would seem that the leak pertains to the finished model because it has the full processor name in place , rather than the usual placeholder names which denote early engineering samples ( which won ’ t be representative of the final spec or performance you can expect from the CPU ) . Note that the result also showed the Core i5-10600 was nestling in an MSI Z490 Pro Carbon WiFi motherboard . So yes , in case you missed this , Comet Lake will require a motherboard upgrade ( as it uses a different socket – albeit one of the same size ) . Regarding the potential release date of next-gen Comet Lake , the general buzz on the grapevine has been that that these chips are expected to arrive early in 2020 , probably in the first quarter – although the most recent speculation pointed to a slightly later timeframe , namely an April release . However , if finished versions of processors are now floating around – and of course that ’ s a sizeable if we can ’ t take for granted – maybe we can expect to see Comet Lake-S desktop chips in Q1 of next year after all . That would certainly be good for Intel , as it needs to get some fresh silicon out there to counter the threat of AMD ’ s hot-selling Ryzen 3000 CPUs . And indeed to move in good time before Ryzen 4000 processors pitch up ( AMD has previously indicated that these Zen 3 chips will arrive in the latter half of 2020 , so that could mean late summer , potentially ) . Previous leaks have pointed to the Comet Lake-S Core i5-10400 ( also 6-core , 12-thread ) being clocked at 3.5GHz with Turbo up to 4.1GHz , and a flagship Core i9 that runs with 10-cores ( 20-threads ) , supposedly with Turbo up to 5.1GHz . As to exactly how Comet Lake-S next-gen chips will shape up against Ryzen 3000 , it ’ s obviously way too early to guess , but one thing is fairly clear , namely that Intel will have its work cut out in terms of competitively pricing the new CPUs , given the value proposition of AMD ’ s latest desktop processors .

Intel has been having a tough time recently trying to compete with AMD in the desktop segment , that 's nothing new . But , Intel has been busy making some confident claims , this time revolving around the Intel Core i5-9600KF . A Chinese marketing slide has been spotted by Wccftech , sourced via the Baidu forums . This slide makes claims about the Intel Core i5-9600KF and the Intel Core i3-9350KF , stating that they 're better than the Ryzen 7 3800X and the Ryzen 5 3600X , respectively . That 's big if it 's true , but it 's a little more complicated than that . The core reason Intel cites for these claims is that the boost clocks are higher , which is n't exactly news . However while we have n't tested the Intel chips in question , the Ryzen processors come pretty close to matching single-core performance in spite of Intel 's higher clock speed . It is important to note that this is all based off of a translation , so there may be some information that 's lost . So , is this a case of Intel just misleading consumers , trying to stop more people from jumping on the AMD bandwagon ? Or are there some legitimate claims being made ? Because we have n't tested the Intel Core i5-9600KF and Core i3-9350KF ourselves , we ca n't actually make any sweeping statements that Intel was wrong here . However , we have reviewed a few other Coffee Lake Refresh chips and plenty of AMD Ryzen 3rd Generation processors , so we can make a couple of judgements . Intel has told us repeatedly that tests like Cinebench and Geekbench do n't represent real-world workloads , but we still think they 're helpful in showing the peak performance of each chip we run through them . The days of applications being single-threaded are over , so we think these tests are going to become more important , rather than the other way around . Just comparing the Ryzen 7 3700X to the Intel Core i7-9700K seems to poke some holes in Intel 's claims . In Cinebench R15 's multi-core test , the Ryzen 7 3700X is about 30 % faster – and that Core i7 is probably significantly faster than the Core i5 . Again , we have n't tested the Intel Core i5-9600KF , but we feel like it 's pretty obvious that the Core i7 is faster than the Core i5 – but maybe we 're wrong ? Even in single-core workloads , the Intel Core i7-9700K does n't pull as far ahead of the Ryzen 7 3700X as Intel may want you to believe . Now , Intel 's chips are faster than AMD processors in pure single-threaded applications like games , but the gap is getting smaller and smaller . In Middle Earth : Shadow of War the Intel Core i7-9700K is just 6 % faster . That does mean that if you 're just going to be gaming , Intel 's chip is probably going to be the better option , but only just barely . We do n't think a lot of people are using their computers , for one thing , these days , especially not at the price range of the higher-end processors . We did reach out to Intel and AMD for comment on this marketing slide and we 'll update this article as soon as we hear back . Either way , when you go out to pick out a processor , you really need to take what your plans for it are into consideration . If all you need to do is play games , Intel is still probably the way to go . Almost anything else though – a case can be made that Intel has fallen behind , and this marketing is n't going to change that . Via TechPowerUp
Fed up of rebooted movies ? Or remakes of old games ? Creativity and originality are dead in contemporary culture , you say ? Well we ’ re not sure how you ’ ll feel about the prospect of ancient processors rising from the silicon grave , but this is exactly what Intel has done with its latest move in the CPU arena . Intel ’ s Pentium G3420 is a Haswell chip based on a 22nm process which was released back in Q3 of 2013 , over six years ago now , but as Tom ’ s Hardware spotted , it has been resurrected and is now back on the chip giant ’ s roadmap . In a product change notification document , Intel let customers know that : “ Cancelling this Product Discontinuance completely per new roadmap decision and enabling the product long term once again . ” The dual-core Pentium processor , which has a base clock speed of 3.2GHz , will apparently be sold through to May 2020 . So what ’ s this all about then ? Surely no one wants to buy an old and crusty Pentium which was first released six years ago ? Well , no , not in the consumer sphere anyway , but this chip is aimed at PC manufacturers ( for use in cheap builds ) and the likes of the embedded market and thin clients . The reason it could have been brought back , as Tom ’ s Hardware theorizes , is perhaps to help cope with demand in such markets , given that Intel is struggling to make enough contemporary CPUs ( and thus might need to fall back to an older process , to help pick up some of the slack ) . We recently heard Intel apologize for these processor shortages , which have been ongoing for some time now , and are set to remain a problem . Investing ‘ record ’ levels of capital to boost 14nm production throughout the course of 2019 simply hasn ’ t been enough , and we have previously heard that Intel has shifted to use 22nm on CPUs which are on the fringe to help deal with demand – and arguably that might be the case here .

AMD could launch its Zen 4 processors – which don ’ t represent its next-gen CPUs , but rather the generation after – as soon as 2021 , according to a new rumor . This is the case according to a report from China Times ( spotted by Wccftech ) , which claims that TSMC ’ s 5nm process is progressing nicely , and that mass production should fire up around July 2020 . The first three customers for 5nm have also reportedly been locked in by TSMC , and they include AMD ( as well as Apple and HiSilicon – the latter is on-board for its next-gen Kirin chips ) . So the report claims that with mass production of 5nm starting in the summer of next year , we can expect to see Zen 4 processors from AMD launch in 2021 . As ever with these kind of rumors though , we have to be very cautious , and the report sounds far from certain ( we should also consider the possibility that something may have been lost in translation here ) . This purported launch timeframe is more than a bit of a surprise , as we ’ ve previously heard that Zen 4 – which is being shaped and implemented alongside Zen 5 , with two separate ‘ leapfrogging ’ design teams – is due to arrive in 2022 . So making it 2021 would appear to be pushing things going by what AMD has previously indicated , hence the need for plenty of condiments here . China Times , however , insists that TSMC is making good progress on 5nm – in fact such good progress that yields have already overtaken 7nm ( reaching 50 % ) . Monthly production is already ramping up considerably at TSMC with yields outpacing expectations , and what this means is mass production is on track to happen sooner . Hence AMD ’ s Zen 4 processors – which will presumably be the Ryzen 5000 series – could also happen earlier than expected , at least in theory . Of course it would give AMD the added advantage of pressuring Intel even more with this pace of development . If all this makes you feel like hanging on for Ryzen 5000 , if it is indeed nearer than expected , there ’ s one other interesting thing to note here . Going by what we ’ ve heard about Zen 4 Epyc server-targeted processors , the chips may use a new socket , and thus require a new motherboard for upgraders . And while this doesn ’ t necessarily mean that consumer Zen 4 will do the same , it seems likely . We ’ ve also heard the mention of Zen 4 using a new type of memory , which could indicate a jump to DDR5 RAM , and again that would all fit with a switch to a new motherboard . All this remains speculation , naturally . As for the other big firms who are apparently the first to sign up to 5nm with TSMC , Apple is on board for its A14 , the report notes , which is allegedly the 5nm chip to power next year ’ s iPhone 12 . And as already mentioned HiSilicon has signed up for its next-gen Kirin processors which will be 5nm ( the Kirin 1000 is rumored to be destined for the Huawei Mate 40 range next year ) .

Following whispers that Amazon was about to usher in 2nd-gen processors to be used in its servers and data centers , the company has revealed exactly that : new Graviton2 chips . AWS Graviton2 7nm SoCs follow-on from the original Graviton models ( obviously ) and use Arm ’ s Neoverse N1 architecture as the previous speculation dictated . That rumor contended that there would be 32-cores , when in fact the chips will run to 64-cores , and Graviton2 represents a huge performance boost compared to its predecessor . In fact , Amazon says that Graviton2 is capable of delivering up to a sevenfold performance increase compared to 1st-gen-based A1 instances across all cores , and up to twice the performance per core . Memory access will be up to five times faster than the original Graviton chips , too , thanks to additional memory channels and double-sized per-core caches . The new processors were shown off at the AWS re : Invent 2019 cloud conference , with the expected array of slides highlighting the strengths of Graviton2 . That includes a boast about a new generation of ARM-based instances which are 40 % better in terms of price/performance compared to current ( fifth-gen ) x86-based instances . So as expected , these are hitting hard in terms of value proposition and that price/performance ratio . Amazon ’ s own benchmarking shows some big per-vCPU performance gains compared to M5 instances , including around a 43 % increase in SPECjvm 2008 , a 44 % boost in SPEC CPU 2017 integer , and an increase of around 24 % in SPEC CPU 2017 floating point . Amazon further notes : “ The new instances raise the already-high bar on AWS security . Building on the existing capabilities of the AWS Nitro System , memory on the instances is encrypted with 256-bit keys that are generated at boot time , and which never leave the server . ” Amazon says it ’ s working on three different kinds of Graviton2-powered EC2 instances : general-purpose , compute-optimized and memory-optimized . It ’ s now running M6g ( general-purpose ) instances in preview , for testing with non-production workloads , and a full rollout is expected to begin in 2020 . As we observed yesterday , the price/performance ratio on offer with Graviton2 is a very compelling draw , and this truly is Amazon making a real move to push ARM in the data center , an arena that Intel currently dominates – but is also under fire from AMD ’ s top-notch 2nd-gen Epyc silicon .

Intel has revealed it sold its smartphone modem chip business to Apple at a “ multi-billion dollar loss ” after it was allegedly forced out of the market by Qualcomm . In a recent blog post , executive vice president and general counsel at Intel , Steven R. Rodgers explained that the chipmaker was forced out of the market due to Qualcomm 's patent licensing practices and he argued that the decision against the company should stand , saying : “ We invested billions , hired thousands , acquired two companies and built innovative world-class products that eventually made their way into Apple ’ s industry-leading iPhones , including the most recently released iPhone 11 . But when all was said and done , Intel could not overcome the artificial and insurmountable barriers to fair competition created by Qualcomm ’ s scheme and was forced to exit the market this year . ” However , Qualcomm appealed the ruling and it wo n't be enforced until after the appeal is concluded . Back in May , US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose wrote a 233-page decision in which she said that Qualcomm 's patent licensing practices “ strangled competition ” in the modem chip market . Koh then ordered the company to renegotiate its licensing agreements to be more reasonable . Qualcomm has denied the FTC 's accusations against it and other parts of the US government have even urged the appeals court to pause enforcement of the FTC ruling against the company . However , replacing Qualcomm wo n't be so easy as both the Pentagon and the Department of Energy said in July that Qualcomm was a “ trusted ” supplier of 5G technology and that the firm would be “ impossible to replace ” in the short term . Intel 's brief is filed with the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals , where Qualcomm is currently trying to overturn an antitrust decision against it following a lawsuit by the US Federal Trade Commission .

Rumor has it that AWS ( Amazon Web Services ) is set to bring in more powerful second-gen processors for use in its servers and data centers , with the ARM-based CPUs apparently bristling with as many as 32-cores . The next-gen chips will reportedly be based on ARM ’ s Neoverse N1 architecture and would succeed current AWS ’ first-gen Graviton processors , being something like 20 % faster , according to a report by Reuters which cites two industry sources . As Anandtech , which spotted the report , further notes , Neoverse N1 is designed around providing maximum single-thread performance , running at relatively high frequencies . We are talking clock speeds of up to 3.1GHz , with a likely TDP of around 100W . While Amazon ’ s chips obviously won ’ t be able to rival the likes of Intel ’ s or AMD ’ s server processors in terms of pure performance , by the looks of this , they are set to offer an impressively beefier level of performance than their predecessors . And they will likely do so at a very competitive price/performance ratio ( both in terms of the overall price , and the ongoing cost of running the chips ) . So this could represent a reasonably potent threat to Intel ’ s dominance in the server market , because if these efforts pan out – and remember , this report is just speculation ( albeit from one of the more reliable sources in the tech world ) – AWS could certainly turn to use more of its own hardware . Of course , Intel is already under heavy fire in the server market , fighting a battle against AMD ’ s rival chips . AMD ’ s latest Epyc ( Rome ) processors are innovative and powerful offerings ( running with up to 64-cores ) which have already tempted some big-name defections away from Intel , including Google and Twitter ( and indeed AWS itself – for the time being , perhaps ) .
Intel is struggling with perfecting its Xe GPUs , according to the latest chatter from the graphics grapevine . We should point out upfront here that this is the kind of rumor we have to be very , very careful around , originating from a simple Chiphell forum post made by a leaker who claims to have insider knowledge of Intel ’ s progress on the graphics card front . Or lack of it , apparently , as the source indicates that progress does not seem to be going well on the new GPUs , which face an uphill battle against long-established players in the graphics market ( Nvidia and AMD ) . Not only this , but the efficiency of Intel ’ s Xe graphics solutions is apparently ‘ relatively low ’ in comparison to those rivals . It ’ s worth noting that this speculation is referring to Intel ’ s initial version of the Xe GPU , and not the Ponte Vecchio product aimed at heavyweight computing usage we heard about recently , which is built on Intel ’ s own 7nm process . Speaking of Ponte Vecchio , the post also contends that the data center GPU won ’ t be out in 2021 as Intel has previously indicated , but there ’ s a good chance it may not launch until 2022 . Slippage of a year would not really be all that surprising , though , and any major hardware launch can suffer in such a manner . Another claim is that Intel ’ s graphics driver needs a lot of time to be improved , and that right now , there ’ s no intention of having third-party GPUs on the market when the video cards are launched – there will only be an Intel reference card . It might be tempting to dismiss all this out of hand as a flaky rumor , and while indeed we should exercise some serious caution here , as previously noted , this particular leaker ( ‘ Wjm47196 ’ ) does have form in getting things right with GPU predictions . Wjm47196 previously revealed information about the launch of AMD ’ s Navi graphics cards before it happened , and was on the money with the rumors in that case . The other point worth considering is that there has been another potentially worrying development at Intel on the GPU front in recent times , namely the departure of a couple of key personnel on the marketing side . Chris Hook , who was graphics and visual technologies marketing chief , left Intel at the end of November , along with Heather Lennon , senior manager , digital marketing in the graphics department ( who only joined back in April 2019 , from AMD – in fact both of these former Intel employees came across from AMD ) . Considering we are now ( allegedly ) closing in rapidly on the launch of Xe graphics , a pair of key marketing gurus leaving has certainly raised more than a few eyebrows . At the end of October , the first standalone Xe graphics card was officially ‘ powered on ’ , and previous rumors hold that we should expect the initial Xe offering maybe as soon as mid-2020 , or perhaps later next year . We ’ ll just have to see how things pan out . Finally , it ’ s worth noting that Wjm47196 also recently floated another rumor that AMD will hold its first preview of next-gen ( 2nd-gen RDNA ) Radeon graphics cards at CES . Via Wccftech

AMD is owning Intel even harder in the CPU world now , achieving a record market share according to one European retailer that produces sale stats on a monthly basis – and not just hitting a high in terms of units shifted , but also revenue made . German retailer Mindfactory ’ s figures for November indicate that AMD sold over 25,000 processors , compared to around 5,000 for Intel . In terms of percentages , AMD sold 82 % of all CPUs last month – compared to 18 % for Intel – which is a new high for the company , outdoing the 81 % AMD managed to hit in September . AMD has been selling close to ( or just over ) the 80 % mark ever since July and the launch of Ryzen 3rd-gen processors , when its market share jumped from an already very healthy 68 % to 79 % . Of course , we can ’ t put too much stock ( pun not intended ) in figures from a single retailer , compared to the bigger picture , but nonetheless they seemingly represent a consistent indication of AMD ’ s domination – at least in the desktop PC processor market ( remember Intel does still rule the overall CPU roost when you take into account the likes of laptops and business PCs ) . And don ’ t forget , other retailers tell a similar story , as we saw very recently from Amazon ( and previously from the likes of South Korean operations ) . What ’ s even more interesting is the fact that AMD has now secured a share of 77 % of the revenue , going by Mindfactory ’ s stats . And that ’ s a bigger move upwards compared to the previous high of 74 % achieved when Ryzen 3000 chips first launched . In other words , Ryzen CPUs aren ’ t just selling more in terms of pure quantity , but the processors are also bringing in more money for AMD – pointing to the sales of higher-end ( more expensive ) chips increasing . All of which must make really depressing reading for Intel , even if it does still hold a lead in terms of the average sale price and revenue taken , relative to units shifted – but not by much , now , with AMD apparently gaining very fast . Remember that before Ryzen 3000 , AMD still held the lion ’ s share of units shifted ( as we mentioned previously , in June just before the launch of Ryzen third-gen , AMD had 68 % of the market ) , but revenue was split more like 50-50 with Intel , thanks to the latter ’ s much higher average selling price per chip . That changed dramatically with the launch of the new Ryzen processors , however , and now AMD is almost on equal footing with Intel in terms of average selling price ( at least according to this one retailer , anyway ) . And of course , on top of all this , Intel is still facing serious stock and production problems when it comes to its processors… Via Wccftech

AMD ’ s CPUs are again winning big against Intel , not just in current sales , as we ’ ve previously seen , but also sentiment in terms of future processor purchases that consumers might make , at least according to a new report . The survey from the European Hardware Association ( EHA ) canvassed the opinions of tech enthusiasts across Europe ( specifically folks who read EHA publications ) , and found that they “ expressed a distinct preference when asked about the next desktop processor that they would buy , with over 60 % choosing AMD ” . Obviously that leaves 40 % in the Intel camp . This is a big change from last year , when the picture was reversed , and 60 % preferred Intel . It shows the major impact that Ryzen 3000 processors have had in 2019 , grabbing a huge slice of the desktop enthusiast CPU pie as we ’ ve seen in various different stats and reports that have emerged throughout this year . Another way to look at this is that AMD has gained 50 % more supporters in the last year , which is a huge leap , without a doubt . EHA chairman Koen Crijns noted : “ The last three years has seen AMD gain a lot of momentum in the enthusiast segment . With the Ryzen series of CPUs , AMD has eliminated any lingering performance gaps , while offering a great price/performance ratio . ” Of course , Intel has not only had to fight a battle in terms of that price/performance value proposition offered by AMD , but has also been plagued by production and supply issues with its Core family of CPUs . The EHA survey also found AMD had gained ground in the GPU arena , too , although as other reports have indicated , the company is still way behind Nvidia . Almost 23 % are in favor of AMD ’ s graphics cards , which obviously still leaves Nvidia winning big , but AMD is at least making progress , considering that back in May , only 19 % of those the EHA surveyed chose AMD over Nvidia . As ever , we have to be careful about exactly how much we read into just a single report , but it ’ s no real surprise that tech enthusiasts are starting to more heavily skew towards AMD when it comes to processors .
