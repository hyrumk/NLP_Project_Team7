Amazon 's MP3 store for Android mobile phones has finally gone live in the UK , offering DRM-free downloads for your handset . The new store , which was first mentioned when Android was first shown off in 2008 , has been active in the US but has now opened in the UK too , which we brought you news of earlier this week . The songs cost around 69p per track and mostly between £3 and £9 per album , which is darn sight cheaper than other outlets on the internet . Dual outlets The songs can be downloaded over both Wi-Fi and 3G , but the application does n't have a dedicated media player , so you 'll need to use the standard Android music player if you want to actually hear the tunes . It seems there are two versions of the Amazon MP3 application : one that works on Android v1.5 ( ie the HTC Magic , the Samsung Galaxy and the LG Intouch Max ) and one that works with v1.6+ , like the Motorola Milestone and the HTC Hero . We 're waiting to find out if there will be anything more coming from Amazon on this front , but we 're glad the UK has finally caught up with the US , albeit nearly a year later . Via Amazon

Google 's latest update to its phone OS - Android 2.1 - has finally arrived in the UK , courtesy of the Google Nexus One handset and with it a number of new UK-specific features . One of the more interesting things is that now you can get direct access to the Amazon MP3 store from the phone , something the US has had since the G1 . The service comes preloaded on the Nexus One and offers up information on the latest songs and albums and how much they cost . App-reciation In all there are 9 million tracks available on the store , plenty then to plug the music gap which has been bugging Android users in the UK . The launch of the UK-specific Amazon MP3 store on Android – something which still needs to be confirmed by Amazon itself – may well be the killer app needed for Google to challenge Apple and its iPhone as the multimedia handsets of choice . With poor US sales seemingly blighting the Nexus One , however , Google will be looking towards the myriad upcoming devices sporting the 2.1 firmware upgrade and hoping that this music access will be able to sway those who are currently tethered to iTunes .

Amazon has sealed as deal with the British Library to make a whopping 65,000 books available to Kindle owners and via CreateSpace 's Print on-Demand service . The books were digitised as part of a partnership with Microsoft 's Livesearch , and just hours after agreeing a patent deal with Microsoft , Amazon has now launched a joint venture with the British Library for tens of thousands of 19th century philosophy , history , poetry and literature . The content will be available on Amazon 's sites in the United States , UK , France and Germany , bringing a host of unique content to the public . Literary gems Chief Executive of the British Library , Dame Lynne Brindley , said : `` The British Library 's deal with Amazon to make literary gems available through print-on-demand and the Kindle e-book reader is a landmark agreement in more ways than one . `` Unlocking 65,000 titles of 19th century material for new generations to discover , the deal also shows how innovative public sector institutions can keep moving ahead , even in a tough economic climate . `` Re-imagining our relationships with both private and public sector partners is absolutely essential for extending our ability to connect with our users . `` The British Library has much to offer major commercial organisations such as Amazon , giving us an opportunity to leverage the high value of our collections to ensure doors that might have been closed for lack of funding remain open . '' The content will include work from the likes of Charles Dickens , Jane Austen and Arthur Conan Doyle as well as books like Strange Story by Edward Lytton .
Amazon has signed a patent agreement with Microsoft that will allow the two companies to share technology . Microsoft confirmed the deal , stating that it would allow two of the tech world 's biggest players to collaborate . `` We are pleased to have entered into this patent license agreement with Amazon.com , '' said Horacio Gutierrez , corporate vice president and deputy general counsel for Intellectual Property and Licensing at Microsoft . `` Microsoft 's patent portfolio is the largest and strongest in the software industry , and this agreement demonstrates our mutual respect for intellectual property as well as our ability to reach pragmatic solutions to IP issues . '' Kindle and servers Amazon – the world 's biggest online retailer – has had a huge hit with its Kindle eBook reader , making it a major player in the burgeoning world of digital books . Part of the agreement means that Amazon is now shielded from patent litigation for software on the Kindle , as well as their Linux-based servers . Microsoft added that Amazon would pay an undisclosed amount under the patent licence agreement .

Amazon has begun selling physical books published by Macmillan again , suggesting the beginning of a resolution in the battle over ebook pricing between the publisher and the retailer . It all began a week and a half ago , when Macmillan , whose imprints include Farrar , Straus and Giroux , and Henry Holt and Co. , demanded that Amazon charged more than the standard $ 9.99 for its titles that were sold as ebook titles for the Kindle reader . Macmillan wanted more control over the prices charged . Amazon responded by suspending all Macmillan ebook titles from sale , and followed that up a week ago by removing all Macmillan titles from its site – something that was bound to have an impact , since Amazon is the world 's largest book retailer . Physical titles back on sale Now that the dust has settled and tempers have cooled a little , Amazon has begun re-selling Macmillan titles . Macmillan ebooks are still not available , though , and the Amazon site is displaying a message for those want electronic versions : `` Tell the publisher ! I 'd like to read this book on the Kindle . '' Macmillan wants to be able to charge $ 12.99 to $ 14.99 for its ebook titles . Other publishers have also complained about the low prices Amazon is charging for ebooks . In a letter to authors , Macmillan Sargent wrote : `` I want to assure you that Amazon has been working very , very hard and always in good faith to find a way forward with us . '' Quite whose way that will be remains to be seen . Via Reuters

Amazon could be taking on the might of Valve 's Steam in the game download market , if a new job listing is anything to go by . Downloading content is becoming increasingly big business for the online retailer , which already has download offerings for its Kindle eBook , MP3 music and movies . So it makes total sense that it would try to add videogames to its list of content download stores . Amazon has so far refused to comment on the rumours . Steam gets some competition ? Valve might have some serious competition in the near future according Colin Sebastian , an analyst at investment bank Lazard Capital . Sebastian draws our attention towards a number of job postings at Amazon , noting : `` Our periodic checks of job postings uncovered a search by Amazon in the video game category to help implement a new digital distribution platform . '' `` As in other segments of digital media , we expect Amazon to pursue new opportunities as an aggregator of online games , similar to Steam ( PC ) , BigPoint ( browser ) and others . '' Valve is set to launch Steam for Apple Mac in April . Via MCV

Amazon has reportedly partially-refunded a man for his PlayStation 3 purchase after he claimed that the removal of the option to have Linux on the console rendered it not fit for purpose . The furore over Sony 's decision to remove the option to install other operating systems on the PlayStation has not only sparked a war of words , but now could have a commercial impact . According to PlayStation University one owner has been granted a partial refund , without having to return the console , after citing Directive 1999/44/EC which deals with products being fit for the 'purpose which the consumer requires them and which was made known to the seller at the time of purchase ' . Repercussions Although confirming the story is proving difficult ( TechRadar has contacted both Amazon and Sony but has not yet had replies ) , the repercussions if Amazon has offered a refund in this case could be huge . TechRadar 's early investigations suggest that , if the feature was considered as an advertised function at the point of sale , then removing it could indeed cause problems under the UK 's Sale of Goods Act - which is enforcable for six years after purchase in England and five in Scotland . It is the seller ( ie Amazon in this case ) rather than the manufacturer who must refund the money , but it 's clear that taking away any advertised feature with a firmware upgrade could become a thorny area for companies .

Amazon.com Inc has struck two new deals with major book publishers on the pricing of e-books The Wall Street Journal reports this week that CBS Corp 's Simon & Schuster and News Corp 's HarperCollins will set their own prices for e-books on Amazon.com Amazon versus Apple Selected new best sellers will be priced at $ 9.99 ( £6.55 ) , though most new e-books will be priced between $ 12.99 ( £8.52 ) to $ 14.99 ( £9.83 ) . Most older e-books on Amazon.com from the two publishers will cost less than $ 9.99 . It is a similar deal to that made by the two publishers with Apple for the iPad 's iBookstore application . The Apple iPad , as you most likely know , launches in the US on Saturday . Via Reuters

Amazon has just introduced audio and video to the Kindle e-reader , although the features will be limited to those using Kindle on Apple 's iPhone , iPod touch or iPad . Amazon already has a number of books available for Kindle in multimedia editions such as Rick Steves ' travel guides , Best of the Beatles For Acoustic Guitar , and Bird Songs : 250 North American Birds In Song . Adding voice narration to digital books on your iPhone , iPod touch or iPad is certainly going to be a feature that many users will value , particularly in such things as travel guides and instructional manuals . Added Kindle functionality `` We are excited to add this functionality to Kindle for iPad and Kindle for iPhone and iPod touch , '' notes Dorothy Nicholls , Director , Amazon Kindle . `` Readers will already find some Kindle Editions with audio/video clips in the Kindle Store today -- from Rose 's Heavenly Cakes with video tips on preparing the perfect cake to Bird Songs with audio clips that relate the songs and calls to the birds ' appearances . This is just the beginning -- we look forward to seeing what authors and publishers create for Kindle customers using the new functionality of the Kindle apps . '' Rich Steves ' London Kindle Edition , for example , offers users walking tours of the capital with the author narrating as you perambulate ol ' London town . Bill Newlin , Steves ' publisher at Avalon Travel , notes that : `` Rick 's narration adds depth to the reader 's experience , while listeners can follow the routes more easily with the text . '' Perhaps the strangest aspect of Amazon 's latest move is the fact that video features can only be accessed on Kindle publications via the Apple apps the company has developed , with its own dedicated Kindle device limited ( right now , at least ) to basic e-ink , regular audio books and its text-to-speech function .

Amazon may have sold 180 Kindle books for every 100 hardback books in the past month , but despite the burgeoning new market the company 's quarterly results did not please the financial world . Even with growing sales and profit , shares in Amazon took a major hit after the online retailer 's numbers came up short of expectations . Amazon announced revenue of $ 6.6 billion for the second quarter of 2010 , a 41 per cent rise year on year . Profits were also up , with Amazon declaring a 45 per cent rise from the same quarter in 2009 to $ 207 million . Shares down But it was n't enough in the world of high finance , and the company 's share price tumbled because the numbers did not reach predictions . The Kindle ebook reader featured heavily in Amazon 's financial report , with the company stating that sales of ebooks were rocketing . `` Amazon.com is now selling more Kindle books than hardcover books , '' stated Amazon 's release . `` Over the past three months , for every 100 hardcover books Amazon.com has sold , the Company has sold 143 Kindle books . `` Over the past month , for every 100 hardcover books Amazon.com has sold , the Company has sold 180 Kindle books . '' `` This is across Amazon.com 's entire U.S. book business and includes sales of hardcover books where there is no Kindle edition . `` Free Kindle books are excluded and if included would make the number even higher . ''

Amazon has launched a UK grocery web site , taking on the established supermarket giants such as Tesco , Wal-Mart 's Asda , Waitrose 's Ocado and Sainsbury 's . Not only that , you can buy beer on the site . Perhaps the ultimate in laziness for the home-worker that can not even be bothered to pop out to the local off-license anymore ! Of course you may well have to wait 8 days for it as the courier will get lost and then you 'll have to pick it up from your local sorting office ... Massive growth in online supermarkets Amazon launches the beta of its British grocery service this week . `` Find everything you need to stock your kitchen cupboards , '' reads the new page on Amazon.co.uk , promising a range of goods from fresh fruit , veg , meat and poultry through to dried goods , booze and lots more . However , the online retailer will not give users the traditional two-hour time slots for planned deliveries , which may well put many dedicated online supermarket shoppers off the new service . Online supermarket Ocado recently announced that it hopes to be valued at over £1 billion in the initial public offering later this month , a clear indicator of the massive value of the online grocery market in the UK . Industry analysts at IGD forecast that the market for online shopping will double in total and be worth a whopping £7.2 billion pounds by 2014 , according to Reuters . In addition to the aforementioned booze , Amazon UK plans to sell over 22,000 products from established brands like Kraft , Pepsi and Procter & Gamble , some of which will be provided by third-party members of Amazon Marketplace .

Hitwise has published its biggest e-tailers list in the UK , with Amazon.co.uk holding on to top spot , and Argos holding off Play for second spot . Amazon.co.uk has been in top spot since Experian HitWise started producing the list , and the UK version is joined by its big global brother Amazon.com ( 6th ) in the top 10 . Argos and Play , in second and third respectively , are also being pushed hard by Apple in fourth and supermarket Tesco in fifth . Next , Your M & S , Tesco Direct and easyjet.com make up the top 10 , with the top consumer electronics sellers Apple ( 4 ) , HP ( 24 ) and Currys ( 26 ) all moving up the rankings . Physical still matters `` With multichannel retailers now accounting for two-thirds of the top 50 merchants , it is clear that those with both physical stores and an online presence are leading the growth in e-retail , '' said IMRG 's CEO , James Roper . `` This is also evidenced in the IMRG Capgemini E-retail Sales Index , where multichannel retailers are consistently outperforming their pureplay counterparts in terms of sales growth . `` Not surprisingly , fashion retailers continue to move up the Hot Shops List as clothing remains one of the fastest growing online sectors .

Amazon may have just spilled the beans on the upcoming HTC announcement , offering two mystery handsets for pre-order . The HTC Desire Z , or the HTC Vision as it 's been codenamed , is hidden at the end of the 'HTC smartphone ' category of Amazon UK , with a pre-order price of £455 . The HTC Desire HD was spotted on the site earlier by Electric Pig with a price tag of £415 , but of more interest is the appearance of the Desire Z , which has been shown as the QWERTY keyboard-toting HTC Vision in the past . Coming to the UK ? The only mention of this phone before was on a German network database , which listed the Desire Z and Desire HD as coming soon , but to see it in the UK will undoubtedly spark rumours of a forthcoming UK launch too . However , before we get too excited , it 's not uncommon for website managers to pre-load product pages based on rumour - the fact these phones are known as the HTC Ace and HTC Vision hint that this might be the case . We 've spoken to Amazon for clarification on these two mystery phones , and will let you know as soon as we hear back .

Amazon is reportedly looking at new gadgets and hardware in addition to its hugely successful Kindle range of e-readers . Amazon 's online Kindle store has only recently launched in the UK but recent job postings at the company 's R & D Lab 126 ( the division responsible for the Kindle ) shows a range of interesting new job vacancies such as Hardware Engineer and RF Systems Engineer . The New York Times speculates that there is `` a good chance these engineers will be recruited to build other gadgets that Amazon is prototyping in its secret labs . '' What is inside Lab 126 ? Citing sources close to Amazon 's plans in this area , who chose to remain anonymous , the Times adds that , `` Lab 126 has been looking into building other gadgets that it could sell to consumers . '' One source said that new products were developed with one key objective – to make purchasing content available on Amazon as easy as possible . To date the focus has been on books , but this could well soon be expanded to cover music , movies and more . `` Jeff [ Bezos ] 's original goal for the lab was to build a range of other devices , '' said one source . `` There was talk of music players and other electronics . '' Exactly if and when we will see an Amazon-branded music and movie player is still to be confirmed , of course . Amazon has yet to comment on the rumours . Via The New York Times

Amazon has announced the arrival of its Kindle store , bringing thousands of ebooks to the UK . Amazon revealed last week it was introducing the Kindle to the UK for the first time , with a 3G and Wi-Fi version penned in for a September release . The opening of the UK store means that users will be able to buy their bestsellers in pounds and pence , rather than logging onto the US version of the site to get content . Book 'em Amazon is boasting that there are 400,000 ebooks available on the site and these include 84 out of the 100 bestsellers in the UK . Now that the store is open , you can actually pre-order your device and purchase media for it now , so it is there for you when the Kindle actually arrives . As with the US store the ebooks on offer are n't just exclusive to Kindle users , they can be viewed on all manner of devices – including iPad , iPod touch , iPhone , Mac , PC , and those packing Android . The Kindle UK release date is September and will be priced from £109 . Check out the store now at www.amazon.co.uk/kindlestore .

Apple and Amazon are being taken to task by Connecticut 's Attorney General over what he refers to as 'anti-competitive ' ebook pricing deals with publishers . Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has requested that representatives from Apple and Amazon attend meetings at his office to discuss the ebook pricing issue . Blumenthal refers to their deals with major book publishers such as Macmillan and Simon & Schuster as `` most favored nation '' arrangements . MFN deals and anti-competitiveness `` The net effect is fairly obvious , '' writes Blumenthal in an open letter to Amazon , `` in that MFNs will reduce the publisher 's incentive to offer a discount to Amazon if it would have to offer the same discount to Apple , leading to the establishment of a price floor for ebooks offered by the publisher . '' Blumenthal hopes that through a discussion with the two tech giants that Amazon and Apple will find an acceptable way forward to `` allay his concerns '' . Apple 's arrangement with publishers is to offer them a 70 per cent royalty while keeping 30 per cent to cover the costs of running its iBookstore , requiring publishers to guarantee that prices elsewhere will not be higher than those charged by Apple . `` MFN clauses - especially when they are offered to two of the largest e-book retail competitors in the United States - have the potential to impair horizontal competition by encouraging coordinated pricing and discouraging discounting , '' the Connecticut Attorney General wrote to Apple . `` Of course , the concerns are compounded , and hence potentially more troublesome , since this arrangement appears to be something that will be agreed to by the largest ebook publishers in the United States and two competitors who combined will likely command the greatest retail ebook market share .

Amazon is taking on Google at its own game and is all set to launch an Android app store . A rival to Google Market , the Amazon store will allow you to pay for apps through Amazon 's checkout system , according to TechCrunch . Although the details of what an Android user would gain from getting apps from Amazon are sketchy , there 's no doubting that a competing store to the Android Market would make Google up its game , especially given that Market is not nearly as polished as the Apple App Store . Developer details What details have emerged are to do with how developers will be paid and how much they have to pay to make apps for the store . It seems that there is a $ 99 developer fee to join the program and the split of royalties is a confusing 70 % of the purchase price or 20 % of the List Price . There will be an extra layer of DRM on the apps which make them unique to Amazon and , interestingly , if you are a cross platform app maker , you have to update the Android app at the same time as you update apps on other platforms . The Amazon store is set to have both paid and free apps and the applications may show up in Amazon listings . For now , it seems that this is US only , but as Amazon has brought the Kindle to the UK ( finally ) we expect there to be a UK version of the store as well . Via Mobile Choice

Amazon UK has put the Samsung Galaxy Tab up for sale ahead of its launch next month – at a whopping £799 . The 'Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab Smart Media Device ' is listed with a 1GHz processor , 7-inch LCD screen , Bluetooth 3.0 and Android 2.2 , although no UK release date . Given that these are all specs found in the average mobile phone ( the 7-inch screen aside ) it 's truly hard to see where the cost hikes are coming for the new Samsung Galaxy Tab . Could it be true ? Other sites , such as Clove , are listing the Galaxy Tab for a lower-but-no-less-palatable £615 price point , and Samsung confirmed to TechRadar recently that the post £600 price point is indeed genuine , although it may change before launch . Apple 's iPad , by comparison , costs up to £699 – but that 's with 64GB of flash memory and a 10-inch screen ... and it 's made by Apple , so you can see where all the cost hikes have come in . Either way , it 's hard to see how Samsung hopes to make the Galaxy Tab competitive unless some networks are planning to offer huge subsidies on a very long-term contract , as otherwise this new device is going to barely register in the fight against the iPad . Thanks to Matthew for the tip !

Sony has announced it has managed to create the world 's first touchscreen e-reader which does n't impede the quality of the e-ink screen - the next-generation of the Sony Reader Touch . When TechRadar caught up with Amazon at the launch of the Kindle , Steve Kessel , senior vice president for Kindle at Amazon was vehement that it would never make a touchscreen device as it would impinge on readability . Kessel noted : `` If you put touch on an e-ink display – a reflective display – then anything you put on the top ruins readability . You can already see this with some devices which are out on the market at the moment that have integrated touch into the displays . '' No extra layer Sony knows this and this is why it has managed to create a touchscreen display for the Sony Reader Touch which does away with the extra layer and with it the reflectiveness of the display . `` You usually have to put a film over the e-ink display to make it touchscreen but we have created the only device this year which is finger controlled and with no extra layer , '' explained Sony Reader marketing manager Omar Gurnah . The Sony Reader Touch does come equipped with a stylus but the new optical screen technology , called E Ink Pearl , can be used with fingers as well . The new tech also means improved contrast with 16 levels of greyscale . Waterstones has the Sony Pocket Edition priced at £159.99 and the Sony Touch retailing for £199.99 . Both of these are currently on pre-order with the UK release date for both the Touch and Pocket set for 17 September . It will be interesting to see if the next iteration of the Amazon Kindle in the UK will indeed adopt the technology Sony is using or if it will speak to its non-touchscreen word .

In what is becoming something of an industry trend , Amazon.com is reportedly approaching media companies with a proposal for an 'all-you-can-eat ' style TV and movie streaming service . Amazon.com has approached Time Warner , CBS and Viacom , according to Reuters ' sources . Talks are currently at an early stage , claim the same unnamed sources . Amazon 's US website already offers a number of TV shows and movies in its video-on-demand section at a cost of $ 1.99 and upwards Amazon , Apple , Google , Sony The proposed new Amazon subscription service would go up against the likes of Hulu and Netflix in the US . One option that Amazon is offering its potential media partners is that of subscriptions bundled with the existing Amazon Prime service , which offers US consumers free two-day shipping on most of Amazon 's products for $ 79 ( £50 ) a year . Apple is expected to unveil its latest plans for Apple TV at a press event in Cupertino later today , while both Google and Sony are also looking at ways of delivering ( and monetising ) TV and movie subscription and streaming services . Amazon , CBS , Viacom Time Warner and NBC Universal have all so far declined to comment . According to Adams Media Research online sales and streaming of movies were worth $ 300 million in the US in 2009 , and $ 340 million for TV shows . Via Reuters

Amazon has created a new format for its e-reader , which it is calling Kindle Singles . While the name suggests that it is reading material for all the singletons out there , the format is more for bits of literature which are n't full-blown novels , neither magazine articles . Kindle Singles will be around 30-90 pages in length ( 10,000-30,000 words ) and is for those texts which have added depth . `` Kindle Singles will have their own section in the Kindle Store and be priced much less than a typical book , '' said Amazon in a statement . `` Today 's announcement is a call to serious writers , thinkers , scientists , business leaders , historians , politicians and publishers to join Amazon in making such works available to readers around the world . '' Kindle surprise Amazon also explained that : `` Kindle Singles will be 'Buy Once , Read Everywhere ' , '' noting that `` customers will be able to read them on Kindle , Kindle 3G , Kindle DX , iPad , iPod touch , iPhone , Mac , PC , BlackBerry , and Android-based devices . '' This is part of a whole host of new features for its Kindle Store , including the ability to write your own novel and get it published on the store .

Amazon looks more likely to be bringing out its own Android application portal after email documentation for developers was leaked . Amazon says the store is for 'smartphones and other connected devices ' , meaning the online retailer is clearly gearing up for the tablet onslaught , and could conceivably be creating an Android version of the Kindle too . The email goes on to state that all applications will be reviewed by Amazon before going on the store , but does n't give any more information other than expecting the developers to be familiar with Eclipse , the tool for developing Android applications . At the sharp end But the Wall Street Journal is reporting that there will be a few restrictions imposed by Amazon , including not accepting apps that have been available for more than two weeks before going on the Amazon store . It also will be stipulated that the apps ca n't be offered at a lower price anywhere else either , so Amazon is clearly trying to keep its portal among the application-offering front runners . There 's no word on when the application store will go live , nor what it will be called - but we bet there will be some new hardware to coincide with the new plans . From Engadget

Amazon has announced its 70 per cent royalty offer for UK authors and publishers for its Kindle platform , allowing budding authors and publishers to get their books onto the ebook market and take a cut of the profits . The Digital Text Platform ( DTP ) allows authors to upload their books and make money from the books sold to Kindle and other ebook device owners that can use Amazon 's system . The new royalty system gives authors and publishers five per cent more royalty than the previous DTP deal , bringing it into line with the 70/30 split that Apple applies to the sale of its apps through the iPhone , but does ask for more in return . Make more money ? `` The 70 per cent royalty option for Kindle Digital Text Platform has been available for a few months for sales to US customers , '' said Greg Greeley , Amazon Vice President , European Retail . `` We are excited to be able to announce the launch of the 70 per cent royalty option in the UK . Now authors and publishers worldwide can offer more content to Kindle customers in the UK and make more money from the books they sell . '' Books receiving the 70 per cent royalty option will have access to the same features ( and be under the same rules ) as books on the standard DTP royalty rate . However , there are requirements that must be met by those wanting a slightly larger slice of the pie . `` Delivery costs are based on file size , and pricing is set at £0.10/MB , '' explains Amazon . `` At today 's median DTP file size of 368KB , delivery costs would be less than £0.04 per unit sold . `` For example , on a £5.99 ( VAT exclusive ) book an author would make £2.10 with the standard option and £4.17 with the new 70 per cent option . `` This new option will be in addition to and will not replace the existing DTP standard royalty option .

Last year , Amazon was caught remotely deleting copies of George Orwell 's 1984 from Kindles - and this week it 's deleting even more controversial content . The firm cheerfully deleted erotic stories from people 's Kindle archives , and it cheerfully booted Wikileaks off its hosting service . It 's a strange message for a key cloud computing provider to be giving out : you can rely on us , until you ca n't ! We 'll take care of your stuff , or maybe delete it ! So what 's going on ? In the case of Kindles , people who 've bought incest-themed fiction are finding it disappearing - and as Ars Technica reports , some Amazon reps are then berating customers for their choice of reading matter if they dare to complain . It 's an interesting turnaround for a firm that just weeks ago was resisting calls for censorship of much worse material , and it appears to be a mistake : while distasteful to many , incest-themed fiction is n't illegal . But it illustrates a bigger concern : why do Kindles need a remote kill switch in the first place ? Bookshop staff ca n't come into your house and take books back from your shelves . Why should Amazon be able to do the electronic equivalent ? Disappearing on a whim And then there 's Wikileaks . Amazon flatly denies that it booted the site off its servers following pressure by the US government , although few people believe that . In a statement the firm essentially says that it does n't approve of what Wikileaks is doing . It argues that Wikileaks does n't own the data it 's publishing , and that publishing the data is dangerous - but do you think Amazon would be so zap-happy if it were , say , the New York Times publishing the same information from the same servers ? It 's an interesting contrast to Google 's cloud-happy presentation last week , where CEO Eric Schmidt talked about a constantly-connected world where everything you need would live on someone else 's servers . I do n't recall him waxing lyrical about remote deletion of content you already own , or governments having a quiet word to make things they do n't approve of disappear . The problem with the cloud is that it 's owned and operated by faraway firms whose T & Cs give them the power to do pretty much what they like - so if they decide you should n't be reading about getting it on with Auntie Mabel they can reach into your device and delete it ; if they decide they do n't want to upset a politician or a tabloid they can make controversial content vanish . The cloud is n't ours . It 's theirs . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Liked this ?

Amazon.co.uk has launched its version of the Amazon Windowshop – a 'complete rewrite ' of the site specifically for the Apple iPad . Amazon.co.uk is , as you already know , the UK version of the online merchant giant 's operation , and it has now created a specially tailored version of the site for iPads , following in the footsteps of its US big brother . Amazon Windowshop boasts a '' fluid user interaction…made possible by the iPad 's responsive , multi-touch interface '' , which Amazon is hoping will tempt Apple fans into a late Christmas spree .

Amazon UK is blaming a weekend outage on hardware failure its European data center network . Many Brits were unable to do their online pre-Xmas shopping on Amazon.co.uk this weekend due to the outage , with some suggesting the website had been attacked by 'Anonymous ' as part of a strategic response to Amazon refusing to host Wikileaks in the US recently . Amazon goes down `` The brief interruption to our European retail sites earlier today was due to hardware failure in our European datacenter network and not the result of a DDOS attempt , '' a spokeswoman for Amazon told Reuters . The 4chan activists ( or 'hacktivists ' as some are referring to them ) operating under the name 'Anonymous ' had quickly called for an online attack on Amazon following the retailer pulling the plug on Wikileaks ' US hosting . Amazon.co.uk , amazon.de , amazon.fr and amazon.es were all down for more than 30 minutes until around 2145 GMT on Sunday 12 December . Amazon.com 's US website was not affected by the outage . Anonymous has now claimed that it plans to focus on distributing Wikileaks ' leaked cables rather than taking down websites . Shop till you drop Amazon announced that all its servers are now back up and running `` While it is indeed possible that Anonymous may not have been able to take Amazon.com down in a DDoS attack , this is not the only reason the attack never occurred , '' read a statement which appeared to be sent from Anonymous . `` After the attack was so advertised in the media , we felt that it would affect people such as consumers in a negative way and make them feel threatened by Anonymous . `` Simply put , attacking a major online retailer when people are buying presents for their loved ones would be in bad taste . '' For its part , WikiLeaks has said of the Anonymous attacks : `` we neither condemn nor applaud these attacks '' . Via BBC News

Wikileaks has been removed from Amazon 's cloud computing servers , following the latest batch of high-profile leaks of US diplomatic messages . However , the move will not affect the online distribution of the diplomatic cable files , which are now being shared via Bittorrent . Cablegate concerns Wikileaks so-called `` cablegate '' file containing the leaked diplomatic files is already being widely distributed via Bittorrent , being shared by thousands of users directly online . Wikileaks is moving its hosting back to the Bahnhof ISP in Sweden , according to DNS checking . WikiLeaks confirmed the move from Amazon 's server on its Twitter feed this week . `` WikiLeaks servers at Amazon ousted , '' read the post . `` Free speech the land of the free -- fine our $ are now spent to employ people in Europe . '' Another Twitter message from WikiLeaks read : `` If Amazon are so uncomfortable with the first amendment , they should get out of the business of selling books . '' U.S . Senator Joe Lieberman said of Amazon 's move : `` I wish that Amazon had taken this action earlier based on WikiLeaks ' previous publication of classified material . `` The company 's decision to cut off WikiLeaks now is the right decision and should set the standard for other companies WikiLeaks is using to distribute its illegally seized material . '' Wikileaks now appears to be back online Via CNN.com

Amazon has reached an agreement to buy the share of LoveFilm it did n't already own . In 2008 , LoveFilm bought Amazon 's UK and German DVD rental business and German markets and as a result Amazon became the largest shareholder of LoveFilm . `` LoveFilm has been innovating on behalf of movie rental customers across Europe for many years and with the advent of the LoveFilm player , they are further delighting customers by streaming digital movies for their immediate enjoyment , '' said Greg Greeley , Amazon 's Vice President of European Retail . `` LoveFilm and Amazon have enjoyed a strong working relationship since LoveFilm acquired Amazon Europe 's DVD rental business in 2008 , and we look forward to a productive and innovative future . '' Amazon has already got a strong connection with LoveFilm . But it is the digital arm which is bound to be the most lucrative in the coming years and this is what Amazon has surely got its sights on . Deal is a winner Simon Calver , Chief Executive of LoveFilm International , said about the news : `` The deal is a winner for the members who love LoveFilm because of its value , choice , convenience and innovation in home entertainment . `` With Amazon 's unequivocal support we can significantly enhance our members experience across Europe . '' The actual amount of remaining shares bought to have the total company control was a cool 58 per cent , with the Guardian believing that this means Amazon has spent £200 million on the service .

Amazon has revealed that its Kindle app is now available from the Mac App Store , the relatively new application store for Apple computers . The Kindle app may feel more at home on a portable device , but it seems that it is popular on other devices too , being that it is already the fifth most popular app on the store . Amazon has been strengthening its Kindle brand for some time now . The physical ebook reader is the best-selling product ever on Amazon and its app has found its way onto many a mobile device . Kindle on fire It was rumoured in December 2010 that a web version of the Kindle Store was just around the corner , which would give the service ubiquity . However , it is still app-bound for now , with the Apple version offering everything you expect from the ebook service – over 775,000 books and counting . Of course , Macs have had access to the Kindle service since last year but it has now been given a home on the Mac App Store and can lay claim to being the first ebook reader available on Jobs ' shiny new service .

A security specialist has said that he has worked out a way of breaking the password protection on Wi-Fi networks using Amazon 's Web Services cloud . German security specialist Thomas Roth claims to be able to break into protected wireless networks using specialist code he has written that runs on Amazon 's cloud-based computers . Roth 's code tests 400,000 potential passwords per second using Amazon 's computers . Amazon has yet to comment on the use of its tech for such a security breach . Black Hat hackers Roth plans to distribute his code to the public at the Black Hat hacking conference in the US later this month . The hacker wants to teach network admins that the commonly used encryption method known as WPA-PSK is essentially redundant . Ross was using Amazon 's powerful computers leased by relatively inexpensive per minute rates over the web to crack the passwords . Amazon charges users 28 cents a minute to use the machines Roth deployed in his attack . `` Once you are in , you can do everything you can do if you are connected to the network , '' said the hacker . `` People tell me there is no possible way to break WPA , or , if it were possible , it would cost you a ton of money to do so , '' he added . `` But it is easy to brute force them .

Amazon is offering US subscribers to its Prime delivery service the chance to stream movies and TV shows from the site for no extra cost . Prime subscribers , who pay $ 79 ( £48 ) a year for unlimited two-day delivery on items purchased from Amazon.com , will now get access to a portion of Amazon 's Instant Video library . The Prime eligible library features 5,000 movies and TV shows that can be streamed instantly to a range of devices . No UK love ? While Amazon also offers Prime subscriptions to UK users , there 's no news yet on whether it 'll be offering UK customers the same perks . Amazon does n't offer VoD on Amazon.co.uk at present , but with the entire LOVEFiLM library now at it 's disposal , perhaps it 's something the company will look at in the future . Netflix-baiter The US-only offer is aimed at battling the all-conquering Netflix streaming service , which has apps on Xbox 360 , PS3 , Apple TV , iPhone , iPad and pretty much every connected TV or set-top box . Netflix offers unlimited streaming and a massive library of titles for just $ 8 a month - that 's $ 96 ( £60 ) a year . Amazon 's Prime-eligible library is smaller , but will hope that the lure of fast-free delivery on all items in its inventory will be enough to pinch a few customers away .

Amazon is reportedly 'aggressively ' courting the four main music publishers to be part of its online music store , but the chairman of one of Sony 's music publishing companies has accused the retail giant of mounting 'another land grab ' . Amazon launched its iTunes competitor on Tuesday , but the talk of the music town is that major labels were left a little nonplussed by the lack of warning . However , according to the Wall Street Journal , who have spoken to 'people familiar to the matter ' Amazon is now mounting a speedy charm offensive to win back the key players in the music industry . Major labels The four major labels are Sony Music Entertainment , EMI Group , Warner Music group and Universal Music Group – and a successful music store would need to have the majority if not all of them on board to become a genuine challenger to Apple 's hugely popular , and also widely disliked , iTunes . However , at least one section of Sony is not happy with Amazon , with the managing director of Sony/ATV Music Publishing ( the joint venture involving Michael Jackson 's estate ) making his feelings clear . `` This is just another land grab , '' Martin Bandier told the WSJ . `` I ca n't make it any plainer than that . It 's really disrespectful , and of course we are considering all of our options . '' Via Wall Street Journal

Amazon Appstore , the new Android store that 's just for the US at the moment , is offering up a new try before you buy scheme to entice users into buying more apps . The Appstore has already managed to bag Angry Birds Rio as an exclusive , and it hopes to offer a free 'paid-for ' app a day , but it is the 'test drive now ' feature that is what is piquing developers ' interests . Cooling off , heating up Google used to have a 24-hour cooling off period on the Market , so users could get their money back if they did n't like an app . With the re-design of the store , this was cut to just 15 mins . The Amazon Appstore is trying a more user-friendly approach . Load up Test Drive and you will be able to test the functionality of an app right there on the Appstore . `` Clicking the 'test drive now ' button launches a copy of this app on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) , a web service that provides on-demand compute capacity in the cloud for developers , '' said Amazon . `` When you click on the simulated phone using your mouse , we send those inputs over the Internet to the app running on Amazon EC2 — just like your mobile device would send a finger tap to the app . Our servers then send the video and audio output from the app back to your computer . `` All this happens in real time , allowing you to explore the features of the app as if it were running on your mobile device . '' The Amazon Appstore UK release date has not yet been announced , but it ca n't come quick enough for us .
So much for Apple 's much-rumoured , cloud-based music service : Amazon 's beaten it to the punch with Cloud Drive , Cloud Player for Web and Cloud Player for Android . Apple 's own iTunes cloud service is expected later this year . We know that Google 's currently using Google Music internally , so a release of that must be imminent . Spotify 's been streaming music forever . And Microsoft ... Where the hell is Microsoft ? I 'm beginning to think Microsoft has given up on home entertainment , Xbox games aside . Microsoft already has a digital locker in the form of Windows Live SkyDrive - 25GB of space for photos , videos and documents for free - but nobody seems to have thought `` hey ! This would be ace for music ! '' Let 's face it , all that Amazon 's really offering here is a bit of free storage and a media player . Microsoft could bash that out in a tea break . There appears to be a bit of a problem with the vision thing . Maybe Microsoft needs someone who can tell which way the wind 's blowing , like the chap who spoke about Blu-ray in 2005 : `` Understand that this is the last physical format there will ever be , '' he said . `` Everything 's going to be streamed directly or on a hard disk . '' His name ? Bill Gates . Ahead in the clouds Bill Gates was right , of course . As networks get faster and our mobile devices smarter , the idea of stuffing our entire entertainment collection into a single device is going to seem increasingly silly . Our devices will act as windows , enabling us to see and stream our stuff wherever we happen to be . Streaming music is beginning to look awfully like the ebook market . It 's not hard to imagine Amazon and Apple battling for first place , with Google trailing behind and a couple of niche players fighting over table scraps . One of those niche players is likely to be Microsoft , whose Zune Pass is hardly setting the Xbox alight ; another will probably be Spotify , which still has n't launched in the US . Spotify 's problem appears to be the record companies : while Sony and EMI are on board , the other big players are n't . Google 's probably facing similar issues , and I suspect the reason Microsoft 's Zune Pass is so pricey - around $ 15 per month for streaming - is because it 's trying to keep the record companies happy . That makes Amazon 's service really interesting , because it does n't have the labels ' support : the WSJ says Sony for one is `` disappointed '' that Amazon has launched an `` unlicensed '' service . Amazon says it does n't need a licence , because a digital locker is no different to an external hard disk . It 's an interesting argument that 's currently being debated by lawyers : MP3.com 's Michael Robertson used it to justify his MP3tunes digital locker service , which is currently being dragged through the US courts by EMI . It 's interesting to see Amazon take an identical approach - and it 's also interesting to see that one of Robertson 's key supporters is Google . What we 're seeing here is a war on two fronts : we have tech firms battling with record companies to work out how the future of music will be delivered and who pays what , and we have tech firms battling one another to be the iTunes of streaming music . And unless something big happens soon , we have Microsoft conceding another market to Amazon and Apple .
Amazon.com has announced three cloud-based music services ; Amazon Cloud Drive , Amazon Cloud Player for Web and Amazon Cloud Player for Android , However there 's no word as yet on a UK release date for the Cloud Player - like the UK version of the Appstore , could an announcement be some way off ? Together , these services enable customers to securely store music in the cloud and play it on any Android phone , Android tablet or a Mac or PC regardless of location . Amazon says that you 'll be able to upload your music library to Amazon Cloud Drive and that you start with 5 GB of storage for free . As well as the US , the Cloud Storage is available in the UK and Ireland as well as various other European countries . In the US only , if you purchase an Amazon MP3 album you 'll be upgraded to 20 GB of Cloud Drive space , again for free . New Amazon MP3 purchases saved directly to Cloud Drive are stored for free and do not count against the storage quota . If you need more space , you can purchase storage plans starting at $ 20 a year for 20 GB . Original bit rate Files can be stored in AAC or MP3 formats and will be uploaded to Cloud Drive in the original bit rate . Customers can hand-pick particular songs , artists , albums or playlists to upload or simply upload their entire music library . `` We 're excited to take this leap forward in the digital experience , '' said Bill Carr , vice president of Movies and Music at Amazon . `` The launch of Cloud Drive , Cloud Player for Web and Cloud Player for Android eliminates the need for constant software updates as well as the use of thumb drives and cables to move and manage music . '' `` Our customers have told us they do n't want to download music to their work computers or phones because they find it hard to move music around to different devices , '' Carr said . `` Now , whether at work , home , or on the go , customers can buy music from Amazon MP3 , store it in the cloud and play it anywhere . '' Cloud Player for Web and Android Music can be listened through Cloud Player on any browser . Cloud Player for Web currently supports Internet Explorer , Firefox , Safari for Mac , and Chrome and the player lets you manage your music with various download and streaming options . Amazon MP3 customers can continue to use iTunes and Windows Media Player to add their music to their iPods and MP3 players . Cloud Player for Android is bundled into the new version of the Amazon MP3 App ; it includes the full Amazon MP3 Store and the mobile version of Cloud Player . Customers can use the app to play music stored on their Cloud Drive and music stored locally on their device . Features include the ability to search and browse by artist , album or song , create playlists and download music from Cloud Drive . All files uploaded to Amazon 's cloud are securely backed up on Amazon Simple Storage Service ( Amazon S3 ) . Cloud Drive allows customers to upload and store all kinds of digital files ; music , photos , videos and documents can be stored securely and are available via web browser on any computer .

Amazon has explained to TechRadar that its Android Appstore will remain inaccessible to people in the UK for now , with no news on global launches for the store . Interest is high in the Appstore , with Apple opening legal proceedings over the use of the name and movie/gaming hybrid Angry Bird Rio launching on the store . However , UK people trying to access the store will be redirected back to Amazon 's home page , with Amazon telling us that there was no news on when that would change . Global business `` We are launching now in the US , however we are a global business and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to do what 's in the best interest of our customers , '' said a spokesperson . `` At this time , we have not announced plans on international launches . '' Amazon has attracted criticism in the past for its narrow focus on its dominant US market , particularly over the celebrated Kindle ebook reader . And the decision to limit access to the Appstore is likely to prove another unpopular move for the retail giant .
Amazon has launched its Android Appstore – but much of the talk has been about Apple suing the online retailer over the name rather than the arrival of Angry Birds Rio . According to US sources , the Appstore is now available , although TechRadar has found links to the store are redirecting back to the Amazon.com homepage at the current time . The store will offer users of Google 's Android mobile operating system a host of apps , including an exclusive on Angry Birds Rio ( for a time ) . Un-appy However , Apple is far from happy that Amazon has chose the moniker Appstore , which it considers is too closed to the App Store term it uses and is currently fighting to keep its trademark on against Microsoft . According to newswire Bloomberg a complaint has been issued by the Cupertino-based giant . `` Amazon has begun improperly using Apple 's App Store mark in connection with Amazon 's mobile-software developer program , '' Apple said in the complaint . The company had previously asked Amazon to not use the term for its sale of mobile applications . Via Engadget , Bloomberg

Amazon is yet to launch the Amazon Appstore , but an enterprising blogger has stumbled across what seems to have been the app site , complete with pricing . Being savvy appstore fans , AndroidNews.de swiftly screengrabbed all the icons and pricing on show and shared them with the internet . Sadly Amazon got wise to this loophole and quickly removed the site –http : //www.amazon.com/apps simply takes you to the Amazon homepage now . Amazonian apps The site listed 48 apps , including SwiftKey , WolframAlpha and the charmingly-named Moron Test , while all app prices were listed in US dollars ranging from $ 0.89 ( 55p ) to $ 9.99 ( around £6 ) . Some apps were listed as costing less than they do in the Android Market – for example the popular retro camera app Vignette , which is $ 4.02 ( £2.40 ) in the Android Market and only $ 2.99 ( £1.80 ) on Amazon 's app page , according to AndroidNews . There 's no guarantee that these are the official final prices and app line-up from Amazon 's app store venture – we 'll have to wait and see when the site officially launches , which could be any day now .

Rovio has announced through Twitter and its blog that it will be launching its Angry Birds spin-off , Angry Birds Rio , exclusively through the Amazon Appstore . Like it did with GetJar , Rovio has decided to sell another Angry Birds game not through the official Android Market but a third-party site . The Amazon Appstore has yet to launch but the Angry Birds Rio UK release date is 22 March , so it 's a given that Amazon will open up its app shop before this . Look mum , no ads ! Interestingly , Angry Birds Rio will be a paid-for app . When GetJar had exclusive rights to Angry Birds Seasons for Android , it was offering the game for free but with ads . This is n't the case for Angry Birds Rio , even though Rovio will be getting a fair bit of cash from Twentieth Century Fox , as the game is a tie-in for the upcoming Rio animated film . Alongside Angry Birds Rio , the Amazon Appstore will also get paid versions of Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons . This is the first time Android users will be able to play the apps ad-free . `` The Android platform has seen phenomenal growth , and it 's great that new avenues for app distribution are opening up , '' explained CEO Mikael Hed on the Rovio blog . `` The openness of the Android platform works for the benefit of consumers and developers alike . It has been delightful to team up with Amazon to bring the Angry Birds franchise to this great new application marketplace . ''
Amazon has been revealed as the `` best-value brand '' on the planet . This is according to a study by Millward Brown , a research agency that specialises in advertising and marketing communications . Amazon tops both the global and the UK list , with toothpaste manufacturer Colgate coming second . A brand apart In the global list there are a total of three tech brands . Alongside Amazon , Nokia resides in third place and Microsoft is in seventh . In the UK , there 's also three technology companies , with eBay replacing Nokia and Microsoft rising to third . Peter Walshe , global BrandZ director at Millward Brown , said about the study : `` What is needed is a balance between the consumer 's desire for a brand and the price they are prepared to pay for it . `` This new report will help brands to see where there is a shortfall and how to increase sales potential . '' Amazon announced recently that it has started selling the Amazon Kindle in bricks-and-mortar shops , with Carphone Warehouse and Best Buy stocking the device . Via Mad.co.uk

Amazon 's yet to launch third-party app store , known as the Amazon Appstore , will not be limited to the Android OS , a spokesperson has confirmed . Speaking to Mobile-Device.biz , Aaron Rubenson , leader of the Appstore project , said that the market will eventually cater to users on numerous operating systems . He said , `` Our goal is to provide a vast selection to customers from multiple operating systems . Although the store will feature Android apps at launch , we will evaluate opportunities to expand our selection on an ongoing basis . '' Recommendation engine The Amazon Appstore is also aiming to make finding good apps a darn sight easier than on handset storefronts . It will use Amazon 's recommendations engine to send users off on a path of app discovery , using familiar Amazon features like `` People Who Bought This Also Bought '' . But whether or not it can ever make it to all-encompassing one-stop app shop will depend on its ability to add apps from more closed-off operating systems , like iOS . No one is really sure when the Amazon Appstore will officially launch , although rumours suggest the US will get it later this month . Hopefully the UK will soon follow suit .

Amazon has reported a tumble in its profits for the first quarter of 2011 , down by a third compared to the same period last year . It 's not all doom and gloom for the international sales behemoth , however , with sales of £6 billion and international sales up by 31 per cent . Ebooks were among Amazon 's most popular products of the quarter , with one print book and four ebooks in its top 10 bestselling items and the Kindle its top-selling product . Burning a hole So where 's all that extra money going ? It 's being invested into new products and technologies , including the Kindle e-reader , Amazon smartphone apps , Amazon 's in-house appstore and , potentially , a tablet device of its own . Christopher North , Managing Director of Amazon.co.uk said of the results , `` This is a strong quarter for amazon.co.uk ; for the first time we are seeing our other segments such as grocery and clothing push up sales . `` We predict growth to continue around 35-40 per cent in Q2 thanks to investments in new technologies and innovations .

Amazon 's EC2 service has suffered a major problem , taking a host of big name companies like Quora and FourSquare down with it . Amazon 's Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) is used as a platform by several major companies , and the company 's outage has therefore created some major waves . Quora , Hootsuite and FourSquare have all been affected , with Amazon confirming that a datacentre in North Virginia is the hub of the trouble . Latencies `` We can confirm connectivity errors impacting EC2 instances and increased latencies impacting EBS volumes in multiple availability zones in the US-EAST-1 region . Increased error rates are affecting EBS CreateVolume API calls , '' said Amazon 's statement . `` We continue to work towards resolution . '' Amazon 's EC2 has been a big hit for the company , giving businesses the chance to elastically expand their companies with the demand . This is a major boon to companies that grow rapidly , or who experience big spikes of traffic , but obviously reliability is therefore a key issue . Via RCR Unplugged

Amazon has announced that users of its Kindle devices and smartphone apps will be able to 'borrow ' ebooks from their local libraries . Library Lending is a US-based offering which will let users check-out digital titles from 11,000 libraries across America , free of charge . While this is a very cool way to incorporate libraries into the ebook revolution , cooler still is the fact that any annotations you make will be retained if you borrow the book again or buy it from the Kindle store . Whispersync friendly Amazon Kindle Director Jay Marine says : `` We 're doing a little something extra here , '' Marine continued . `` Normally , making margin notes in library books is a big no-no . `` But we 're extending our Whispersync technologyso that you can highlight and add margin notes to Kindle books you check out from your local library . `` Your notes will not show up when the next patron checks out the book . But if you check out the book again , or subsequently buy it , your notes will be there just as you left them , perfectly Whispersynced . '' Multi-platform The service , which will launch later this year , will be powered by OverDrive , who arranged a similar deal for Sony 's fading Reader devices . Library Lending will work across the entire range of Kindle apps , including iPhone , Android , BlackBerry , Nokia , Windows Phone 7 as well as Macs and PCs . While we applaud Amazon for this move , how about giving a little bit of love to the UK ? We had to wait forever for the Kindle to begin with , just like the MP3 store . We still do n't have the Amazon Android Appstore and there does n't appear to be any obvious plans to extend the library link-up beyond the US either .

Amazon is looking to introduce NFC payments into its service , so users can purchase goods from Amazon while browsing for them in real shops . NFC is the technology of choice at the moment , so its no wonder a big e-tailer like Amazon is looking to get in on the wireless payment action . Just how Amazon will use the technology is unclear , but Bloomberg is reporting that it is considering the technology but has n't begun talking about it in public yet . Perhaps this could be the start of the Amazon high street presence we heard about 18 months ago ? Wireless communication Just this week it was announced that NFC will be integrated into future Windows Phone devices , with this likely to come in an update to the Windows Phone 7 OS . Samsung is the biggest flag waver of NFC at the moment , with the technology integrated into the Nexus S . Amazon is getting heavily into the mobile game at the moment . It recently introduced the Amazon Appstore , a rival to Google 's Android Market .

Amazon 's much-rumoured Android tablet ( or family of tablets , depending on who you believe ) is set to launch as a 10-inch model , with a 7-inch sibling also on its way . PCMag cites sources in Taipei as revealing that the retailing giant originally wanted the tablet to be able to switch between an E-ink-style reading display and a colour LCD screen . Although this kind of screen is in development by a number of manufacturers , there 's very little chance it will hit the market before 2013 . In the meantime , Amazon 's Android family will don LCD screens , as well as offering an Nvidia Tegra quad-core processor . Honeycomber There 's still no clue from any of the anonymous sources as to which version of Android the tablets will launch with – we imagine Android 3.1 will be the preference over Android 3.0 – but all the pundits seem quite agreed on the fact that it will launch in time for the Christmas retail rush . Amazon seems to be the great white Android tablet hope , with existing Honeycomb offerings failing to set the world alight with passion and even Android darlings HTC struggling to offer the complete package . It 's not hard to see why ; Amazon has everything on its side for a successful tablet : marketing reach to hit millions of customers , the coffers to offer a competitively priced tablet and even its own Android app store .

Amazon has announced that it now sells more Kindle ebooks than all print books – that 's hardcover and paperback combined – through the Amazon.com site . Introduced less than four years ago , the Kindle has quickly become Amazon 's top selling product , and now digitised books for the reader have become more popular with its customers than their paper and ink fore-runners . In the UK , we 're still a little more attached to the humble tome , with Amazon.co.uk still selling more printed books than ebooks – although the Kindle versions are out-selling hardcover books two to one . That 's including all hardcover books that are n't available on Kindle , and excluding all free Kindle books – Amazon says if these were included , the number would be `` even higher '' . Kindle love `` This is truly astonishing when you consider that we 've been selling hardcover books from Amazon.co.uk for over 13 years and Kindle books for only nine months , '' said Gordon Willoughby , European Director , Kindle . If one wanted to play devil 's advocate , one could argue that this is n't all that impressive ; surely existing Amazon customers are more likely to buy a Kindle and Kindle owners can only buy their ebooks from Amazon , so it 's no surprise that Kindle books are doing well - whereas the rest of the world is free to buy their paper books from wherever they fancy and Amazon would never know about it… but that could just be the bitter bibliophile inside us . Either way it 's an impressive feat for such a young format ; how long before the UK 's Kindle sales over take print altogether ? Amazon.co.uk wo n't tell us the ratio of Kindle sales to paperback sales , but if it keeps up its aggressive Kindle marketing , we 'd wager not long at all .

Rather than just an Android tablet , online megastore Amazon may have a family of Android devices up its sleeve . With the Kindle e-reader having proven a huge success for the company – it was its top selling product of the last quarter – it came as no surprise to anyone when fairly solid rumours of an Amazon tablet began to swirl . But now it seems that Amazon is preparing a whole host of Android devices for launch later this year , according to an insider speaking to Android And Me . Kindledroid Adding credence to the rumours is the fact that Amazon recently launched a dedicated Android app store , which as a stand-alone launch seems a little bit haphazard of the company . The anonymous sources also said that Amazon will use a Pixel Qi display for low-power consumption . It 's not clear whether Amazon is working on just tablets or some smartphones too – nor do we have any clues on what version of Android we 're looking at ; but we 'd expect a level of customisation a la HTC Sense rather than raw Android . But one thing 's for sure : we wo n't be surprised to see at least one Amazon Android tablet hit the virtual shelves in time for Christmas . Via Android and Me

For all the talk of iPad killers over the last year or so , there 's no such thing . Rather than iPad killers we 've seen a lot of iPad-a-likes , disappointing devices that have been designed to do much the same as the iPad does . Only one firm is spanking Apple in the portable media market , and it does n't even make tablets . Yet . I 'm talking about Amazon , whose Kindle is the most Apple-y thing I 've owned that Apple did n't actually make . The buying experience , the packaging , the process of buying books and reading them is all Apple all the way : it just works , brilliantly . Amazon understands what the iPad-a-likes do n't : it 's not about horsepower , or a pretty case , or cutting-edge anything . It 's about delivering an experience that delights people , and having an enormous amount of stuff people can download to their shiny new toy . I ca n't wait to see what it does with a tablet . Here comes trouble The Amazon Kindle Fire is incoming . According to Digitimes , Taiwanese notebook firm Quanta Computer `` has recently received OEM orders from Amazon for its reported tablet PC and the device will also receive full support [ from ] E Ink holdings for supplying touch panels . '' So there you go . A touch-screen Kindle tablet . If you look at the reviews of iPad rivals , they tend to fall down in two areas . They deliver a disappointing user experience , or they do n't have much content , or both . We know that Amazon can nail the user experience , and we know that Amazon has got a really big hard disk with lots of things on it - including an Android App Store- and a fast , simple payment system millions of people trust . Apps , music , movies , books , newspapers ... if it can be digitised , Amazon delivers it , and it delivers it exceptionally well . The Kindle 's web browser is crappy , sure , and the music player is basic to say the least , but people do n't buy Kindles to browse the web or listen to MP3s . They buy it for the thing it 's absolutely brilliant at : buying , downloading and reading books . If Amazon can make a tablet that 's as good with music , movies and Angry Birds , it 'll sell millions . Where other rivals ' devices take the iPad as a starting point , their sales pitch essentially `` hey ! Buy our tablet ! It 's like an iPad , honest ! `` , Amazon could take a completely different angle . `` You thought the Kindle was awesome ? '' Amazon could ask . `` Wait until you see this ! ''
Amazon is looking to release an iPad 2 rival in the second half of 2011 , with the e-tailer putting in a massive OEM order to Quanta Computers . This is according to DigiTimes who notes that the new device is likely to come with Fringe Field Switching ( FFS ) technology and and electrophoretic display ( EPD ) and will have its touchscreen created by E Ink Holdings . As all of these technologies are pointing to another ( possibly colour and definitely touchscreen ) e-reader launch , it will be interesting to see if this is a true rival to the iPad 2 . According to the report , 700,000-800,000 monthly units have been ordered and should be shipping in the latter half of 2011 . From e-reader to tablet Amazon revolutionised the ebook market with the Amazon Kindle , which has been the company 's best-selling device since launch . But with all its success , the e-reader is no match for the iPad 2 , so Amazon will be hoping its un-yet-named tablet will make a dent in the iPad 's sales or at least more of an impression that the Galaxy Tab and other rivals . Alongside the tablet 's launch it is thought that Amazon will reduce the price of the Kindle . For Quanta , the order is a huge money maker . DigiTimes believes that the contracts could be worth as much as £2 billion . Via DigiTimes

Junk email ? That 's so yesterday ; it 's all about the e-book publishing spam these days , with the Amazon Kindle self-publishing platform proving to be a spammers ' paradise . The work of legitimate aspiring authors is getting swamped by Private Label Rights ( PLR ) work – prose that is available to be picked up cheaply ( or freely ) by anyone online . Spammers and those looking to make a quick buck are reformatting these rights-free works into ebooks and sticking them up for sale around 99 cents ( 60p ) using the Kindle Direct Publishing platform - and some are even selling books and DVDs to educate others in how to do it . The man who would be Kindle Not only is it irritating if you accidentally buy one of these PLR works , but this influx of spammy ebooks makes it harder than ever to find something worth reading . Another sneaky money-spinning trick infiltrating the book platform is the copying and republishing of ebooks that are already proving popular , using a different title and cover . One element making the platform so attractive to spammers is that distributing a work using the Kindle Direct Publishing service does n't cost anything ; Amazon simply takes a cut if you make any sales . With plagiarism and spam-like content taking over , questions will no doubt be raised over whether Amazon needs to police the self-publishing platform more aggressively , or remove it altogether .

Amazon 's latest financial results have underlined the rude health of the internet giant , with sales of the Kindle ereader 'accelerating ' . Although net income fell to 41 cents a share year on year , Amazon 's quarterly results were better than analysts had predicted and sales have soared by 51 per cent compared to 2010 . Amazon stated that the Kindle ebook reader has been a key seller , although it did not drill down into figures besides saying that the sales accelerated compared to the first quarter of this year . Innovation driving `` Low prices , expanding selection , fast delivery and innovation are driving the fastest growth we 've seen in over a decade , '' said Jeff Bezos , founder and CEO of Amazon.com . `` Kindle 3G with Special Offers has quickly become our bestselling Kindle… Customers love the convenience of a 3G reader - no hunting for or paying for Wi-Fi hotspots . Amazon picks up the tab for the 3G wireless , so you have no monthly payments or annual contracts . '' Amazon also pointed to the launch of Kindle Textbook rental and the 950,000 books now available on the Kindle store as boosting the ereader 's success .

UPDATE : Earlier this week we reported that the Cosmo Black Nintendo3DS was unavailable to buy on Amazon . Amazon has since given the following reason for this inventory glitch to Engadget : `` We received customer feedback that there may be an inventory issue with the Cosmo Black Nintendo 3DS . The integrity of the product is not under review . Customers are still able to purchase the Amazon.com offer of the Aqua Blue Nintendo 3DS , however the Amazon.com offer of [ the ] black Nintendo 3DS has been removed until the inventory issue is resolved . There is no problem with the Cosmo Black Nintendo 3DS units themselves . This is an internal inventory problem that was brought to our attention from customer feedback and we are looking into it and will resolve as soon as possible . '' -- -- -- -- -- The Nintendo 3DS has been pulled from Amazon 's US website and been placed 'Under Review ' . This means that customers wo n't be able to purchase the console direct from Amazon.com , although some marketplace sellers are still offering it . It 's not clear exactly what the problem is , but it seems that a large number of customer complaints have prompted the temporary ( for now ) sales ban . 3DS under review Amazon.com visitors looking to pick up a 3DS see the following message : `` While this item is available from other marketplace sellers on this page , it is not currently offered by Amazon.com because customers have told us there may be something wrong with our inventory of the item , the way we are shipping it , or the way it 's described here . `` We 're working to fix the problem as quickly as possible .

Amazon is set to release its Game Download Store in the UK in October , according to the latest reports . The PC game download shopfront , which has been live in the US since February 2009 , is said to be currently in the testing phase on our fair shores and heading towards a full rollout in autumn . According to MCV 's sources , the UK version of the store was meant to open in April 2011 , but has been subject to delays for undisclosed reasons . Gaming mecca The Game Download Store in the US began life as a casual gaming vendor , but has recently started selling the bigger hitters for serious gamers in download form . The Amazon service is part of a growing industry of digital game distribution , with Steam still serving as the granddaddy of the bunch . Amazon wo n't be abandoning physical gaming , however , with the current US version of the store offering either the digital or boxed edition to customers . Given the long wait since the US store launch , the rise of casual gaming and the reliability of MCV as a publication , we 'd say this is a fairly solid rumour and rate it highly on the TechRadar rumourometer : From MCV

The much rumoured Amazon tablet is to make an appearance this year , with the iPad rival reportedly set to make an appearance this October . It 's easy to see why Amazon has an eye on the tablet market . Its ereader , the Amazon Kindle was a runaway success and is still the number one product bought on its store . This type of business model seems to work and it 's likely that Amazon wo n't change it for the launch of tablet – which means it will probably get a US release first , with the UK market to follow . Tablet talk For a tablet to work properly , it needs an eco-system and Amazon has this with the Amazon Appstore and its close links with LoveFilm . With all the apps on the Appstore currently based on Android , it makes sense that it would use the Android Honeycomb OS and offer a direct link to its own Appstore ( which seems to be getting a number of exclusive apps ) and the original Android Market . The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Amazon tablet will have a 9-inch screen and the first model will be outsourced , while a second model will be designed in-house and released later in 2012 . A number of new updates will also be coming to the Kindle , according to the WSJ , including touchscreen controls . The WSJ is keeping its sources close to its heart on this , but as rumours go an Amazon tablet is a rather safe bet .

A judge in the US has ruled that Apple can not stop Amazon from using the term 'appstore ' . According to the ruling in response to Apple 's preliminary injunction request , Apple has not established that Amazon 's use of the term will confuse consumers . Apple does have a trademark pending on the App Store name , however , which may lead to further litigation in the future . The company is already battling Microsoft on the trademark front , with Ballmer 's bunch trying to block the Cupertino crew 's claim on the App Store name . Order in the court Judge Phyllis Hamilton wrote an eighteen-page document giving her opinion on the Amazon matter , saying , `` First , Apple has not established that its `` App Store '' mark is famous , in the sense of being 'prominent ' and 'renowned ' . `` The evidence does show that Apple has spent a great deal of money on advertising and publicity , and has sold/provided/furnished a large number of apps from its App Store , and the evidence also reflects actual recognition of the `` App Store '' mark . `` However , there is also evidence that the term `` app store '' is used by other companies as a descriptive term for a place to obtain software applications for mobile devices . '' Meanwhile , the actual Apple App Store has just sailed past the 15 bililon downloads milestone . A rose by any other name , and all that .

Amazon has registered a new domain name , KindleScribe.com , which could provide clues to what the company 's next hardware launch will entail . The inclusion of the word 'Scribe ' suggests that a Stylus will make an appearance somewhere ; could we be looking at a Kindle that allows you to make handwritten annotations ? After all , the HTC 's stylus-toting tablet , the HTC Flyer , describes its pen-based software with the same word . What 's more , we 're expecting a Kindle upgrade any day now ever since Amazon dropped the US price of the popular ereader in early August . Then again , we 're also eagerly awaiting the launch of Amazon 's much-rumoured tablet ; it 's possible that the retail behemoth will launch it under the Kindle brand , although we think that 's less likely . The Amazon Tablet release date has been mooted as October 2011 , so the timing could very well work . Still , we think an annotatable ereader is the more likely of the options and we await the launch of the KindleScribe.com with growing interest . Fancy a bit more speculation ?

Google has to begun to map the Amazon rainforest and river for its Street View service . Camera teams have been dispatched by boat and in order to bring intimate details the world 's largest tropical rainforest to your desktop . The crews , which include the indigenous peoples of the area , will also seek to capture the living environments of those who inhabit the jungle . `` Once all the images are uploaded to the internet , we can share the local culture and beauty of the Amazon with anyone , anywhere in the world , '' says Karin Tuxen-Bettman , who is leading the team . Without the vision , creativity and dedication of our partners , this endeavour would not be possible . '' The project is being carried out in association with Sustainable Amazon Foundation , which hopes to raise awareness about the rainforest 's plight . Link : Telegraph

Amazon has signed its first author as it attempts to make its mark as a book publishing , as well as a book selling , powerhouse . The company has snagged the services of self-help guru Timothy Ferriss , author of The 4-Hour series , and will publish all of his future works . The first of which , The 4-Hour Chef , will arrive in hardback , audio and , of course , ebook format next spring . Ferriss says that the deal will open a lot of doors for himself and other authors . `` Amazon has a one-to-one relationship with every one of their customers , '' he said . `` You can just imagine the possibilities that opens up . '' `` The opportunity to partner with a technology company that is embracing publishing is very different than partnering with a publisher embracing technology . '' The move allows Amazon to cut out the middle man , something that has angered the traditional publishing houses who believe Amazon Publishing is another attempt to put them out of business . HaperCollins UK CEO Victoria Barnsley reckons the developments are `` obviously a concern '' . She added : `` They are also a very important customer of ours and they have done fantastic things for the book industry . `` I have mixed views about them but there 's no doubt they are very , very powerful now and in fact they are getting close to being in a monopolistic situation . '' Amazon stepped up its efforts to establish itself in the publishing game earlier this year by hiring long-time editor and former CEO and chairman of the Time-Warner Book Group Larry Kirshbaum to head up Amazon Publishing .

Amazon has launched the Kindle Cloud Reader , a web-based ebook application that is `` optimised for iPad '' . It 's a very sneaky way of working around Apple 's new App Store rules that bans iOS apps from linking out to external stores – which meant that Amazon could n't sell any Kindle ebooks to its iPhone and iPad app owners from their devices . But the web app does n't need to jump through the App Store 's hoops . It still allows you to read your new and already-purchased Kindle books in an app-style interface on an iPad or download them for reading offline , but also means you can buy new books direct from the Kindle store . Sadly , iPhone users wo n't be able to take advantage of the web app just yet ; but the fact that Amazon name checks the iPhone on the Cloud Reader homepage gives us hope that there 's an iPhone-compatible version in the works . If Apple 's annoyed about the Kindle Cloud Reader web app , it 'll have to file it under 'quash later ' as it deals with another ebook niggle ; the company has been named in a US lawsuit over ebook price fixing . Filed in San Francisco , the suit accuses Apple of working with major publishers to control pricing , naming Hachette Book Group , HarperCollins , Macmillan , Penguin and Simon & Schuster , which collectively control around 85 per cent of popular fiction and non-fiction titles . Apple and the named publishers have been working an agency pricing model , whereby publishers become the book sellers and Apple takes a slice of the sales ( 30 per cent ) . This means that the publisher-as-bookseller sets the price of a book at whatever it fancies and all other retailers of that ebook have to fall in line ; because Apple takes such a huge chunk of the profit , the pricing is alleged to be higher than it otherwise would be . The lawsuit claims that publishers `` would simply deny Amazon access to the title '' if it tried to sell an ebook at below the publisher-set price . '' It seems that the plaintiffs are very pro-Amazon , with the lawsuit complaint also alleging `` that Apple believed that it needed to neutralise the Kindle when it entered the ebook market with its own e-reader , the iPad , and feared that one day the Kindle might challenge the iPad by digitally distributing other media like music and movies . '' The anti-competitive nature of the agency price model is already under some serious scrutiny in the UK as well , with the Office of Fair Trading investigating the way that ebooks are priced .

A new report by PC Mag is suggesting that Amazon may be ready to take a revenue hit on its new tablet range and could well offer it at a cut price . In what would be a Trojan-Horse-style strategy , PC Mag is suggesting that Amazon could offer the device as a loss maker but make its money back on the apps , music and ebooks you would buy for the product . Amazon has created a pretty strong eco-system over the last year , with the launch of the Amazon Cloud Drive , the Amazon Appstore and in the UK the acquisition of LoveFilm . The Kindle , for all its success – it is still Amazon 's best-ever-selling product – has only really tapped into Amazon 's extensive ebook library , so there is room for the company to launch a fully fledged tablet that makes use of all the goodies Amazon has on offer . As PC Mag says in its report : `` If Amazon provides a product that is sold under cost with the goal of making up the rest of the cost and profit from apps , services , and even advertising , it could give all of the other Android vendors a serious run for their money . '' And if this happens , then we may well have a real battle on our hands in the burgeoning tablet market . Via SlashGear

Amazon is the latest company to be linked to the buyout of Palm , with the e-tailer heavily linked to purchasing the likes of WebOS from HP . Amazon has been busy of late , announcing its first tablet , the Kindle Fire , and both a cheaper and touchscreen variant of its Kindle ebook reader . Given that the Kindle Fire has come packing Android , the idea that the company would want WebOS is an interesting one . HP has said that Amazon would make an ideal partner for WebOS but Amazon has not mentioned whether it would be interested in buying Palm . If it was to buy Palm , and with it WebOS , it would mean the company would avoid any messy Android licensing problems in the future but it would also mean that – due to the fact it has only just announced new products – the company would have to wait at least six months to launch anything with WebOS on it . One fact that is giving this rumour some weight is that former Palm CEO Jon Rubinstein , now at HP as a 'product innovator , is part of Amazon 's board , so will have some clout as to whether Palm is acquired or not . If it were to buy Palm , it would have to dig deep into its pockets – HP paid $ 1.2 billion for the company is 2010 , although its price to a potential buyer will be far lower than this .
Next week will be all about Apple , but this week it 's Amazon 's turn to shine : the firm has unveiled three new bits of Kindle kit that should delight customers and annoy rivals - or at least , they should in the US . For the time being , it seems , the best kit is US-only . When Amazon boss Jeff Bezos took the stage , the word `` tablet '' was on everyone 's lips - but instead of showing off the rumoured Kindleslab , he showed us a brand new Kindle instead . The Kindle Touch keeps the e-ink display that makes e-readers special , but replaces the keyboard with a primitive touchscreen . It 's no iPad , but it 's perfectly capable of spotting finger taps to turn pages and bring up menus including the new X-Ray feature , which downloads relevant content such as explanations of places , terms or events . It 's cheap , too : just $ 99 ( £63 ) for the Wi-Fi version , and $ 150 ( £96 ) for the 3G model . That 's not the cheapest new Kindle , though . That honour goes to the Kindle - there 's no suffix - which is just $ 79 in the US . Unfortunately crossing the Atlantic puts the price up to £89 , although as Amazon told us that 's because the $ 79 version is ad-supported , which is a service that is n't an option over here . When you compare the UK and US prices of the ad-free Kindles , things do n't look so bad : the US price is $ 109 , which works out at around £84 . Once again this Kindle does without a keyboard , although this time there 's no touchscreen : instead , there are a couple of buttons and a four-way joystick . There 's good news and bad news about release dates : while the basic Kindle will arrive on UK doorsteps from the 12th of October , there 's no sign of a release date for the Kindle Touch or the new Kindle tablet , the Kindle Fire . Did we say Kindle tablet ? As Marc Chacksfield explains , `` It 's a 7-inch device that comes with Android , albeit a version that has been heavily altered by Amazon to make the best use of the company 's e-shopping spine . '' Specs are reasonable - dual-core processor , IPS screen with gorilla glass , just 413g in weight - but the real secret is the software , which looks rather like Apple 's Cover Flow . It 's the Amazon Kindle Fire . The excitement moved our columnist Gary Marshall to channel Noddy Holder and burst into song . `` So here it is , Merry Christmas / Everybody 's having fun / Apart from all the Android firms / Who are probably chucking themselves off bridges right now , '' he sang . `` The original was a bit catchier , but you get the gist : unless Amazon 's playing a great big joke and the Kindle Fire is as slow as a snail , then as far as the oh-so-lucrative Christmas shopping period in America is concerned Motorola , RIM , HP and the rest might as well pack up and go home . '' Marshall predicts a two-horse tablet race this Christmas , with Amazon and Apple taking the lion 's share of sales . Can tablets such as the PlayBook compete ? Er , perhaps not , writes Chris Smith . RIM 's Android app support looks disappointing , and `` it 's difficult to see how the PlayBook ... can compete with the Kindle Fire even if the price points were similar . '' The Fire is half the price of RIM 's tablet . As Marshall puts it : `` The Kindle Fire 's going to fly off the shelves in the same way BlackBerry PlayBooks do n't . '' Kindle Fire owners will get two cool things : free cloud-based backup , and WhisperSync for movies and music . WhisperSync is the service that knows where you are in a book and lets you start from where you left off on other devices . Unfortunately , we 're not sure whether UK customers will get these services , as some of Amazon 's US products are n't available over here : its cloud music service has n't launched here yet , and while we can sign up for Amazon 's premium delivery service Prime , we do n't get the free streaming video US prime customers get - even though Amazon owns Lovefilm , which offers a UK video-on-demand service .

Amazon 's US top 100 electronics sales list has shown just how powerful its Kindle brand , with the all but the top offering made up of the various flavours of ebook reader , and the Kindle Fire tablet taking top slot with a bullet . There was little doubt that the newly announced Kindle family would sell well , but even pre-orders have taken the rankings by storm . It is Amazon 's Android tablet the Kindle Fire which dominates ; a $ 200 price point is seen as the key factor , and it looks as if the internet giant has got a smash hit on its hands . Second place goes to the new entry-level special offer Kindle at $ 79 – with the thrift-seeker 's ebook reader clearly catching the eye . The more expensive Kindle Touch offerings are at positions three ( Wi-Fi only ) and four ( 3G ) , and the newly reduced $ 99 dollar old style Kindle – now called Kindle Keyboard is up to number five in the sales charts . In the UK , the only new Kindle to be announced for sale is the keyboard-less new-style Kindle priced at £89 – and it is in at number one , with the £109 Kindle Keyboard Wi-Fi only at number two and the 3G keyboard version at three . We are still haranguing Amazon UK for a UK release date and prices for the Kindle Touch and Kindle Fire but the company has steadfastly refused to give us one just yet . That almost certainly suggests that the UK will not get the first generation products in 2011 .

Amazon 's very proud of its new Silk web browser , which brings Amazon 's mighty backend to the job of speeding up web browsing - so proud , in fact , that it seems the firm plans to bring it to other people 's devices too . Is it a Trojan horse ? I do n't mean that it 's going to give your bank details to Jeff Bezos , because let 's face it , he 's already got those . I mean a Trojan horse in that it 's going to have access to every Kindle Fire 's entire web usage , enabling it to build the kind of data picture that makes Phorm , Google search history or Facebook 's Beacon look like very small potatoes indeed . Here 's how it works : part of the browser lives in the cloud , and when you click a link or enter a URL Amazon will `` take into account things like network conditions , page complexity and the location of any cached content . '' That 's good for you , because it could speed up your browsing , and it 's good for Amazon , because Amazon gets to store details of every single thing you do online . Maybe Jeff Bezos forgot to mention that bit . As Apple employee number 8 , Chris Espinosa has forgotten more about tech than most of us will ever know - so if he 's worried about Silk , we should be too . As he writes on his Posterous blog , `` people who cringe at the data-mining implications of the Facebook timeline ought to be just floored by the magnitude of Amazon 's opportunity here . '' According to Espinosa , `` Amazon now has what every storefront lusts for : the knowledge of what other stores your customers are shopping and what prices they 're being offered there ... in essence the Fire user base is Amazon 's Mechanical Turk , scraping the web for free and providing Amazon with the most valuable cache of user behaviour in existence . '' The security bods at Sophos are n't impressed either : they 've been poring through the Silk privacy policy and they do n't like what they see . The T & Cs note that `` URLs , IP addresses and MAC addresses will be logged and can be retained for 30 days '' , and the FAQ appears to suggest that your secure HTTP traffic will be intercepted too . There is an off-cloud mode , but you can bet that wo n't be particularly prominent . Never mind `` people who bought this book also bought '' : what Amazon 's working on here is a `` people with your symptoms also bought '' , `` people with your perilous financial history also bought '' , `` people with your balloon fetish also bought '' engine . It 's not storing your individual data , but as Don Park comments on Espinosa 's post , `` they do n't have to know who you are , just what you are '' . If the data was n't valuable , Amazon would n't be trying to get it . I ca n't help thinking that Amazon , and Facebook , and Google , and all the other big players are giving us the privacy equivalent of boiling a frog , the ( mythical , apparently ) technique of slowly increasing the heat so that the frog does n't realise it 's being cooked until it 's far too late . Last week Facebook had its hand on the gas ; this week , it 's Amazon . Who 's next ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
Amazon has been on a URL shopping spree , splashing out on over 500 new domain names to add to its arsenal - including among them amazonsilkforandroid.com , amazonsilkformac.com and amazonsilkforpc.com . Catchy dot coms they may not be , but the new URLs certainly suggest that Amazon 's Kindle Fire browser , Silk , could be making its way on to other devices in the future . It 's no guarantee - Amazon may just be babysitting the domains so no one else can nab them , particularly given that the purchases were made through MarkMonitor , a brand protection agency - but it 's an interesting proposition , and one that makes a modicum of sense . Announced yesterday , Silk is currently only on the Kindle Fire tablet , and uses a nifty combo of caching and the cloud to make web browsing super speedy and less power intensive for the tablet itself . If these new URLs are to be believed , we could see this web capability come to other Android tablets and smartphones , as well as to the desktop PC and Mac computers . For the time being though , we 'd settle for Amazon to bring Silk to the UK on the Kindle Fire - a UK release date and pricing is nowhere to be seen . Via Fusible , SlashGear
Opera has responded to the arrival of the Amazon Silk browser – which has some remarkably similar technology to the Opera Turbo feature – by praising the internet giant for 'catching up ' . Norwegian company Opera has established a reputation of providing some of the greatest browser innovations , including tabs and the speed dial – familiar sights on the likes of Chrome . At the launch of the Kindle Fire , Amazon showed off its first foray into the browser world with Amazon Silk , which will use Amazon 's cloud computer system to make browsing faster and less needful of a powerful device . Although Silk takes the concept of a cloud browser much further than Turbo – the server taking some of the load is certainly an idea explored in the Opera feature – which compresses web pages to suit devices on more limited networks . `` You know , we 're a huge player in this field , '' Opera 's Phillip Grønvold told TechRadar . `` With more than 128 million users each month using Opera Mini it is clear the market for cloud based computing is in rapid growth . `` Each month we are adding millions of users who are participating in the Web and we feel good that other big time players like Amazon are catching on to the idea . '' It 's not exactly a stinging rebuke – although we 'd not expect such from the always-polite Opera . But it 's clear that Opera 's track record of influence in the browser sphere is continuing .

In times of great excitement , I like to paraphrase Noddy Holder - and today is one of those times . Ready ? So here it is , Merry Christmas Everybody 's Having Fun Apart from all the Android firms Who are probably chucking themselves off bridges right now The original was a bit catchier , but you get the gist : unless Amazon 's playing a great big joke and the Kindle Fire is as slow as a snail , then as far as the oh-so-lucrative Christmas shopping period in America is concerned Motorola , RIM , HP and the rest might as well pack up and go home . For Mr and Mrs Punter , choosing a tablet this Christmas means choosing between Apple 's one and Amazon 's one . The L word Jeff Bezos ' presentation was awfully reminiscent of an Apple keynote , from the montage of naysayers at the beginning to the `` these three pairs of socks wo n't cost you three pounds , or two pounds - no , these socks are just one pound ! Three pairs for a pound ! '' price announcement at the end . But the most important similarity was Bezos ' use of the L-word . He used it a few times , but the most important one was when Bezos said : `` We asked ourselves , is there some way we can bring all of these things together into a remarkable product customers will love ? '' I love my Kindle , and I love my iPad . I do n't love their processors , or their RAM , or their connectivity options , or any of the other guts . I love their simplicity , and that 's why I buy Kindles over other ebook readers and iPads over other tablets . Bezos - and by extension , Amazon - gets that , and the Kindle Fire clearly comes from that philosophy . This is n't something you 'd buy your mum and regret for the next three years as she calls every day with a new tech trouble ; this is something you can buy as a present and pretty much forget about it . Can you really say the same about an Asus Eee Pad Transformer ? It 's a lovely wee tablet for you , or for me - but is it really the right thing for anyone who is n't a geek ? The Kindle Fire does n't have to be a screamer , or particularly feature-packed : provided it does Facebook , films and Flash , that 's good enough for most - and of course , the Kindle Fire does Facebook , films and Flash . Provided Amazon has n't made a lemon here - and let 's face it , that 's pretty unlikely - then the Fire is something you can sell to a non-geek in a single sentence : it 's a Kindle that does music , movies , apps and web stuff too . It 's a PlayBook with email and better apps . It 's a half-price iPad . However you choose to describe it , I think you 're going to have a hard job getting hold of one . The Kindle Fire 's going to fly off the shelves in the same way BlackBerry PlayBooks do n't . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
Amazon announced this week the arrival of the Amazon Kindle Fire – its first ever assault on the burgeoning Android tablet market – and along with it a new mobile web browser called Silk . The Silk browser is , according to Amazon , a 'split browser ' which uses Amazon 's cloud service to speed up the web on a mobile device . The browser is both on the Kindle Fire and the Amazon EC2 ( elastic computing cloud ) , which should make for a faster web experience – as it takes into account things like network conditions , page complexity and the location of any cached content . Working with its cloud service the browser can , according to Amazon , request all website content simultaneously with EC2 , without overwhelming the mobile device processor or impacting battery life . Speaking about Amazon Silk , Jeff Bezos , CEO of Amazon , said : `` Kindle Fire introduces a revolutionary new web browser called Amazon Silk . `` We refactored and rebuilt the browser software stack and now push pieces of the computation into the AWS cloud . When you use Silk - without thinking about it or doing anything explicit - you 're calling on the raw computational horsepower of Amazon EC2 to accelerate your web browsing . '' For the moment the Silk browser is only available on the Amazon Kindle Fire , but there 's no doubt that we will see the service come to more devices soon . For more information on the new browser , go to www.amazon.com/silk - warning , the company goes into quite a lot of detail about latency within TCP connections , learning algorithms and multiplexing protocols . To help understand the tech behind Silk , Amazon has created a video which you can view below .
UPDATED : Amazon UK has issued a statement , which has been included Amazon has announced that the cheapest ever Kindle will be coming to the UK for the not insignificant price of £89 . Sounds like a good deal , until you register that the US 's cheapest Kindle is $ 79 – a straight conversion of which is approximately £50 . We 've asked Amazon to clarify why we have to pay so much more ; it looks as though the reason is that the $ 79 Kindle is an ad-supported ereader , so you save on the cover price but you have to put up with adverts . That 's not an option here in the UK . A spokesperson told TechRadar : `` Operating costs differ by country , but as with all products on Amazon , we work hard to offer customers the lowest possible prices . `` Regarding pricing , I would also like to clarify that the $ 79 Kindle includes special offers in the US ... Special offers are not currently available in the UK . '' So the more accurate equivalent Kindle in the US is the $ 109 basic model without ad support - that translates to £69 . Factor in 20 per cent VAT and you are getting much closer to parity . The new Kindle UK release date was also revealed – if you want to shell out that £89 , you can pre-order the ereader today , for delivery on 12 October . This nets you a QWERTY-less Kindle with Wi-Fi connectivity , which weighs in at a crazily light 170g . Amazon also announced a tablet , the Kindle Fire , and two Kindle Touch touchscreen e-readers , no word yet on a UK release date or pricing for these slates .
Amazon 's Kindle Fire tablet is taking all the headlines today and with it comes Whispersync for movies and TVs . It 's such a neat feature on the Kindle – the software syncs your progress as you read a book on the Kindle device so that when you access it from your computer , your iPhone , or whatever device you 're on next , you 're always in the right place . And now that functionality is coming to movies and television shows that you watch on your Kindle Fire , too . Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos explains , `` Customers love Whispersync -- so we thought you know what people would really like ? What if Whispersync also worked with movies and TV shows ? Well it does . `` When you get home , switch to your big screen TV . Your movie will be right where you left it . `` You wo n't have the frustration of needing to find your spot . ''
After months of speculation , the Amazon Kindle Fire has been officially announced at an event in New York , marking the first time the company has entered the tablet market proper . The successor to the Amazon Kindle is a 7-inch device that comes with Android , albeit a version that has been heavily altered by Amazon to make the best use of the company 's e-shopping spine . The screen is an IPS display that 's made from Gorilla Glass , it houses a dual-core processor , and weighs in at 14.6 ounces ( 413g ) . There is a tablet-optimised shopping app on board - this is said to comprise simplified and streamlined pages , so it is easier to buy stuff on than the actual Amazon website . There is a search bar at the top of the UI that allows you to search the Kindle Fire , the web or the Amazon store . You will be able to multi-task on the tablet too - so listening to music and reading at the same time is possible . You can switch between actions by bringing a screen down from the UI . When it comes to Amazon Kindle Fire specs , Amazon has decided that a number of things are not needed on the tablet which are found on other Android tablets . There is a lack of camera , a microphone or 3G , but there is Wi-Fi on board . Those who purchase the Amazon Kindle Fire will be given a 30-day trial with Amazon Prime . There will be a number of apps accessible on the device , including Pandora , Twitter , Facebook and Netflix . The biggest news is how much it will cost . The Amazon Kindle Fire price has been set at just $ 199 , way below the price of any of its rivals . Amazon has been laying the foundations for an Android tablet for some time now . Back in March it launched a rival to the Android Market . Called the Amazon Appstore , the site has managed to tempt people away from Google 's own web store by offering a number of exclusives . Couple this with the Kindle e-book store and the general Amazon e-shop and the tablet is a portable storefront for many a web purchase . Amazon has said the Kindle Fire will have access to 100,000 movies and TV shows , 17 million songs , access to the Amazon Appstore and Kindle books . You will also be able to peruse full colour magazines - and you do n't have to worry about space either , as you will be able to house all the content for free through Amazon cloud Storage . Amazon has also created a new browser for the Kindle Fire . Called the Silk browser , it harnesses Amazon 's cloud computing service to make browsing the web a speedier experience - offloading some of the harder CPU-heavy tasks to the cloud and giving the end user the best performance . Amazon is calling this a split browser , which offers up an uber-caching solution - so your favourite websites ( and sections of websites ) will load up much faster than newer content . This is something that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos believes is the key to the Amazon Kindle Fire , saying to Business Week about the tablet : `` We do n't think of the Kindle Fire as a tablet . We think of it as a service . '' At the event in New York , Bezos noted that the Kindle has succeeded when most people thought it would fail , with the sales of e-books rising exponentially but also the sales of real books rising as well . He called this the 're-inventing of the book ' . Amazon also announced the arrival of the Kindle Touch - a touchscreen version of the Amazon Kindle . It uses the same IR technology as the Sony Reader- and it 's the cheapest Kindle yet , which will retail at $ 79 . As of yet the Amazon Kindle Fire UK release date is still unknown - Amazon has told us this was a US launch - but we for one ca n't wait to play with ( the ) Fire .
Amazon has announced a brace of new Kindles this week , with the company revealing its cheapest Kindle yet . The new Kindle is coming to the US at the achingly low price of $ 79 . To put this into context it is the same price as a year 's subscription to Amazon Prime . In the UK , the price for the new Amazon Kindle has been pegged at £89 - still below the current price for the older Kindle 3 model but at first glance it does look like we have been stung a bit on the price . According to Amazon , though , this is because the $ 79 version of the Kindle will be ad-supported in the US and this version will not be coming to the UK . The non ad-supported version will retail in the US for £109 , which converts to around £70 . Add VAT to this and the figure looks more like what we will be paying in the UK . While the Amazon Kindle Fire tablet may have taken all the headlines from the e-tailer 's massive media event today , the new Kindles are not to be sniffed at , with the low price points signalling that e-reading is about to go mega mainstream . The new cheaper Kindle does n't have touchscreen connectivity like the original Kindle but it has done away with the keyboard and now just has buttons . Amazon has also improved on the page-turning capabilities - announcing that they are faster than ever . The cheaper Amazon Kindle joins a new line-up of Kindle devices , including the Amazon Kindle Touch , Touch 3G and the Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet . The Kindle Wi-Fi UK release date is 12 October . You can go to Amazon UK to pre-order the Wi-Fi Kindle now .

Amazon looks set to unveil its first foray into the tablet market this week , with a press conference pencilled in for Wednesday that 's likely to include an Amazon tablet announcement . There 's been much rumour and speculation that the e-shopping site is set to reveal a rival to the iPad , which will clock in at a much cheaper price and run Android . It is reported that the Amazon tablet is likely to have a 7-inch screen and link into Amazon 's many web properties , including its Kindle service and the Amazon App Store . Because of this , it is unlikely that an Amazon tablet UK release date will be announced . For a start , we still do n't have access to the App Store – although a loophole last week saw the store open up to non-US customers . There have been plenty of rivals to the Apple iPad , including the Samsung Galaxy Tab and more recently the Sony Tablet S , but if Amazon can deliver on the price point and monopolise on its already decent web store , then we could have a proper tablet fight on our hands come Christmas . There 's been too many rumours not to make an announcement this week a dead cert . Via Market Watch

The Amazon Android App Store could soon be officially available in the UK , with many British-based users already claiming they can download apps from the site . The alternative to the Android Market has been a US-only venture , since its launch in March this year . Now , for the first time , Amazon users with accounts based in the UK , as well as the Netherlands , India and Australia say they have obtained applications from the service . Amazon has yet to make an official announcement , there has been no update to the Amazon UK site and users who have been successful in downloading apps have been going through Amazon.com . The official status remains somewhat of a mystery . We tried logging into Amazon.com with our UK-based account , but geographical restrictions were still in place when we tried to download apps . It 's possible that Amazon is slowly making the service more widely available internationally , with more and more users being granted access as time goes on . The Amazon App Store has enjoyed a somewhat quiet first six months , despite offering free marquee apps on a daily basis . It also offers Android users the chance to test drive apps on their PC before deciding whether they 'd like to download them to their handset . A widespread international launch would certainly assist Amazon 's aim to gain traction and cut in on the Android Market 's dominance . We 've contacted Amazon for an official comment on this story , so stay tuned to TechRadar for the latest on the Amazon Android App Store 's UK launch . Link : Engadget

Compact system cameras are failing to make a dent in the purses of Amazon shoppers , as no mirrorless models can be found in the top 40 best selling cameras in the UK , US , Germany and France . Despite the huge increase in compact system cameras currently available on the market , and the frenzy surrounding rumoured Canon and Nikon releases , no existing compact system camera models are appearing in Amazon 's best seller lists . In Japan , official charts show the overall market placings of digital cameras , and these recently indicated that more than half of all cameras purchased were mirrorless models , with the new Olympus PEN E-PL3 appearing highest at no.6 . In other countries however , it 's harder to determine the best sellers as detailed reports are not so easily available . However , using sites such as Amazon is a good indicator of the overall market trend . It may seem surprising that the list does not include a CSC , but considering that the two major players , Canon and Nikon , are yet to enter the market , it could be that American and European consumers are waiting for these new releases . It could also be that the limited range of lenses available for compact system cameras is having an impact on shopping habits . When third party manufacturers such as Sigma , who announced it was working on some micro four thirds lenses earlier in the year , decide to make its products available , the concept of a mirrorless model may seem more attractive . On the Amazon UK site , the current best selling camera is the Panasonic Lumix FS35 , a three year old budget compact model , followed by the Fujifilm Finepix S2950 bridge camera . The first DSLR to appear in the list is Nikon 's entry level D3000 . With the majority of the cameras in Amazon UK 's top 20 falling into the `` budget '' end of the spectrum , this could perhaps suggest more about the buying habits of Amazon customers , with more `` serious '' photographers perhaps choosing to spend their cash in more established photographic outlets . A quick peek at dedicated photography stockist Warehouse Express however also shows that CSCs are not within its top 10 best sellers either , with the Nikon P300 compact topping the list followed by Nikon 's enthusiast DSLR , the D7000 . Interestingly , on the Amazon US site , Canon compacts dominate the top 3 , with the S100 which was only announced yesterday , storming into 3rd place . It 'll be interesting to see how any announcement from Nikon or Canon will impact the sales of compact system cameras , so keep following TechRadar for more details as they emerge .

The Amazon Kindle could be set to get an ebook subscription service , with a number of book publishers in talks with the etailer . This is according to the Wall Street Journal , which is quoting `` people familiar with the matter '' who have hinted that some sort of library system is in the offing . The idea of a rental system for an ereader is not new . Sony already has a library initiative in place . This is with libraries in the UK , where users of its Reader device can rent out titles , with a limited about of digital copies of each book available . Amazon 's version will be offered to Amazon Prime members in the US at first – who already pay out for a digital library – and will consist of a limited number of free ebook downloads per month . There 's no word on when the service will be available but it is raising concerns within the publishing industry , with one unnamed exec saying about the potential service : `` what it would do is downgrade the value of the book business . '' If Amazon was to release ebook rentals , it would add to an eco-system that 's primed for the eventual launch of the Amazon Kindle tablet . It 's very probable that Amazon is looking into creating a rentable library of content , so we are marking this rumour as Quite Likely . Via WSJ

Amazon.co.uk has opened pre-order for the PS Vita , with both the Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi + 3G models available to stake your claim on . Although the UK site does n't give anything away on the delivery date front , the US site Amazon.com reckons pre-orderers will get your new console on New Year 's Eve . It 'll set you back £279.99 to pre-order the Wi-Fi and 3G version , while the Wi-Fi only model saves you fifty quid , coming in at £229.99 . The 3G-toting PS Vita does n't list a network partner for the provision of the data in the UK , but we expect you 'll need to pay a little bit extra for your non-Wi-Fi internet connectivity no matter who it 's with . And what do you get for your money ? The complete spec has n't been made public yet , but we do know it 'll bring you a 5-inch OLED touchscreen , twin cameras , twin speakers , twin analogue sticks and a quad-core ARM Cortex A9 processor . PS Vita games look set to include Assassin 's Creed , Michael Jackson : the Experience , Street Fighter X Tekken and Super Stardust Delta . If that 's not enough Vita-love for you , we 've rounded everything you need to know up into one handy video : From OLED-info.com via SlashGear

The Amazon Kindle tablet will boast a 7-inch form-factor , a multi-touch screen , run on Android and cost about half the price of the Apple iPad , according to a writer who claims to have seen the device . MG Siegler of the influential TechCrunch blog says he has seen and played with a Design Verification Testing unit of the heavily-rumoured device , which is expected to arrive during the autumn . Siegler , who claims he could not post any pictures as part of a seemingly covert hands-on , says the device can be likened to that of the BlackBerry Playbook in terms of form-factor . Amazon has yet to officially confirm it will launch a tablet , although there is an Amazon press conference slated for tomorrow . In the meantime , check out our Amazon Kindle tablet rumour video . A colour , touchscreen Kindle with Android His report claims says the Amazon tablet will still be called a Kindle and will be the first device under that banner to boast a full-colour touchscreen . `` The device is a 7-inch tablet with a capacitive touch screen . It is multi-touch , but from what I saw , I believe the reports that it relies on a two-finger multi-touch ( instead of 10-finger , like the iPad uses ) are accurate . `` This will be the first Kindle with a full-color screen . And yes , it is back-lit . There is no e-ink to be found anywhere on this device . '' Siegler also confirms that the device will be running Android , although the experience is likely to be hugely different from other Android tablets like the Motorola Xoom . He adds : `` As anticipated , Amazon has forked Android to build their own version for the Kindle . Simply put : it looks nothing like the Android you 're used to seeing . `` The interface is all Amazon and Kindle . It 's black , dark blue , and a bunch of orange . The main screen is a carousel that looks like Cover Flow in iTunes which displays all the content you have on the device . '' Perhaps most tellingly , TechCrunch says that the device will ship for around $ 250 ( £170 as a direct conversion ) , which is half the price of the cheapest Apple iPad model in the US . The recent HP TouchPad fire sale has shown that there is massive mainstream interest in competitively priced tablets . Siegler also adds that a 10-inch version of the device is also on the way , but those plans have been delayed until early 2012 . Via TechCrunch

The Kindle Fire has n't started shipping yet , but it 's already embroiled in a controversy : its web browser , Amazon Silk , effectively gives Amazon access to its users ' browsing history . It 's almost certainly less sinister than it appears , but it raises some interesting questions : how much privacy are you willing to give up for a slightly better online experience ? On the face of it , Amazon 's Silk does n't do anything that Opera Mini does n't already do , or that Google 's short-lived Web Accelerator did n't do six years ago . Is there a substantive difference ? Chester Wisniewski , senior security adviser with Sophos , thinks there is . `` Opera promises not to log or use the information they get from operating the proxy servers used by Opera Mini , whereas Amazon specifically states they will log this information , '' he says , pointing out that Amazon 's T & Cs say that `` We generally do not keep this information for longer than 30 days '' - which is rather vague . `` Is it 30 , or is n't it ? '' he asks . Matthew Prince is CEO of content delivery network Cloudflare . `` A lot of it has to do with timing , '' he told TechRadar . `` When Opera Mini and Google 's Web Accelerator were introduced years ago , they had the benefit of being seemingly small and innocent , not large and strategic like the way Amazon is perceived now . `` We live in a new era where we have seen the consequences of giving up privacy via meeting friends on Facebook or searching on Google , and now people are questioning what they have to give up in order to have the web browsing experience they want . '' BETTER SERVICE ? : By monitoring users ' browsing , Amazon could improve its recommendations for media and apps Amazon is n't alone here : for example , Google 's Google+ hopes to harness our social connections to improve the search engine 's accuracy and the usefulness of its advertising , while Facebook is doing its very best to be the 21st century AOL , a walled garden nobody ever leaves . `` Our browsing data appears to be extremely valuable considering the effort that Facebook , Google , Microsoft and others put into tracking our every nuance online , '' Wisniewski says . Prince agrees . `` Imagine that a marketer could look over your shoulder 24/7 while you surfed the internet , '' he says . `` They 'll be able to see where you shopped , how much you paid for it , how long you were on the site , what other products you looked at - the entire web experience will be available to Amazon ... as a retailer , Amazon is in a unique position to turn that data into valuable insights . '' Amazon 's lack of clarity worries people like congressman Edward Markey , who wrote ( PDF link ) to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about the browser technology . The congressman 's questions seem fair enough to us : `` What information does Amazon plan to collect about users of the Kindle Fire ? How does Amazon intend to use this information ? Does Amazon plan to sell , rent or otherwise make available this information to outside companies ? '' SWITCHING OFF : On the Kindle Fire the Silk browser 's acceleration will be enabled by default , but you 'll be able to switch it off Dan Auerbach of the Electronic Frontier Foundation was worried too , and the EFF took its concerns to Amazon . Encrypted traffic is n't intercepted at all , Auerbach reports , and `` for the persistent SPDY connection between the device and Amazon 's servers , Amazon assures us that the only pieces of information from the device that are regularly logged are [ the ] URL of the resource being requested , timestamp [ and ] token identifying a session . '' That 's the good news . The bad ? `` Amazon stores URLs you visit , and these sometimes contain identifying information . '' That means `` Amazon will effectively have a database of user search histories across many different databases ... moreover , the data collected by Amazon provides a ripe source of users ' collective browsing habits . '' The EFF 's advice is that Kindle Fire users who worry about privacy should turn the cloud-based browsing system off . The problem with privacy is that it 's a balancing act : without sufficient information , some services are useless . Take Apple 's iPhone , for example : if it is n't broadcasting its - and your - location then Find My Phone and Find My Friends are utterly useless . The best example of the trade-off , though , is Siri . The iPhone 4S 's virtual personal assistant needs to know lots about you in order to do its job . As Ed Wrenbeck , former lead developer from Siri , explains : `` For Siri to be really effective , it has to learn a great deal about the user . If it knows where you work , where you live and what kind of places you like to go , it can really start to tailor itself as it becomes an expert on you individually . This requires a great deal of trust in the institution collecting this data . Siri did n't have this , but Apple has earned their street cred . '' `` It could well be that amazon built the technology solely for the engineering reasons - faster and improved performance , better battery life , etc - not the marketing reasons , '' Prince says . `` If that 's the case , then [ privacy ] concerns may have in fact been a surprise to them . To that end , the privacy concerns will be resolved if consumers think the technology is worth it . They may be willing to give Amazon Silk a try if the web experience is that much better ... it will be interesting to see how this pans out . '' The EFF thinks we need to pay close attention to what firms are doing with our data . `` As companies continue to innovate in ways that make novel uses of -- and expose much more personal data to -- the internet cloud , it 's critical that the legal protections for that data keep up with changes [ in ] technology , '' Auerbach writes . `` These things tend to be fine until they are not fine , '' Prince says . `` People may be okay with Amazon looking over their shoulder , making recommendations and so on , but there may come a time when Amazon will cross the line and it becomes creepy . We 've seen that happen before with other companies . '' Are we walking into a world where your choice of smartphone , tablet , browser or social network locks you into a single shop and hands over your entire life for data mining and ad targeting ? Wisniewski hopes not . `` These private areas - think AOL - never survive in the long term , '' he says . `` People inherently want simplicity and freedom of choice , [ and ] while the simplicity of using one store for music , books or movies is appealing , people also want the ability to choose who they do business with . `` Once these systems become too restrictive people will either demand openness , or switch to the next shiny object that will provide it . There is a risk we are heading in [ the wrong ] direction , but I am optimistic that people are becoming more aware of the importance and value their privacy has .

Amazon has revealed that it is stepping up production of its Kindle Fire tablet after pre-orders exceeded its expectations . Speaking at the company 's hugely profitable and yet disappointing financial results for the last quarter , Amazon chief Jeff Bezos spilled the beans on the early interest in the Android Kindle Fire tab and the more traditional Kindle products . `` In the three weeks since launch , orders for electronic ink Kindles are double the previous launch , '' Bezos said . `` And based on what we 're seeing with Kindle Fire preorders , we 're increasing capacity and building millions more than we 'd already planned . '' This is big news for Amazon – who will look to make back any losses it makes on each unit by sales of media such as television , film , music , apps and old friend ebooks . The Kindle Fire could well prove to be a genuine competitor for the leviathan that is Apple 's iPad , with the online shopping giant in the position to launch the tab at a loss-making and therefore hugely competitive price point of $ 199 . The debacle around the HP TouchPad has shown the consumer interest in a low cost tablet – and a sub $ 200 price , which would hint at a £199 Kindle Fire UK price – makes it less of a luxury purchase . We 're still waiting for news on a Kindle Fire UK release date , but we 're hoping to see it in early 2012 , unless Amazon is holding fire ( sorry ) for the next generation of devices before looking to non-US markets . In other Amazon news , the company 's quarterly results showed net income for the period of $ 63 million , compared to $ 231 million in the same period last year . Revenue was up to $ 10.88 billion - a 44 per cent increase - but not enough to meet analysts estimates who had expected earnings of 24 cent a share rather than the 14 cents they actually got .

More attractive ebooks could be on their way to a Kindle near you , as Amazon Kindle Format 8 ( KF8 ) will come with HTML5 support . The big news here is that publishers will be able to make ebooks a lot more exciting , using interactive elements and snazzier layouts . Ebook designers will be able to make use of CSS3 support and fixed layouts , as well as embedded fonts for a wider variety of typefaces . Books will also be able to have drop caps ( which is when the first letter of a paragraph is enlarged to add a bit of variety ) . There 's also the option to include floating elements and bullet-point lists as part of the 150 new formatting options , which will all add a bit more interest to the whole Kindle experience . Unfortunately for us UK dwellers , the Kindle Fire will be the first Kindle product to support KF8 , which means no flashily designed ebooks for us just yet . It makes sense , though – the Kindle Fire is the first of the line up to offer an all-singing , all-dancing colour touchscreen , so expect gorgeous looking art books , picture books and comic boo… er , we mean graphic novels . However , support for the new format is set to roll out over the next few months , taking in existing software and hardware as it goes . Via SlashGear and WebMonkey
Innovation is often a slow process . Companies take a few fumbling steps , invent minor new technologies , and sometimes put them together into a new product . With Amazon Silk , the new browser that will debut on the Amazon Kindle Fire tablet , the innovation is that part of the processing occurs on the handheld device but most of the heavy-lifting is done on a massive cluster of computers , an existing platform called Amazon EC2 ( Elastic Compute Cloud ) . So how does it work ? Jon Jenkins , the director of Amazon Silk , told TechRadar that every page request is analysed in a split second to `` dynamically determine a division of labour '' . That means analysing every web component : the HTML files , the CSS , the JavaScript , and even the layout and design of the page . Silk splits these chores , sometimes by percentages ( 40 % handled by the phone , 60 % handled by the cloud ) , and also looks at network speed , the page complexity , and cached content . Few companies could pull this off - Amazon currently has 450 billion stored objects in its cloud database . But the real innovation is how the device is intelligently connected to this cloud - it 's not just a split of content between local storage and the cloud , says Jenkins , but an intelligent management of all the web components , in split seconds , to speed up browsing . Amazon has not released any data about how much faster the Kindle Fire will run for web browsing . And , there are some questions about privacy ( since the sites you visit will be analysed routinely and some data will be processed on Amazon servers ) as well as how Silk will handle complex pages . We asked Jenkins specifically about a complex page at our colleagues ' site GamesRadar.com , which is good example because of its rich Adobe Flash content , advertising , and scripts . For a typical page , there are 58 files to download from about 13 domains for a total of about 450K per page . ( That figure does not include the streaming files such as audio clips or videos that do not download automatically . ) Silk handles this complex page in a unique way . Most browsers , including the one you are using to read this , will handle a block of browser requests at the same time , but will wait to handle any additional processing until the first request is complete , says Jenkins . That 's why a page might load slowly , especially if some of the information has to be processed from another site . Silk 's innovation is that all of the page requests are handled at the same time and parsed out to the cloud . Another interesting trick : Silk keeps track of this parsing . Jenkins says Silk can keep track of how the processing worked for , say , the last 100,000 users - that in all cases , the same logo header was downloaded and that the page did not change this routine . When you visit using the browser , Silk might decide to use a `` smart push '' and send you that logo header to speed up browsing even further . Even with Flash files , Jenkins says Silk intelligently analyses the content and can decide if it would be faster to run a Flash file locally or in the cloud , depending on the content . So what happens if you connect in a low bandwidth area ? Jenkins says Silk will respond in kind , pushing most content processing out to the cloud and relying even more on smart push . Some people might wonder about whether Silk compromises on privacy . After all , if you visit a hacker site or a BitTorrent repository using the Silk browser , Amazon is splitting out these files . Some of them will be processed and tracked by the browser . Jenkins says all of the data processing occurs in aggregate - Amazon does not keep a record of your identity and which pages you visit . Of course , that does n't mean Silk wo n't track your IP address . The browser obviously knows which IP you are using to request the page load , and must keep track of this data in order to understand how many people are accessing a page and whether to push some content . As for the actual speed increases , we wo n't know that until we write our Kindle Fire review on 15 November .

Amazon has detailed a new e-book format for use on the Kindle Fire , which is set to offer up a more interactive experience for things like comic books , children 's novels and cookbooks . New enhancements that make up the format include HTML5 support , fixed layouts , nested tables , callouts , sidebars and Scalable Vector Graphics . In short , Amazon is hoping that its new e-book format will show off the potential of the Kindle Fire , and hide the fact the tablet 's screen is not made from e-ink so is not as easy on the eye for reading like the Kindle e-book reader . Amazon is calling the file format KF8 ( Kindle Format 8 ) and has revealed that it will be replacing Mobi 7 . In all there are over 150 new formatting capabilities and the good news is that a new version of Kindle Publisher Tools is just around the corner , so devs can start utilising the new format shortle . Amazon is keen to point out that all versions of Kindle books will be available on the Kindle Fire , but using KF8 will add a little je ne sais quoi to books . There is still no Kindle Fire UK release date – but we are hoping the device ( or an iteration of it ) will be released sometime in 2012 . Via Electronista

Some things are universal : go to any playground anywhere in the world , and sooner or later some huffy kid will announce that it 's their ball and they 're taking it home . Replace `` playground '' with `` internet '' and `` huffy kid '' with Google and what do you get ? That 's right : encrypted search queries ! Here 's what Google says : `` As search becomes an increasingly customised experience , we recognise the growing importance of protecting the personalised search results we deliver . As a result , we 're enhancing our default search experience for signed-in users . '' Here 's what Google means : `` Up yours , Amazon ! '' Google adds : `` We hope that today 's move to increase the privacy and security of your web searches is only the next step in a broader industry effort to employ SSL encryption more widely and effectively . '' Or as pop moppets Daphne and Celeste once put it : `` Up your butt with a coconut ! `` . Maybe I 'm reading too much into it , but the timing looks awfully suspicious : less than two weeks ago , Amazon unveiled its Silk browser , which just happens to see everything Kindle Fire users do . A domain name buying spree strongly hints that Silk is coming to other devices too : `` We could see this web capability come to other Android tablets and smartphones , as well as to the desktop PC and Mac computers , '' TechRadar 's Kate Solomon writes . If you 're wondering where Google comes into it , the Electronic Frontier Foundation provides the answer : while privacy concerns over Silk are probably exaggerated , `` given the common practice employed by search engines of putting query terms in the URL as parameters , Amazon will effectively have a database of user search histories across many different search engines . '' There 's one kind of traffic Silk does n't intercept : secure HTTP . SSL page requests bypass Amazon 's servers altogether . Guess what kind of traffic Google 's now suggesting you use ? Viewed in that light , the language used in Google 's blog post is illuminating : it 's using SSL to protect `` the personalised search results we deliver '' - your privacy does n't get mentioned until later on . SSL does , of course , help protect privacy , but that does n't seem to be the main motivator here . What we 're seeing here is simple . It 's Google 's ball , and it 's taking it home . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

Amazon 's latest statistics show a marked increase in the use of its cloud storage , as the concept of keeping your data online begins to go mainstream . Amazon 's S3 service ( simple storage service ) has apparently doubled the amount of objects in its servers since the turn of the year . That has seen 2010 's final total of 262 billion objects to the current level at more than 566 billion . That 's a lot of objects . The internet giant has been a major player in cloud storage – spotting the potential of the market early and making a name for itself with the likes of S3 and EC2 . With a burgeoning hardware business generated by the Kindle , the cloud storage capacity means that the company can do some very cool things with its devices . That includes the Silk browser on the forthcoming Amazon Kindle Fire tablet , which taps into the cloud to ease the burden on the device itself . Via The Next Web

Amazon is taking around 50,000 pre-orders a day for the Kindle Fire Android tablet , according to leaked internal documents . The Cult of Android website says it has obtained screenshots of internal inventory management system , which display the impressive demand for the sub- $ 200 tablet . The figures suggest that Amazon has already racked-up 250,000 sales just five days after the announcement and is currently processing around 2,000 new orders every hour . The site points out that if the current level of demand continues at the same level until the November 15th launch , the company will have to stuff 2.5m envelopes . Apple shifted 2.5m iPad 2 tablets in its first month on sale this spring so it seems possible that the Kindle Fire will reach that make before the device even hits the virtual shelves . Although Apple did n't allow iPad-fanciers to pre-order their device almost six weeks in advance , but there 's a good chance Amazon will have the biggest tablet launch ever on its hands . Cult of Android 's `` inside source '' claims Amazon is `` ecstatic '' with the public reaction to the cheap-as-chips Android tablet so far . Via : CultofAndroid

Amazon looks like it 's not content with just having a shot at the e-reader and tablet market , with reports emanating from Asia that it wants a smartphone too . According to CitiGroup , Amazon is looking to launch a smartphone in Q4 2012 in association with Foxconn International Holdings , and will aim it at the cheaper end of the market . The research note states that the phone will cost Amazon $ 170 ( £107 ) and that the company may actually sell it for close to that amount , losing money but increasing the impact in the market . `` For a normal brand like HTC , they need to price the product at US $ 243 to make 30 % gross margin . If Amazon is actually willing to lose some money on the device , the price gap could be even bigger , '' notes Kevin Chang of CitiGroup in Taipei . It looks likely the phone will be running Android , just like the Kindle Fire , as despite not explicitly mentioning Google 's OS , stipulations of a payment to Microsoft being necessary hint strongly this will be the case . The only question remains over why Amazon would actually want to release a smartphone ; an e-reader and tablet make perfect sense , given the firm wants to use the devices as a platform to farm out its content . But a smartphone would only really be useful for music and some tolerant movie fans - and it will need to be pretty special to be a hit at the end of next year . We 'll rate this rumour right down the middle - after Amazon 's recent exploits , we would n't put it past the online giant to meddle in another market . Via AllThingsD
The Amazon Kindle Fire costs just over its $ 199 in components according to teardown specialists IHS iSuppli . TechRadar has previously speculated ( along with everyone else ) that the Kindle Fire was being sold at a loss by Amazon as it looks to make its money back on media sales . And , iSuppli 's figure of $ 201.70 means that this is indeed the case , with all the not inconsiderable marketing and research costs to add to this . The Amazon Kindle Fire appears to be a massive hit for Amazon based on early sales , with the company already extending its manufacturing order following good pre-sales . Now the modified Android tablet has arrive in the US , the subsidised price point has not only given it a massive burst of publicity , but also left it pouring from both Amazon 's virtual shelves and third-party retailers ' actual ones . iSuppli 's figure shows that Amazon has done everything it can to keep its costs down and losses small – with hardware not even trying to stack up against premium tablets like Apple 's iPad . `` All the choices have been made here to minimize the hardware cost , '' said iSuppli analyst Andrew Rassweiler . `` We expected to see a certain wireless module that 's commonly been seen in other tablets , and we were surprised that it was n't there . `` There was a cheaper one with fewer features that saved them a few bucks . '' Of course , with the components world constantly moving on , the costs will inevitably drop quickly for Amazon to produce the Kindle Fire , which means that it could well start actually making a small gain on the tablets themselves , and continue to rake in money from the media sold on the device .

The Amazon Kindle Fire 2 is set for a spring 2012 launch and is poised to be another 7-inch tablet . This is according to DigiTimes , which is reporting that Quanta Computer has already been given the order to start producing the new device . Numbers for the Amazon Kindle Fire have been increasing and it is thought Amazon has added another chassis supplier to its belt – which means three production outlets are now poised to produce components for the Kindle Fire , the latest being Nishoku . Nishoku is set to start producing chassis for Amazon at the end of 2012 , which ties in with the information DigiTimes has dug up about Quanta Computer . The Amazon Kindle Fire has only just been released in the US – to mixed reviews – but straight from its launch , there have been rumours that a Kindle 2 is just around the corner . The Kindle 2 is set to be quite a bit different from its predecessor . It is thought that Amazon will redesign the device so it does n't have the same look and feel of the PlayBook – something many of the reviews refer to . Considering the original Kindle Fire UK release date is still unknown it will be interesting to see if we actually get the first Fire at all or if Amazon will hold off launching in the UK until its successor is out . Given DigiTime 's so-so relationship with rumours , we are filing this one under : It 's Possible . From DigiTimes
Amazon 's Jeff Bezos has insisted that Microsoft should be included in any list of the current great tech innovators . Bezos , referring to a statement by Google 's Eric Schmidt that names Google , Apple , Facebook and Amazon as the 'four horsemen ' of tech , told Wired that Microsoft could not be excluded . `` Lists like that are fine and interesting , but if I were making that list I would have a hard time not having Microsoft on it , '' said Bezos . `` They 've done a lot of innovative things , some of which get overshadowed by their big existing businesses . `` You look at something like Kinect , it 's pretty cool . '' Bezos ' profile has never been higher , with the Amazon Kindle Fire US release this week representing a key moment for Amazon . The low-cost tablet may well prove to be a major player in that part of the market , backed by Amazon 's well established market of media . Bezos points out that it 's important to see how quickly technology moves on , pointing to the big guns of a decade ago . `` But one question to ask when you see a list like that is , who would have been on it 10 years ago ? '' added Bezos . `` That will keep you humble . Go back to 1980. Who would you have predicted to be among the four horsemen of the personal computer era ? `` There are always shiny things . A company should n't get addicted to being shiny , because shiny does n't last . You really want something that 's much deeper-keeled . `` You want your customers to value your service . And there are companies that have n't gone through tough times , so they 're not really tested . '' Via Wired
Amazon has announced that its Kindle Daily Deal promotional campaign has reached the UK , with a new book offered up at a cheap price every day . The 'daily deal ' initiative has been around in the US for a while and while the US Amazon site supports any Amazon Kindle from outside of the US it is great to see the UK get some bargain love as well . On a blog , Amazon said about the new deal promotion : `` Today we 're launching the Kindle Daily Deal where we unveil a Kindle book at a specially discounted price each day – for that day only . `` You 'll save big from the previous day 's price so to ensure you do n't miss a deal , check back daily or follow us on Twitter or Facebook . The first Kindle Daily Deal is Where the Shadows Lie by Michael Ridpath . Get it today for £0.99 – a savings of 75 per cent from yesterday 's price . '' The launch of Kindle Daily Deal is great but does little to get the sour taste out of our mouths that we are not going to get the Amazon Kindle Fire for some time yet .

The Amazon App Store for Android version 2.0 has rolled out in preparation for the US launch of the Kindle Fire . With the Amazon Kindle Fire rolling out for the US market on 15 November , Amazon knows that its app strategy is a central pillar to supporting its new venture . Version 2.0 of the Amazon App Store brings in a subscriptions item in the main app menu , and overhauls the look and feel to make it more similar to the Kindle Fire 's interface . Obviously it will be a few days before the true impact of the changes is made clear , with the launch date likely to bring a wealth of new content for the store . The Kindle Fire has already attracted huge interest and , positively for Amazon , enough pre-orders to prompt the internet giant to increase its production demands . Although we are yet to hear of any Amazon Kindle Fire UK release date , there is plenty of desire for a low cost tablet , which will be thrust into a market dominated by Apple 's iPad . The low price means that Amazon will be desperate to push content from its own virtual shelves in order to make its Kindle Fire project a commercial hit . But with early signs positive , the company must be growing in confidence that it can replicate the success that it had with its Kindle ebook reader . Via The Verge

Amazon has reportedly upped its order for Kindle Fire tablets from its manufacturers following better than expected pre-orders . The Amazon Kindle Fire is one of the most eagerly anticipated tablets , with a low price point that could see it become an instant competitor to the market-leading Apple iPad . The early signs have been very positive for Amazon , with interest turning into pre-orders for the US launch . We are still waiting on an Amazon Kindle Fire UK release date , but good sales in the US would bode well for a move across the Atlantic . The suggestions are that Amazon projected 4 million sales , but the manufacturers have apparently now been tasked with assembling 5 million units . Of course , the business plan for Amazon revolves around people buying content for the Kindle Fire - which is heavily subsidised by the company in the same way as the likes of Sony and Microsoft 's games consoles . The Kindle has shown a desire for ebooks , and Amazon will be hoping that this will continue alongside boosted sales for digital copies of TV shows , films and of course Apps from its store .

Amazon may be planning to integrate its own version of the Siri personal assistant into Kindle gadgets , after purchasing a speech recognition company . Reports suggest Amazon has picked-up the Charlotte-based Yap voice-to-text start-up , after a local newspaper picked-up on a filing to the SEC ( U.S. Securities and Exchange commission ) . Yap , which remains in private Beta will transcribe voicemails among other things , but shut-down it 's public transcription service late last month , perhaps with the Amazon purchase in mind . Amazon has not commented on the reported purchase , in fact the transaction officially went through under the name of a company registered to an Amazon.com building . Amazon 's presumed plans to integrate Yap into its own services comes after Apple launched the iPhone 4S last month with the impressive Siri personal assistant . Google has also invested heavily in voice-recognition in recent times with speech-to-text an important part of its ecosystem and the Google Translate app earning great reviews .

An Amazon executive has given a rather rare insight into just how many Kindle devices are being sold by the online retailer . In a statement the company revealed that more than one million Kindle devices a week have been bought by consumers and that despite some lukewarm reviews , the Kindle Fire is the most popular thing ever to be sold on Amazon . `` Kindle Fire is the most successful product we 've ever launched - it 's the bestselling product across all of Amazon for 11 straight weeks , we 've already sold millions of units , and we 're building millions more to meet the high demand , '' explained Dave Limp , vice president of Amazon Kindle . `` In fact , demand is accelerating - Kindle Fire sales increased week over week for each of the past three weeks . People are buying Kindle Fire because it 's a simple , fully-integrated service that makes it easy to do the things they love - watch movies , read books and magazines , listen to music , download apps , play games , and surf the web . '' Before this admission , Amazon had been tight-lipped about sales figures . We 're not quite sure for what reason , considering its products are proving to be immensely popular . The Kindle Fire has yet to land in the UK , but it is hoped it will come some time in early 2012 . When it does arrive , it may well have some competition in the guise of an iPad mini .

Amazon has revealed that the Kindle family of devices are selling at over one million each week in the run up to Christmas . The sales figures include the new Kindle Fire tablet which the company says has been the best-selling item across the entire site since it became available for pre-order 11 weeks ago . `` Kindle Fire is the most successful product we 've ever launched , '' said Kindle VP Dave Limp . `` it 's the bestselling product across all of Amazon for 11 straight weeks , we 've already sold millions of units , and we 're building millions more to meet the high demand . '' The $ 199 tablet , only available in the US , may have been selling the lion 's share , but the $ 79 Kindle reader , $ 99 Kindle Touch and $ 149 Kindle 3G have also been selling well ahead of Christmas . The online retailer is usually coy about revealing sales figures , but it seems this was just too good of an opportunity to boast about its own-branded range of readers and tablets . Despite the sales surge , the last couple of weeks have n't been too kind on the Kindle Fire , with a number of complaints about Wi-Fi reliability , sluggish navigation and the lack of privacy the device offers . A software update to clear-up these perceived ills is set to launch within the next two weeks . Via : Engadget

Amazon has promised a software update for its Kindle Fire tablet , which will attempt to fix a number of nagging complaints from users . The $ 200 Amazon Kindle Fire , which has been on sale for less than a month , has been suffering from Wi-Fi reliability issues , navigational sluggishness as well as problems with some of the platform 's apps . An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to the New York Times : `` In less than two weeks , we 're rolling out an over-the-air update to Kindle Fire . '' The update , according to the NYT , will also address privacy issues , including the ability to edit and delete items from the list of things you 've recently been doing . That particular piece of functionality , which shows recently browsed apps and documents within the homescreen carousel , has the potential to catch-out many users . The NYT also reaffirmed popular opinion that the first Kindle Fire will `` soon '' be superseded by a brand new version . The newer iteration will probably include functionality left out of the original device in order to get it on sale for Christmas . Via : New York Times
The new £89 Amazon Kindle topped the sales list on its busiest ever day , with the ebook reader racking up its highest one day sales on Cyber Monday last week . According to figures published by Amazon , the UK webstore saw phenomenal sales for the Kindle – with the new keyboard-less offering clearly hitting the present-worthy price window . `` History tells us that the busiest online shopping day is the first Monday in December and this year has followed that trend , '' said Amazon UK 's MC Christopher North . `` This year , Cyber Monday saw the most items ever ordered in a single day with Kindle being the stand-out product that looks set to appear under the most Christmas trees this festive season . '' Of course , one of Amazon 's most high-profile offerings is not available in the UK , with the Amazon Kindle Fire tablet UK release date still a mystery . When and if it does arrive , the level of interest in the Kindle Fire is clearly mounting . With the Kindle selling well in the UK , and the hoo-ha around the HP TouchPad firesale there is clearly an appetite for low-cost devices in Britain , and that is likely to be , ahem , tapped into .

In the run up to Christmas , Amazon 's top 20 best-selling digital cameras includes only compacts , with a good majority costing less than £100 . Sitting at the top of the tree is the Panasonic TZ20 , a mid-range compact camera that has received many favourable reviews . Second is the Fujifilm S4000 bridge camera , while coming in third is the Canon IXUS 115 HS . The entire top 20 is filled with compact cameras , with it reaching number 23 before a DSLR , the Canon EOS 550D , appears , and again at number 28 with the Canon EOS 1100D . Those two DSLRs represent the only two cameras of its type within the entire top 40 , with a further two appearing at number 65 and 68 , bringing the grand total up to four . Looking at stats like this would seem to suggest that shoppers are looking for stocking fillers for other people , rather than splashing out on serious equipment . Furthermore , over half of the top 20 were under £100 . One of the newest cameras to appear on the top 20 list is the Samsung MV800 , which has invested heavily in television advertising over the recent weeks , and it seems to be paying off . Another notable absence from both the top 20 and the top 40 are compact system cameras . Despite considerable advertising spend for the Sony NEX-5N , it is only the Panasonic Lumix G3 which appears in the top 100 . It will be interesting to see how the table changes in the post-Christmas spending period , which may see differing results , depending on January offers .

The Amazon Kindle Fire racked up an impressive six million sales over the festive season , according to one industry analyst . The budget Android tablet only went on sale on November 15th , but managed to hit the six million mark by the end of 2011 , says Jordan Rohan of investment bank Stifel Niclaus . Rohan 's estimate has been upgraded from his previous guess of five million and if true would almost double the iPad 's first quarter sales of 3.2m in just six weeks . The unofficial figures wo n't worry Apple too much as it just announced record iPad sales of 15.4 million for the last quarter . The comparison suggests two things : Firstly , that Kindle Fire sales are not cutting in on iPad sales , but bringing new people into the tablet arena at a lower price point . Secondly , that the public is infinitely more engaged with the need to own a tablet compared with two years ago when the first iPad launched . Six million sales would put the Amazon Kindle Fire way out in front of the chasing pack of Android tablets , largely thanks to it 's friendly price-point which comes it at almost half of the price of the leading contenders .

Amazon continues to add improvements to its blockbusting Kindle Fire tablet with a new firmware update that allows full-screen web-browsing . The custom-built Silk browser can now be optimised to make full use of the budget tablet 's 7-inch screen . Firmware update 6.2.2 also brings a few minor performance tweaks and bug fixes to the best-selling Android slate . The over-the-air update , which is available now , is the second upgrade to the Kindle Fire 's wares since its release in November . The first 6.2.1 release brought improvements to the user interface following complaints from users about sluggish performance . It also addressed privacy concerns by adding a lock screen passcode and allowing users to remove recently-accessed items from the homepage carousel . Via : Engadget
Amazon UK is reporting a 491 per cent rise in sales of telescopes as the British turn their eyes skyward after watching Stargazing Live with Professor Brian Cox . So much did the viewing public enjoy Stargazing Live that telescope sales went up six-fold in the three hours after it aired after 3.8m people tuned in earlier this week . Neil Campbell , camera and photo store manager at Amazon.co.uk , explained : `` Each time the popular physicist appears on TV we see a jump in telescope sales and that would appear to point to a significant 'Brian Cox effect ' encouraging a renewed interest in stargazing . '' Professor Brian Cox , whose glory days as the keyboard player in D : Ream are too often overlooked , has been responsible for the astronomy renaissance as impressionable young geeks and women of a certain age fall under the spell of his enthusiastic grin and incredibly large brain . Astronomy hipsters who have been tracking the heavens since before Cox even picked up his first telescope , yeah , are no doubt outraged at the mainstreamification of their niche pastime . But it 's happy days for Amazon whose virtual tills are ringing as its telescopic goods , priced from £18 , sell like hot cakes - and yet more proof that tools like Zeebox , which allow you to purchase goods seen on TV as you watch , are going to get more and more useful in the coming years . Those who ca n't be bothered faffing around with telescopes and that , why not take a trip into the stratosphere from your desktop ? Here 's how .

Amazon has released its video games sales chart for 2011 , and there are a few unexpected results inside . Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 3 was expected to top the charts , and it did so in the physical media chart , but only came in at number eight in digital downloads . The big successes of Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim and Battlefield 3 were outshone by Ubisoft 's casual shape-throw-'em-up Just Dance 3 , presumably helped out by the popularity of Microsoft Xbox Kinect , and y'know , dancing . In the digital chart , Deus Ex : Human Revolution sneaked in at the top spot , closely followed by Battlefield 3 and The Sims 3 . Check out the full chart below : Via Joystiq

Amazon has released an application that allows users to send documents directly from a PC to their Kindle . This will come as a relief to many Kindle users who have been using the less convenient method of emailing documents to a Send to Kindle email address . The new software means that PC users must simply right click on Word documents , PDFs , text files and images and select the `` Send to Kindle '' option . Multiple files can be sent in this way , meaning it 's potentially a big time saver for Kindle power users . There 's also the option to send documents from the print menu by selecting `` Send to Kindle '' from the list of installed printers . At the moment , Send to Kindle is Windows-only , so Mac users will have to keep doing it the hard way for the time being . Documents can also be stored in the Kindle Library cloud service for downloading later , or across multiple devices . Currently the only reading application supported is the Kindle App for iPad , iPhone and iPod Touch . Send to Kindle for PC is available to download free from Amazonnow .

Amazon has joined the UltraViolet movie project ( aka the Saviour of Hollywood ) , working with at least one studio to offer its films under the UltraViolet banner . UltraViolet , which landed in the UK on Boxing Day , is intended to allow us to buy a physical copy of a film from any retailer and get a digital copy which is stored in the cloud and streamed to our many and varied devices whenever and wherever we fancy it . Getting Amazon on board will be a huge boon to UltraViolet given its mammoth size and interest in media streaming to the Kindle Fire , and the mega-retailer is currently working with an unnamed studio to sell its films in UltraViolet format . `` The best movie and TV service for consumers is the one that provides them with the broadest choice possible , '' said Bill Carr , Amazon 's VP of digital media . `` We 're very excited about the additional possibilities from a customer 's point of view that UV enables . '' Other companies currently involved in the project include Lovefilm , Warner Brothers , Universal and Sony Pictures , while Disney is notably absent from the roster . From Business Week

The new Nikon D4 , which was available for pre-order on Amazon US , appears to have sold out already , giving an early indication of the popularity of the camera . Initially available for pre-order on the site for $ 5,999.00 , according to NikonRumors , the site stopped accepting orders after less than an hour , changing to `` Temporarily out of stock '' and later `` Currently unavailable '' . The Nikon D4 was officially announced early this morning after months of speculation and leaks regarding the specs . In the UK , there is no listing for the D4 appearing on Amazon as yet , however Warehouse Express is offering the camera for pre-order at £4799.00 . Photographers will be able to get their hands on the camera from February 16th , with Nikon UK claiming that it expects to see good stock delivery and anticipates no problems fulfilling a rush of orders . Canon , which announced its latest pro model , the Canon EOS 1DX back in October 2011 is also available for pre-order on the site for £5299.00 , however the camera is n't expected to start shipping until March . Both companies are set to have a big presence at the London 2012 Olympics , with both offering services for professional photographers using their cameras on site . Via NikonRumors

It 's yet to even launch in the UK but the Wi-Fi only 8GB PS Vita has topped Amazon.co.uk 's bestseller chart on pre-orders alone . Hitting the shops tomorrow , PS Vita-related goods currently hold 70 per cent of the retailer 's top 20 video game pre-order charts , as Liz Hosmer , manager of video games at Amazon.co.uk explains : `` 14 of the top 20 positions in our video games pre-order chart are held by the PlayStation Vita console , games and accessories , which clearly illustrates the level of excitement that we are seeing around the product . `` The release of a console is always big news and the buzz created around the new technology and enhanced gameplay has ensured that the PlayStation Vita is a bestseller in our charts before it has even been released . '' Released in Japan back in December 2011 , the PS Vita lands in the UK and US tomorrow , 22 February , with Vodafone nabbing the 3G exclusive in the UK . We 're big fans of the handheld console , as you 'll see in our PS Vita review which garnered Sony 's gizmo a healthy four stars . In fact , we went as far as to call it , `` the most powerful , dazzling and impressive handheld games console ever built . '' And you can check it out in action in our hands on video below :

Lovefilm 's days may be numbered as speculation rises about Amazon creating a global video service . Lovefilm is also shedding management . Last week , Lovefilm 's CEO Simon Calver stepped down , while today it emerges that the company 's chief technology officer , Mike Blakemore , is leaving to join the Guardian . That might not sound like much , but two of a business 's top brass ditching Lovefilm within a week is pretty dodgy going for any company . This staffing shuffle has led some to speculate that Lovefilm 's days as a stand alone brand may be numbered – it has already been bought by Amazon and the latest thinking is that the retail behemoth will completely absorb it in the near future . Amazon has already been bolstering its US streaming service as it adds to its Kindle Fire media arsenal . And you can bet that it 'll want to bring all its streaming products under one banner at some point . At that point , Lovefilm would cease to be . The question is , is that point coming soon ?

Amazon will launch a 9-inch Amazon Kindle Fire tablet , as well as a refreshed 7-inch model by the middle of this year , according to one analyst 's forecast . Chad Bartley of Pacific Crest has increased his Kindle Fire 2012 sales estimate from 12 million units to 14.9 miilion units , partly due to the expected new models . `` We are raising our 2012 sales forecasts to 14.9 million from 12.7 million , '' he wrote in a note to investors . `` But we believe there is an upward bias , particularly from the new 7 and 9-inch models , which we expect to launch in mid-2012 . '' A 9-inch Kindle Fire model would perhaps allow Amazon to take on larger tablets like the iPad , having already cornered the mid-sized market with its exceptionally-good-value , $ 199 , 7-inch Android offering . Despite selling an estimated six million Kindle Fire tablets during the holiday season alone , it is not seen as cutting into Apple 's slice of the action as the company announced record iPad sales for the three months leading up to Christmas . A 9-inch model , probably priced around $ 250 , would give perhaps tablet buyers a little more food for thought before splurging on an iPad 3 , which is expected to launch in about a month 's time . A new-and-improved 7-inch version of the Android tablet is likely to include many of the features Amazon left out first time around in order to get the first device out for Christmas . Check out our Amazon Kindle Fire 2 rumour round-up for some indication of what we could see in any new models . Via : AllThingsD

Amazon is reportedly on the verge of announcing a streaming deal with Viacom , which could signal the launch of a standalone video on demand offering . According to Reuters , Viacom which owns MTV , Comedy Central , Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon , has agreed to license its content to the Amazon and a deal will be announced soon . That deal could be the final piece in the puzzle for Amazon to go full-steam ahead with the heavily-tipped VoD subscription service . The company , which already has deals in place with the likes of Warner Bros , Fox , Sony , NBC and other top networks , currently offers its content library free to members of its $ 79-a-year home delivery service . However , Amazon wants to offer the service to non-Prime members ( probably for a monthly fee ) , in order to boost the Amazon Kindle Fire 's content library , according to the Reuters article . An Amazon Prime monthly subscription service would put the company in direct competition with the current kingpin of home streaming , Netflix . Netflix , which endured a largely forgettable 2011 , is seeing more and more competitors arrive on the scene looking for a piece of the lucrative streaming pie . Earlier this week we reported on the new alliance between Verizon and Redbox , which will see the companies launch a new service which will combine access to Redbox 's disc rental kiosks and an all-new on-demand offering from Verizon . With Apple and Google also pressing for a chunk of the action , Netflix is going to have to be on top of its game in 2012 to maintain the lion 's share of the market . Via : Reuters

Amazon failed to meet the expectations of traders this week , announcing that its fourth quarter profits declined 57 per cent . While its shares dropped 8.8 per cent on the announcement , it put the numbers down to a wave of mass expansion . The online retailer announced that its profits had slumped , making just £112.4 million in net income , but sales of its Kindle range were looking more than rosy . Total sales from the company rose 55 per cent but when it comes to the Amazon Kindle its numbers were up 177 per cent year on year to £11 billion . The Kindle was once again the most popular product sold through Amazon , with twice as many sold as in 2010 . When it comes to the Kindle Fire , Amazon has yet again failed to deliver any concrete numbers on the device but did go onto say that it was `` very encouraged '' by the tablet 's figures . It was just about digital , though , with Amazon noting that Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 on DVD was its second most popular product sold through its website . Looking forward , Amazon believes it will make anything between a loss of $ 200 million , to a profit of $ 100 million in the first quarter of 2012 . We 're guessing the company has its fingers crossed for the latter . Via the Guardian

While the outside world panic-buys pasties , we 've got greater things on our minds : new stuff ! For tech fans the last week 's been like Christmas : we 've been inundated with exciting new things . The most obviously exciting shiny new thing is the Techradar website itself , which has been completely redesigned - and we mean redesigned in a `` Windows 8 Metro '' way , not a `` New Apple TV user interface '' way . As Editor Paul Douglas explains , `` There was a lot of content on the old site , but finding it was n't always that simple . '' Now , it is . The Techradar site is faster , cleaner and can get even the most stubborn stains out of your clothes at just thirty degrees . We 're not the only shiny thing that 's got people excited this week . The new Sony Alpha e57 camera is looking pretty tasty , as is the new Nikon D800 . As Amy Davies says , the D800 is `` probably one of the most highly anticipated DSLRs , and most widely rumoured cameras , of the past few months '' . Now it 's finally official we 've got one squirrelled away in our labs , and Davies has been uploading stacks of images as well as a video run-down for your excitement and delightment . There 's also a new and shiny Apple thing : the new Apple TV , which our Apple expert Graham Barlow looked at until his eyes went boggly . That , er , distinctive interface aside , it looks like the new Apple TV is a pretty solid bit of kit , but he was honest about its shortcomings : if you 've got other Apple kit it 's a handy thing to have - `` at this price you should really consider getting one because it integrates wonderfully with your current setup '' , but `` for everyone else , even with the addition of 1080p HD , there 's no compelling reason to buy an Apple TV over other media streamers right now . '' Meanwhile Apple 's arch-enemy Amazon is up to something : instead of a Kindle Fire 2 , it seems the retail giant intends to launch a Kindle Fire 2 , a Kindle Fire 2 and -- wait for it -- a Kindle Fire 2 . That 's what the latest reports suggest , anyway : the firm is apparently working on three Kindle tablets for three different price points . The cheapie gets an 800 x 600 seven inch display , the mid-range one a 1,280 x 800 seven-incher and the top-end one an 8.9inch , full HD 1,920 x 1,200 screen . No other details have leaked just yet , but they will sooner or later . Remember UltraViolet , the digital locker service that would take the movie business by storm by giving everybody a digital licence for the content they buy on disc ? While it has n't exactly set the world on fire , 20th Century Fox says it 's going to be a big deal - which is why it has n't provided any content to the service . Eh ? `` We have been working on UltraViolet since the beginning , and we view it as a very serious work in progress , '' the studio 's Danny Kaye said . `` We want to make sure that [ it ] is as good as it can be . '' There 's something of a chicken and egg scenario here , we reckon : Fox wo n't provide the content until the service is better and more widely supported , but the more content it has the better and more widely supported it will become . As Marc Chacksfield reports , the Fox executive vice president just wants to see a few tweaks : `` the improvements that need to be made are everything from how UltraViolet works [ to ] the support it has been given . '' In other words , it 's absolutely brilliant and every aspect of it needs to be changed . That 's promising , is n't it ? While Fox is n't currently providing content , Sony is : its first UK UltraViolet discs will ship in June . Meanwhile Dixons says UltraViolet is here to stay . Senior category manager Gary Hearns told us that the entire retail industry is behind the service . `` This thing is not going to disappear in 12-18 months . This is permanent , '' he said . Should we believe him ? Dixons , you may recall , told us that HD-DVD 's future had n't been decided when everybody and their dog were dumping it back in 2008 . To be honest , we did n't recall it either : we used Techradar.com 's new , improved search system . We told you the new site was good .

Fresh reports suggest that online retail giant Amazon is actually lining up three different models of its forthcoming Kindle Fire 2 tablet . We reported earlier this month that Amazon may be looking at releasing a 7-inch and 10-inch version of the Kindle Fire 2 , but news from Taiwan says you can add another one in there too . According to a number of Taiwanese publications we are set to see three versions of Amazon 's next Android-powered tablet : two 7-inch models and an 8.9-inch variant . It 's been reported that the 7-inch models will sport different screen resolutions , one with a budget-friendly 1024 x 600 display and the other with a mid-range 1280 x 800 screen . The larger 8.9-inch Amazon Kindle Fire 2 is said to pack a full HD ( 1920 x 1200 ) display – which is unprecedented for a sub 10-inch tablet ( the new iPad aside ) . No other details are known at this time , but if the reports are true expect the 8.9-inch version , with its HD display , to compete with the new iPad . Apple may be looking over its shoulder as Amazon 's Kindle Fire tablet was very competitively priced – and we expect the same from the next generation . From UnwiredView

Amazon believes that readers will be looking to pick up a Kindle Touch rather than wait for the Kindle Fire in the UK . The Kindle Touch will launch in the UK with a price of £169 for the 3G version , which means one of its direct competitors will be its stablemate the Kindle Fire when it finally makes an appearance in the UK . Although no date has been announced for the Kindle Fire UK release , Amazon is at pains to point to the differences between an e-ink device and a tablet . `` We do n't have anything to announce today [ in terms of the Kindle Fire arriving in the UK ] but from a US perspective we know that our customers love Kindle Fire and are really excited about it , '' said an Amazon spokesperson . `` But we think customers in the UK are going to like the Touch – we saw that in the US despite having the full range of devices . `` This is built for readers , whereas the Kindle Fire is built for entertainment . '' Persuading people to buy a Touch is likely to rest around how fond people are of e-ink , something that Amazon is keenly aware of . `` It 's a reader 's device , '' reiterated the spokesperson . `` People love the eInk technology and the fact you can read in the sun without glare . `` When people are big readers they do n't want to put up with glare or things beeping at them from another app . `` It 's ... something we purposely did on these devices – you do n't get distracted . '' It 's clear that Amazon will have to persuade the technophile audience that it is worth forking out a significant proportion of a Kindle Fire 's cost for the e-reader . In the US , there is a price difference of $ 50 ( around £30 ) between the $ 149 3G touch and the $ 199 Kindle Fire , although the price of the Touch is significantly upped for the UK . However , Amazon suggests that people are actually choosing to carry a laptop and a Kindle , rather than just a Kindle Fire which , technically , could replace both . `` We 're finding people are bringing a laptop and then they choose between a Kindle or a tablet and a lot of times they are bringing a Kindle - so it 's very interesting .

The upcoming Amazon Kindle Fire 2 tablet may be about to enter production in Taiwan after an order from the online-retailer was leaked . According to sources in the upstream supply chain , Taiwanese chassis manufacturer Catcher has received an order from Amazon for a new Kindle Fire tablet . No further details were provided , leaving us in the dark over how many units may have been ordered and what possible specifications Amazon 's next tablet will sport . It 's thought that if the leaked order is real , and there 's absolutely no guarantee that it is , then production of the Amazon Kindle Fire 2 could start very soon . We reported at the start of the month that Amazon could be working on two variants of the Kindle Fire 2 , a 7-inch model and a 10-inch version to compete with the likes of the new iPad . The original Kindle Fire sold strongly in the US , mainly thanks to its low price tag , but it has failed to make it to the UK . We expect the Kindle Fire 2 to grace us with its presence here in Britain , as Amazon looks to tackle the global tablet market . Check out our Kindle Fire 2 rumour round up below , for what you may be able to expect from Amazon 's next tablet . From Digitimes

The Nikon D800 has climbed to number 21 in Amazon UK 's list of best-selling cameras , before it is even available to buy . Looking at DSLRs only , it is the second highest seller , beaten only by the Canon EOS 550D , a budget entry-level DSLR . The Nikon D800 was launched back in February , and is the world 's highest resolution full-frame camera , featuring 36 million pixels . Currently , the Amazon listing shows that it is due for release on March 26th . Retailing for £2,399 , it is unusual to see such an expensive camera selling so well on Amazon , which finds most of its camera business through point and shoot cameras and entry level DSLRs . Amazon 's top 20 cameras sales list includes 19 compact cameras and the Canon EOS 550D . Amazon is not currently offering the more expensive pro Nikon D4 , which retails for around £4,800 elsewhere . Earlier in the month , Nikon told us that pre-orders for the D800 have been 'unprecedented ' , meanwhile possibly its biggest rival , the Canon 5D Mark III is not currently available for sale on Amazon . The next best-selling DSLRs in the top 40 are the Nikon D3100 , Canon EOS 600D and Nikon D5100 , all entry-level cameras . There are no compact system cameras currently in the Amazon UK top 40 best-sellers , however the Panasonic G3 tops the separate list of CSCs .

The Amazon Kindle is by far the best e-reader on the market right now and , if you love reading , you want one . You might not realise it yet , but you do . In fact , we 'll go one step further . If you 've avoided it until now out of a totally understandable desire to hang on to traditional ink-and-paper books , you 're actually the perfect candidate for one . That may seem strange . After all , for keen readers physical books are special in a way that no digital file can ever hope to be , are n't they ? A lump of plastic can never offer the same smell , the same texture and tactile experience as traditional paper . An ebook file can surely never hold the same memories as a beloved paperback . This is only part of the story though . What the Kindle lacks in traditional charms , it makes up for in many other ways , like convenience . It holds well over 1,000 books in a device that 's more portable than the average paperback . When you buy a book , you get it instantly , with no need to head into town or wait three days for delivery . You can even get the first chapter or so of every book in the Kindle store for free , and shop with the confidence that nobody on your commute will be able to see you 're reading Twilight instead of The Brothers Karamazov . And the list goes on . For access to books , you ca n't beat Kindle . And if you miss paper ? Use that as well . Nobody says it has to be an either/or lifestyle . One of the biggest misconceptions about the Kindle is the quality of its screen . It 's nothing like trying to read from your monitor or a device like the Apple iPad , neither of which is much fun . Instead , it uses a technology called E Ink , which is much closer to the experience of reading ink on paper than pixels on a traditional screen . Also unlike an LCD , it only requires energy when you change the display , giving incredible battery life . To put this in context , the iPad lasts 10 hours between charges . The Kindle can easily go for a month . As part of this technology , there 's no backlighting or glass on the Kindle - and both omissions are for the best . Only with E Ink can you can read in bed without blasting your eyes with light that will keep you awake later ( or annoying a sleeping partner ) , as well as in typically tablet hostile environments like the beach . The only disadvantages of these are that you do have to provide your own light to read with , and the screen is too fragile to go without a case . Amazon 's own cases are good , but expensive . You can find much cheaper ones , so do shop around before handing over your cash . The downsides of going electronic are few and far between , but are worth noting . You ca n't lend or give away ( most ) ebooks , or borrow them from others . Your collection is also tied to one company and thus , at least in part , subject to its whims , though Amazon is a reasonably safe bet . The final , oddest issue , is cost . Firstly , ebooks are n't recognised as 'real ' books by the government , and are therefore subject to 20 per cent VAT , unlike paper books . There 's also no second-hand market for data , and publishers have complete control over their pricing . To take one recent example , the Anthony Horowitz novel The House of Silk officially costs £18.99 in hardback , but Amazon sells it for £8.36 . For Kindle , it 's £9.99 . On price , paper - ridiculously - still often wins . When you buy your Kindle from Amazon , it arrives pre-registered to your Amazon account . All you have to do to set it up is point it to your Wi-Fi network and enter the password . Any books that you 've already purchased will be automatically downloaded to it , and you 're ready to start reading . If you were bought one as a gift , or picked one up from a store like Argos , you 'll have to log in once to tell it who you are , but otherwise the process is identical . That 's as technical as it gets . You can buy books straight from the device by opening the menu and choosing 'Shop in Kindle Store ' , but it 's easier to do it from a web browser . Every Kindle book on the Amazon storefront has two options – 'Buy Now With 1-Click ' ( with the option to choose a Kindle or Kindle app , though you can download it on any you 've registered ) and 'Send Sample Now ' . Samples vary dramatically in generosity ( with non-fiction books especially having an annoying habit of only giving you the intro ) but are a good way to try out new authors . When browsing , the 'Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought ' box is a great way of finding some . Switch on your Kindle and , as long as it can connect to your network , your books should auto-download . If not , open the menu and select 'Sync & Check For Items ' to give it a quick nudge . Assuming you 're not on the Touch model , pressing up and down on the keypad navigates through books , pressing left gives you the option to delete them , and pressing right brings up a longer menu to file books into Collections or order the full version if you enjoyed a sample enough to want to order the full thing . One caveat though : book purchases are one-click affairs with no 'Are you Sure ? ' or password check . The confirmation screen has a 'Purchased by Accident ? ' button , but you 'll still want to be careful of letting children/careless friends play with your Kindle without supervision . Play Audiobooks And other audio files too ! While it will sap the battery far faster than reading plain E Ink books , the Kindle Keyboard and Touch can play MP3 files , as well as full audiobooks from Audible.co.uk ( which Amazon owns ) . In both cases though , you will need to connect the Kindle up to your computer to sync them across , using Audible 's software to transfer those files . Read your books aloud As long as the publisher has n't switched off the option , and you do n't mind being subjected to the robot version of Jackanory , the Kindle Touch/Keyboard can read out your books using a synthesised voice . You 'll find the option on the font-control screen , with a choice of male or female voice and speed of talking . Choose it and it starts automatically . Read non-Amazon books Kindle supports its own copy-protected files and .mobi ebook format , along with plain text , HTML and PDFs . If you have an ( unprotected ) book in a different format though , typically .epub , all is not lost . Download Calibre and you can convert the file . To copy supported files on your own , such as HTML files from Project Gutenberg or similar , just connect the Kindle to your PC via USB and drag-and-drop them into the 'documents ' directory . Browse the web It 's not a great browsing experience , but it 's doable . Open the 'Menu ' , then go to the 'Experimental ' option and you 'll see a web browser . If you have the 3G model , it 'll work anywhere , if not , you 'll need to use a Wi-Fi connection . Read web articles Visit www.instapaper.com , create an account , and follow its instructions to find your Kindle 's email address . Now browse the internet as normal , pressing the 'Instapaper ' button in your browser when you find an interesting article you do n't have time for . Instapaper bundles them up and sends a Kindle-friendly version every day . Handy ! Ease collection pains Sorting books into Collections is a tedious process on the E Ink screen . You can save some time in the future though by importing your collections between devices , ensuring you only have to do it once or twice . Alternatively , do n't bother with Collections at all . Set your Kindle to show you newest first , and use Search to find old books . Play Minesweeper A slightly silly Easter egg , but still one that 's fun to know about . If you have the Keyboard version of the Kindle , press [ Alt ] and [ Shift ] and [ M ] simultaneously to bring up this classic game . From the Minesweeper screen , you can also play a game of 5-in-a-Row against your Kindle . A good way to kill time on a journey if you 're not in the mood for reading . Crash Yes , your Kindle may occasionally freeze up . If so , do n't panic . Hold the power switch to the side until it resets ( 10-30 seconds ) , then flick it again if necessary to turn it on . Obviously , if this happens a lot - and it should n't - give Amazon a call to see if your unit is defective . Take screenshots On the Kindle keyboard , press [ Alt ] and [ Shift ] and [ G ] to take a screenshot , and on the Kindle Touch , hold the Home button for three seconds , tap the screen and release the button . The image is saved on your Kindle , and can be found by plugging it into a computer and opening the device in Explorer or Finder . Why would you want to do this ? It 's an easy way to copy/paste for reference or sharing .

Amazon has boosted its on-demand Instant Video service for Prime members by signing a major new licensing deal with the Discovery network of channels . Subscribers can now access over 3,000 new titles from the Discovery Channel , Animal Planet , TLC and more from the company 's 25-year content library . Among the new shows available to view over a range of connected devices , including the Amazon Kindle Fire , include Whale Wars , Say Yes To The Dress and Dirty Jobs . The addition brings Amazon 's on-demand offering to 17,000 titles , up 12,000 from the original launch last year . That 's in addition to the 120,000 TV shows and movies now available to purchase or rent . Speculation persists that Amazon is preparing to launch a standalone subscription service , away from the Prime scheme , which currently offers offers free access to anyone signed up to the company 's annual free delivery service . Such a launch would heap the pressure on Netflix , which is under scrutiny from members who want more streaming content following a disappointing 2011 for the company Via : TechCrunch

The Amazon Kindle Fire 2 looks like it will be landing in both an 8.9-inch and 10-inch flavour when launched later this year . Digitimes sources state the online shopping giant will shift its focus away from ebook readers and concentrate on the rapidly expanding tablet market with a successor to the 7-inch Kindle Fire and a bigger 10-inch device . Amazon has witnessed strong sales of its first Kindle Fire tablet , seeing 3.98 million units fly off the shelves in the last quarter of 2011 – leading to a 14 % share of the global tablet market , according to market data . The source also claimed that Amazon has reduced its E Ink orders ( the fancy screen technology found on Kindle e-readers ) , raising speculation that it could shift solely to its Kindle Fire tablets . Previous reports have hinted that the Kindle Fire 2 may rock an 8.9-inch screen , but this latest leak suggests this will be replaced with a 10-inch model . It is still unclear what Amazon 's tablets plans are going forward , but we expect it to launch a bigger screened model to compete with the likes of the new iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 .

Amazon announced its first quarter earnings , which beat profit estimates thanks to strong Kindle Fire sales . First the bad news : Amazon 's profits are down overall at $ 130 million ( £80 million ) net income compared to last year 's Q1 net income of $ 201 million ( £123 million ) . Amazon attributes the drop to the company 's various investments , such as fulfillment centers , web services infrastructure and video content rights . Here 's the good news : that the $ 130 million ( £80 million ) , which translates to 28 cents per share , beats the online giant 's first quarter estimate of reaching 6 cents per share . Meanwhile , revenue grew 34 percent to $ 13.18 billion ( £8.5 billion ) beating expectations set for $ 12.91 billion ( £7.94 billion ) . The Kindle Fire was the star of Amazon 's first quarter , taking the top spot as Amazon 's best-selling item . As a result , Amazon saw a 17 percent increase in media sales that are mostly attributed to customers filling their new Kindle Fire with digital movies and books . Looking ahead , Amazon is estimating revenue in its second quarter to grow between 20 to 34 percent , or between $ 11.9 billion to $ 13.3 billion ( £7.3 billion to £ 8.1 billion ) .

A quick search for books on Amazon may yield unexpected results , with numerous copycat titles appearing alongside their legitimate bestseller counterparts . Knockoff titles such as Twilight New Moon , I am the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo , and Thirty-Five Shades of Gray are increasingly common to fool unassuming readers into buying the wrong book . Some do n't even bother to change the title , such as the now removed knockoff Steve Jobs credited to Isaac Worthington , ripping off Walter Isaacson 's bestseller . Shared in common between the knockoffs is Amazon 's CreateSpace tool and service . CreateSpace makes it easy for authors to self-publish their books through Amazon and other sites , with proceeds split between the author and Amazon . Of course , not all CreateSpace books are copycats and scams , but a significant number of those scam books list CreateSpace as their publisher . When other media outlets approached Amazon about the surge in knockoffs , the retailer removed many of the offending titles . However , it raises questions about Amazon 's screening process , if one exists , and whether steps will be taken to prevent book scams from appearing on Amazon in the future . With Amazon receiving a cut from CreateSpace published books , it seems the responsibility should fall on Amazon to better monitor its service rather than relying on publishers to react only after copycats are found .

Now that Amazon has taken a big leap into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire , the etailer may spread some of that joy around with some rumored improvements to its line of ereaders . The rumor is that Amazon 's next Kindle models will feature a `` glowing '' display , which would jettison the traditional E-Ink screen above a `` front-lit Kindle '' to debut later this year . Adding fuel to the Kindle `` glowing '' display rumors are published reports claiming that Amazon already ordered `` millions '' of these new Kindle ereaders from display maker E-Ink Holdings -- and specifically they will feature a color screen this time around . Of course , Amazon already made the big leap to color with the backlit Kindle Fire , but a color E-Ink model would appeal to users who prefer reading to watching movies and TV shows . So what will happen to the classic black and white E-Ink Kindle ? In March , LG began manufacturing `` a flexible plastic E-Ink display with a 1024 by 768-pixel resolution , '' which many believe may find a home in the cheaper Kindle models that do n't require a glass screen for protection .

Nokia 's brand new Lumia 900 has officially become Amazon 's top-selling phone , beating out Motorola 's Razr Maxx and Samsung 's Galaxy Nexus , two of Android 's top phones , for the top spot . The black Lumia 900 has remained steadily at No.1 all day , though the Cyan version has fluctuated between second and third . The Lumia launched over the weekend , and Nokia celebrated by taking over Times Square on Friday evening . The Finnish company commandeered nine of the New York landmark 's enormous LED displays and projected 200-foot graphics displays onto numerous buildings . A-list singer Nicki Minaj was even on hand as a `` secret guest . '' Techradar reviewed the Galaxy and Razr Maxx favorably , though both phones were found to be not without faults . Technological superiority likely is n't the only factor in the Lumia 's recent dominance , though . Lumia release on Easter weekend raises eyebrows The phone 's Easter launch has been questioned numerous times , including by the NYT Bits blog , who noted that most retailers selling the phone ( including most of New York 's 39 AT & T stores ) were closed on the national holiday . But that may have helped boost online sales of the Windows phone by leading frustrated customers to head to Amazon rather than wait a day until the physical stores once again opened their doors . Lumia 's price point driving popularity Another factor is likely the Lumia 's affordable price point . At just $ 49.99 with a two-year contract from AT & T , it 's $ 20 cheaper than the Galaxy and a whopping $ 150 less than the Razr Maxx . It 's also $ 50 cheaper to purchase the phone on Amazon than directly from AT & T , a distinction consumers were n't likely to miss . Windows phones are historically popular on Amazon , as well , with the top three slots for highest-rated phone currently occupied by the HTC Trophy , the HTC Titan and the Samsung Focus , all running on Windows . Only two of the top ten are Nokia devices , although they 're both Lumias — the 710 in white and black at No.9 and No.10 , respectively . If the Lumia 900 continues on its current path , it 'll likely join their ranks soon . Via TechCrunch , NYT Bits Blog

Microsoft announced a new partnership that will allow Xbox 360 owners to access Amazon 's massive selection of streaming video content from their gaming consoles . With an Xbox Live Gold account ( $ 60 annually ) and an Amazon Prime membership ( $ 79 per year ) , Xbox 360 users can hop on the console 's free Amazon Instant Video app and access more than 17,000 streaming movies and TV shows . Buying and renting videos on demand is currently not supported from the Xbox 360 app itself , users without an Amazon Prime membership can purchase one of the 100,000-plus streaming movies and TV shows by visiting Amazon.com/instantvideo . Once purchased , the videos appear instantly on the Xbox 360 app 's Watch List . Amazon offers one-month free trials of Amazon Prime for users who 'd like to try the service out . Amazon 's Instant Video service streams new episodes of many popular shows the day after they air , and the entire selection is now available on the Xbox 360 . The Amazon Instant app is also compatible with the Xbox 360 's optional Kinect peripheral , a sensor-equipped device that allows users to control video selection and playback with arm gestures and voice commands . What 's more , the Xbox 360 's Amazon Instant Video app can work in tandem with Amazon 's Kindle Fire tablet . The devices will remember video playback positions , making it easy to switch between them for portable or living room viewing . The Amazon Instant Video app is free to download , and it 's now displayed prominently on the Xbox 360 's `` Apps '' tab , just a button press ( or gesture or voice command for Kinect users ) away . Amazon 's UK streaming service Lovefilm just announced a multi-year streaming deal with Universal , a partnership that will further fuel the war between Netflix and Lovefilm that 's already spawned several other exclusive deals in the UK . Lovefilm videos will be streaming in 720p , and an Amazon spokesperson confirmed to TechRadar via email that Amazon Instant videos streaming to the Xbox 360 in the US are available in full HD . The Amazon Instant Video App brought free Amazon Prime content and paid on-demand movies and TV shows to the Sony 's PlayStation 3 in April , but this is the first time the app has been available on the Xbox 360 .

Amazon has come to terms with the Independent Publishers Group following a dispute that saw 5,000 titles removed from the Kindle store . The spat began in February when IPG refused to a agree to a new contract which would have `` substantially '' reduced earnings for authors on ebooks and paper titles sold on Amazon . Reports also suggested that IPG was unhappy with what Amazon was offering , compared with what other publishers in the marketplace were receiving . The failure to reach an agreement saw the ebook giant remove IPG 's titles from the Kindle Store , but continue to sell the paper versions . After long negotiations a deal as now been brokered and the titles are starting to return to the online portal , but not much is known about the terms of the new deal . The agreement comes following an intense few weeks of controversy over the relationships between publishers and ebook retailers . Last month Apple and five of the world 's biggest publishing houses were sued by the US justice department over allegations they colluded to fix ebook prices . Some of the publishers chose to settle out of court while Apple , Macmillan and Penguin intend to fight the writ in court . Via : The Verge

Android users who frequent the Amazon Appstore will now be able to sample apps right on their device . With the version 2.6.53 update to the Amazon Appstore , users will have access to Amazon 's Test Drive feature through their phone . Test Drive launched as a feature for Amazon 's web store last year . It works by launching a copy of the desired app from the company 's Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) , allowing users to test new apps without needing to download them first . Now , that feature arrives directly through Amazon 's Appstore on smartphones . Test Drive on Android still streams the app from Amazon EC2 , so it does n't exactly offer an accurate sampling of how apps will perform on various devices . However , testing an app right on your phone is certainly a step closer to the real thing than a simulated version running on your PC . The catch is that not all apps support Test Drive yet . Though the PC Appstore has more than 16,000 apps supported , the Android phone launch will offer 5,000 Test Drive capable apps . Test Drive in the Amazon Appstore will also only work on `` select phone models '' for now , with compatibility for more devices to be added over the next few months . But , Amazon has n't specified which phone models are included in the initial launch . That being said , Amazon marks this launch as the Test Drive Android beta , with more support on the way . As support for more devices and apps are added , the Test Drive button will automatically be added to each app 's store page . Google Play , which was formerly the Android Market , only offers a 15 minute cooling off period to return an app once purchased . Once more app and device support arrives , Test Drive 's instant app trials could draw a lot of new customers to favor the Amazon Appstore over Google 's own option .

Amazon will launch a 10.1-inch iteration of its popular Kindle Fire tablet in the third quarter of 2012 , according to new reports . Digitimes reckons the company plans to take on the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 after cornering the 7-inch tablet market with the original Kindle Fire . A 10.1-inch tablet , especially if priced similarly to the $ 199 ( £125 ) Kindle Fire , may raise a few eyebrows over at Apple HQ , with the demand for cheap , functional tablets extremely high . Apple itself is rumoured to be going after the Kindle Fire with a 7-inch iPad mini later this year . Supposedly , Amazon had been planning a more modest size upgrade to 8.9-inches with its second offering , but that has now been shelved , says Digitimes . Overall , the company expects to ship up to 40 million tablets in 2012 . Not a bad return is it ? Via : Digitimes

Online retail giant Amazon is readying its Kindle Fire 2 tablet for the festive period and it could sport a larger 8.9-inch display . If you 're already thinking about Christmas then firstly , shame on you , but secondly , Amazon may have the answer to your gift-giving conundrums . The news comes via a Reuters source , who claims `` Amazon plans to launch a new tablet closer to the holiday season later this year '' . It 's been suggested that the increase in screen size is an attempt by Amazon to challenge Apple 's 9.7-inch iPad range , which currently dominates the market . However the Amazon Kindle Fire offers a simple , budget option for those US consumers unable to stump up the cash for the extravagant new iPad or even the iPad 2 . The Kindle Fire 2 is expected to make the dash across the pond and land in the UK and the rest of Europe , with hopefully the same low price tag , as Amazon looks to take on the worldwide market . Find out all the information about Amazon 's next tablet in our Amazon Kindle Fire 2 release date , news and rumours article , or take a look at the video below . From Reuters

The black and white world of e-reading is about to get a bit more colourful : Amazon is reportedly planning an Amazon Kindle Colour for the second half of this year . If you believe the rumours – and they 've come from Digitimes ' ever-chatty supply chain sources , so we 'll forgive you if you do n't – the colour Kindles will come with multi-touch capacitive touchscreens . That 's a little different to the existing infrared panels used in the Kindle Touch which offer only shades of grey . ( Not the controversial book , Fifty Shades of Grey . Although you can get that on Kindle too . ) Gosh , it 's just like when films got colour . Join us as we party like it 's 1917 . Digitimes also reports that E Ink will have some colour products available soon , which are likely to be the panels that end up in the Amazon Kindle Colour . While rumours have also begun swirling of a new Amazon Kindle Fire , only the US currently has the illusive Android tablet to play with . The latest from the Amazon rumour mill is that there will be three different models of the Kindle Fire 2 , two 7-inch slates and either an 8.9- or a 10-incher . But despite the popularity of the tablet line-up so far , plenty of people still prefer to do their ereading on an ebook reader so we would n't be surprised to see the rumoured colour version arrive in time for Christmas spending season .

A leaked internal memo revealed earlier today that Target will no longer stock Amazon- or Kindle-branded products as of May 13 . Whatever stock remains after that day will be sold off and not replenished . Read more : Amazon Kindle Paperwhite review Sources cite a `` conflict of interest '' as the reason for the move , though Target 's statement does n't shed much light on the situation : `` Target continually evaluates its product assortment to deliver the best quality and prices for our guests , '' the retailer said . `` Target is phasing out Kindles and Amazon- and Kindle-branded products in the spring of 2012 . We will continue to offer our guests a full assortment of ereaders and supporting accessories including the Nook . '' One possible source of the conflict between the Amazon Kindle and Target stores is the fact that Apple and Target recently partnered up to build Apple `` mini-stores '' in 25 Target locations this year . Apple and Amazon have n't exactly been buddies lately . The Department of Justice recently filed an antitrust suit against Apple and five major book publishers for colluding to keep Apple 's e-book prices lower than those on Amazon and similar retailers . Apple promised to stick to their guns and defend themselves in court in the matter , so it 's not a stretch to assume that they 're not happy with Amazon at the moment . It does seem slightly far-fetched , though , that they 'd be able to convince Target to cease all ties with the Kindle , which has historically sold well at the retailer . What makes the move even stranger is the fact that rumors are swirling about Amazon 's Kindle Fire 2 , the successor to the Kindle Fire that could drop as early as this Spring . The Kindle Fire 2 will no doubt sell like hotcakes , so why Target would choose now to break off their relationship with Amazon is a mystery . The Kindle Fire and Apple 's iPad are n't even in the same price range , after all . Unless , of course , the next Kindle Fire will indeed carry that rumored quad-core Tegra , in which case it 's going to cost more than the current Kindle 's $ 200 . Amazon 's Kindle Fire can still be found in physical retail stores including Best Buy , Walmart and Staples . Via The Verge

Amazon 's Kindle Fire is a hot seller , so will the company tackle smartphones next ? The Kindle Fire tablet doubled its share of the Android tablet market earlier this year , jumping to 54 percent of all Android-based tablets in February . So , some analysts say that a smartphone is the next logical step for Amazon 's hardware division . Citigroup 's Mark Mahaney released a report last year that claimed Chinese factories including Foxconn already have an Amazon phone in the works , and that it would launch in Q4 2012 . If it comes to fruition , Amazon would sell it at cost - $ 150 or $ 170 ( £92 or £104 ) . And with rumors of even a Facebook phone heating up , Amazon 's success with the Kindle Fire seems to point more and more every day to an impending grab at the smartphone market from the online giant . The Amazon phone would almost certainly run a modified version of Google 's Android OS , much like the retailer 's popular Kindle Fire , and would act as a direct portal to Amazon 's massive online store . Amazon 's shopping and Kindle apps are already available on iOS and Windows Phone devices , but Amazon 's affordable price point ( they 're already rumored to be selling the Kindle Fire at cost ) and perceived brand reliability could be enough to attract your average customers . But the idea of an Amazon phone is not without misgivings . There are a plethora of Android phones on the market currently , and Amazon could have trouble differentiating its own product from the pack . And if the Amazon phone uses a unique version of Android similar to that on the Kindle Fire , it could be unattractive to developers looking for the largest possible market . Furthermore , the streaming services that Amazon users take advantage of on their Wi-Fi-enabled Kindle Fires could eat away at an Amazon phone 's 3G or 4G data plan , analysts say . But with Amazon 's busy online storefront potentially serving as a free digital stage for the Amazon phone , much like it has for the Kindle Fire , Amazon may have all the advantage it needs in grabbing its share of the smartphone market .

Popular web services Netflix , Instagram and Pinterest all suffered downtime on Friday night thanks to an Amazon cloud server outage . Parts of the Amazon EC2 server , which hosts an alarmingly high percentage of the internet 's top content , went down in Virginia , United States , due to severe thunderstorms in the area . The outage was first acknowledged by the cloud provider at 11:21pm EST when , hopefully , most Brits would be unknowingly and comfortably snoozing the problem away . However , by 1:15am EST Amazon said it had resolved the issue : `` EC2 and EBS APIs are once again operating normally . We are continuing to recover impacted instances and volumes , '' said a statement from Amazon Web Services . Netflix came back online shortly after , while social networking site Pinterest and retro photo-sharing site Instagram also reappeared . So , if you 're a Statesider whose Friday night usually involves watching Arrested Development re-runs and taking filtered photos and uploading them to Facebook , last night was n't your night . The outage raises questions over the reliability of the servers , given that it was taken down by a little thunder and lightning , but let 's hope for better weather in North Virginia for the rest of the weekend .

Previous rumors that Amazon is adding new 7- and 10-inch models to its Kindle Fire line of tablets have been further teased by a new report . In the report , a `` trusted '' anonymous source claims that Amazon is readying two new Kindle Fire 2 models for release this summer , one of which is the long-rumored 10-inch Kindle Fire . The 10-inch Amazon Kindle Fire 2 , according to the source , will come packed with a more powerful quad-core processor . Both new Kindle Fire tablets will reportedly be of higher-quality materials and more ergonomic designs . The original Kindle Fire 's plastic body is being replaced by matte black metal , with a shiny , chrome-like `` rib '' on the back that looks sharp and feels better . The speakers are supposedly located here as well . `` It 's really up a notch from the current Fire , '' claims the source . Furthermore , the report says that Amazon 's new Kindle Fire 2 tablets will be thinner and more similar in appearance to the first-generation Apple iPad , but without any buttons on the front . In addition , the 10-inch Kindle Fire will house a front-facing camera , and both new tablets will include microUSB ports and , possibly , HDMI-out jacks , says the report . Google had the Amazon Kindle Fire in the crosshairs yesterday when they revealed the Google Nexus 7 tablet , a $ 199 device that focuses on media playback via the Google Play store . As far as price and functionality go , Google 's Nexus 7 tablet can easily compete with the existing Kindle Fire . And the Nexus 7 's specs surpass those of the Kindle Fire . But until Amazon reveals more about the upcoming 7- and 10-inch Kindle Fire 2s , it 's unclear which tablets will come out on top . `` The whole tablet market is due for a radical change over the next one to two quarters , '' J . Gold Associates analyst Jack Gold told TechRadar earlier this week . It looks like his prediction may prove to be spot-on . Via BGR

Amazon has begun inviting devs to submit apps for international distribution later this year . It does n't take a genius to work out that this probably means the Amazon Appstore is breaking free of its US-only bounds and heading to the rest of the world . The first countries to be getting this 'international app distribution ' are the United Kingdom , Germany , France , Italy and Spain , with further expansion planned for the near future . The Amazon App Store offers handy features like 1-click purchasing and try before you buy ( known as Test Drive ) of Android apps , things that Amazon reckons have contributed to its mega success in the US . `` Some developers have seen revenue double since the launch of In-App Purchasing , '' gushed Jim Adkins , VP of the Amazon Appstore . `` We 're excited to open the door to even more opportunity by expanding app sales outside the U.S. We see tremendous potential for current developers in our distribution program to grow with the international expansion . '' Developers can now submit apps to Amazon for approval by visiting the Amazon Mobile App Distribution Portal . News of the international plans jives nicely with a rumour that broke earlier this month , which predicted a European launch for the app portal this summer . Obviously we 're excited to speculate that this means the Kindle Fire is heading East too , although we would n't be surprised if Amazon decides to make the Kindle Fire 2 its European tablet debut rather than the original .

Amazon is reportedly set to relaunch its Cloud Player digital locker with an iTunes-Match style service thanks to new deals struck with record labels . The new version of Cloud Player is expected to land in the US in July with a European rollout reportedly set for later in the year . The original iteration of Amazon Cloud Player , which was only ever made available in the US , saw users uploading digital copies of their legit DRM-free music files and then streaming them from wherever . But the new deals , reportedly inked with the four major music labels ( Sony , Universal , EMI and Warner ) , will likely see Amazon able to scan a user 's music collection and make digital versions available without all the tedious uploading . All Amazon accounts come with 5GB of free Cloud Drive storage , with more available to purchase as and when you need it – although all Amazon MP3 purchases can be stored for free . The company only recently released an iOS app for the service , which means that iPhone , iPod and iPad users have only been able to take advantage of the space-saving streaming for a couple of weeks .

The Amazon Kindle Fire tablet may be cut to just $ 150 ( £100 ) as the company looks to boost the line-up with new models , according to reports . Digitimes reports that the online giant plans to knock $ 50 ( £30 ) off the base price in order to facilitate a new 7-incher later this year and 8.9-inch and 10.1-inch models , perhaps in early 2013 . According to the article , which cites supply chain sources , the new 7-inch iteration will boast a better screen ( 1200 x 800 resolution ) and ' a more competent computing platform , ' with a price point of $ 199 . A lower-priced Kindle Fire would put further pressure on rival Android tablet manufacturers to offer their own wares at a cheaper rates . Amazon has dominated the lower-end tablet market with hugely impressive Kindle Fire sales since its launch in November 2011 . The etailer , unlike rivals Samsung , Motorola and LG , can afford to take losses on the hardware as makes back more than its share in ebooks , app sales and Amazon Prime subscriptions .

ICANN has revealed the companies and people behind the near-2000 proposed new domain names for the web and , unsurprisingly , two tech heavyweights crop up the most : Google and Amazon . TechRadar has combed through the extensive list and found some interesting potential domain names both Google and Apple have proposed to ICANN , some of which both companies are vying for . When it comes to Amazon , the electronic retailer has gone for an impressive 76 domain names , including its own name and brands such as Kindle and Fire , as well as some oddities - such as jot , room and smile . The rest are as follows : app , Audible , author , book , bot , box , buy , call , circle , cloud , coupon , deal , dev , drive , fast , fire , free , game , got , group , hot , jot , joy , kids , like , mail , map , mobile , movie , music , news , now , play , pin , pay , read , room , safe , save , search , secure , shop , show , smile , song , spot , store , talk , tunes , video , wow , you , zero . Google 's Sarah Falveyhas also been busy proposing new domain names to go alongside the likes of .com and .co.uk . In total , Google went for 90 or so , with some of its proposals overlapping with Amazon . The pick of the bunch for us were as follows : Google , Goog , And , Android , app , are , baby , blog , boo , book , buy , car , channel , cloud , dad , day , dev , diy , dog , dot , drive , eat , esq , family , film , fly , foo , free , fun , FYI , game , here , home , how , kid , live , lol , love , meme , moto , movie , music , pet , prod , prof , RSVP , search , show , site , soy , spot , store , Talk , tech , web and wow . The overlaps are definitely of intrigue . Both Amazon and Google have proposed : app , cloud , movie , music , search , spot , store and talk as potential suffixes . When it comes to other tech giants , most have registered their names and not much else . Those who registered include : Samsung , Sony , Toshiba , Sharp , Panasonic , Acer , Apple . Microsoft , Yahoo , Flickr and Canon . AOL proposed both AOL and patch , while LG looks to have not bothered with the whole thing . One person who is trying to match both Amazon and Google for proposals is internet investor Frank Taylor Schilling . He is betting big in the land grab and has proposed the following : audio , cars , click , country , design , diet , family , fashion , flowers , free , furniture , garden gratis , photo , pics , pizza , property , real estate , restaurant , school , shopping , style and yoga . The proposals now go through a 60-day cooling off period where the public can sift through them and say if all is okay with the potential suffixes . Then it is up to ICANN to decide who is worthy of owning each domain name - which should be very interesting . Check the list out for yourself here .

Better late than never , Amazon finally released an iOS client for its Cloud Player service , allowing iPhone 4S and iPod touch owners to both stream and download their content from the cloud . Amazon Cloud Player marks a departure from the company 's HTML5 mobile-enhanced web app , which allows playing music tracks without DRM copy protection directly from the e-tailer 's cloud storage locker . The free Cloud Player app for iPhones and iPod touch allows both streaming and downloading of stored content , with the ability to both create and manage playlists that are also stored in the cloud . `` Customers tell us that they want access to all of their music , wherever they are , and on all of the devices they use , '' said Steve Boom , Vice President of Digital Music for Amazon . `` By bringing Cloud Player to iPhone and iPod touch , we now have the most widely compatible cloud playback solution available , giving our customers the ability to buy once and enjoy their music everywhere . '' Amazon Cloud Player includes 5GB of free storage , which customers can use to upload their own DRM-free MP3 or AAC music files . Purchases made through Amazon 's MP3 store can optionally be stored free of charge in Cloud Player , with the added benefit that such files wo n't consume available space . The Amazon Cloud Player app , now available for download from the App Store , also works just fine on the iPad , but since it 's not a universal app , there is no native support for the larger screen .

Google , eBay , Amazon and Facebook have banded together to form `` The Internet Association '' in an effort to make their voices heard in the halls of Washington . The Internet Association states its objective as `` advancing public policy solutions to strengthen and protect an open , innovative and free internet '' . The group will be led by Michael Beckerman , former deputy staff director of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . In a statement , Beckerman said : `` ... the Internet 's decentralized and open model is what has enabled its unprecedented growth and innovation . We must guard against misguided attempts to handcuff this incredible source of job creation , freedom and creativity . '' It wo n't just be the giants of the industry involved , and with the group 's official launch in September will come a full list of sponsors and members . The group has been formed in order to tackle a number of issues that will have a direct effect upon their businesses including online sales tax and piracy and anti-piracy bills such as SOPA . Net neutrality laws are another high-profile issue that is likely to be high on the group 's agenda .

Amazon is planning to expand further into the tablet market than ever before , introducing `` five or six '' new tablets , including a 10-inch model , according to Staples President of U.S. Retail Demos Parneros . Staples sells Amazon 's Kindle Fire . Parneros told a news service that the new Amazon tablets will come in a variety of different sizes , though he provided no hints on a possible release window . Another source , Glu Mobile Chief Executive Noccolo de Masi , said , `` They are trying to build on the foundations they have . '' Glu Mobile develops games for the Kindle Fire , and de Masi said he 'll support `` all new devices that have promise . '' Amazon 's 7-inch Kindle Fire tablet launched late last year and has become popular as a versatile media consumption device . Previous rumors have claimed that Amazon plans to expand the Kindle Fire line , with two new Kindle Fire 2 tablets possibly in the works , including the long-rumored 10-inch model . That report , along with one claiming that a new 7-inch Kindle Fire 2 is nearing release , claimed that Amazon 's new tablets will arrive by the end of the summer . But that time frame is quickly approaching and Amazon has yet to confirm or refute the Kindle Fire rumors . However , this is the first report to claim that Amazon plans to expand beyond the Kindle Fire line ( at least in the tablet market - other sources claimed earlier this month that Foxconn is helping to produce the first Amazon Phone ) . Amazon continues to remain tight-lipped , though . Reuters adds to the fire by suggesting that Amazon 's innovative Lab 126 has been hiring for work on new mobile devices that 'll run on familiar wireless carrier networks . According to multiple sources , it seems Amazon is thinking big on its next generation of mobile projects , whatever they prove to be in the end . Via Reuters
Amazon will open a new digital media development centre in London to work on key digital projects for the global business . The project will bring teams from Lovefilm and Pushbutton together to work on interactive digital services for a range of modern connected devices including televisions , tablets and phones as well as websites and the development of APIs . The office will be based in Glasshouse Yard near Barbican tube , and the move has been welcomed by Mayor of London Boris Johnson . `` I am thrilled to welcome Amazon 's fantastic new international digital centre to London , '' said Johnson . `` For this wildly successful and dynamic company to choose our city to site such an important facility is a splendid feather in our cap . `` We know we have the talent , the space and infrastructure to make the most of the digital economy - this will be my prime message during Games-time , as I seek to woo even more companies for the capital , delivering jobs and growth for Londoners . `` Amazon 's investment propels us well up the league table of global tech cities and we thank them for their vote of confidence . '' Amazon believes that London is the perfect place for its digital innovation , and the internet giant will represent a key arrival as England 's capital continues to reinvent itself as a digital and technological hub . `` London is a hotbed of tech talent and testament to that fact is Amazon choosing the capital as the location for the new global Digital Media Development Centre , '' said Paula Byrne , Managing Director of the Centre in London . `` Innovation is part of the Amazon DNA and we are creating a British centre of excellence to design and develop the next generation of TV and film services for a wide range of digital devices .

Amazon and Warner Bros. today announced an exclusive deal that will see cancelled Warner Bros. shows like Fringe and The West Wing make the jump to Amazon Prime Instant Video before competitors like Netflix get them . Other cancelled shows to soon appear on Amazon Prime Instant include Dark Blue , Alcatraz , and The Whole Truth . But Fringe and The West Wing will be available on Amazon Prime exclusively `` for the summer , '' after which time the shows will presumably make the jump to Netflix and other competitors . TechRadar has reached out to Netflix to find out whether these shows will be coming to the service , but they 've yet to respond . Amazon 's partnership with Warner Bros. is a clear bid to further erode Netflix 's place at the top of the streaming video market . But Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter finds it unlikely that Netflix will be toppled any time soon , he told TechRadar via email . `` Toppled is a bit of an overstatement , '' Pachter wrote . `` The exclusives signal that Amazon intends to compete , and ultimately suggests that Netflix 's subscriber growth will slow , '' he added . TechRadar reported earlier this year that Netflix is n't getting any new content any time soon . Nevertheless , Netflix reported earlier this year that the company 's UK and Ireland launch went off successfully , and the much-hyped return of Arrested Development will take place on the service next year . Netflix has debuted other original content as well . On the other hand , Amazon 's successful media-centric Kindle Fire tablet has helped boost its Amazon Prime Instant Video service , not to mention a successful launch on Microsoft 's Xbox 360 . And Amazon has continued to add content to the Prime Instant Video service since launching in February last year . The service may not be set to take the streaming video throne just yet , but it 's surely carving out its own niche . via Engadget

Amazon has graced Kindle Fire owners with a new social gaming platform called GameCircle , which is similar to Apple 's Game Center . The service will allow users to compete with other gamers on global leaderboards , unlock achievements and collect badges , just like with Apple 's offering for the iPhone , iPad and iPod touch . Interestingly though , Kindle Fire owners can use the Sync feature to auto-save progress on the cloud , which can be picked up even after games have been deleted and reinstalled on the Kindle Fire . The first supported title is the Indiana Jones-inspired Temple Run , which charges gamers with the endless task of escaping from man-eating-zombie-monkeys , while avoiding cliffs and fiery obstacles . Other developers can jump on board now by picking up the API . Amazon says Game Circle is easy to integrate within existing titles and more are on the way . Beyond the obvious , the cloud saving feature offers an interesting hint at Amazon 's future plans . The video below mentions the ability to pick up game progress on different device . Currently , there 's only one Kindle Fire device so does that mean there 's more on the way ? Speculation that Amazon is planning to launch a Kindle smartphone before the end of the year has resurfaced in the last week or so , so the cloud save feature may come in handy there . Via : Joystiq
A second Windows Phone executive has joined Amazon , adding yet more fuel to the Amazon Phone fire . Robert Williams was previously senior director of Windows Phone business development , but he 's just updated his LinkedIn profile to show that he 's now at Amazon as `` Director App Store '' . Williams ' ship jumping comes hot on the heels of Brandon Watson 's decision to leave his role at Windows Phone to join Amazon as director of Kindle cross platform . Neither of these appointments spells out Amazon Phone exactly ; after all , just because you 've worked on one phone platform does n't mean you 're destined only to work on phone platforms for the rest of your life . But they come at a time when we 're all getting a little het up about the possibility of an Amazon Phone and make us think that the retail giant just might have a phone in the works . The latest from the rumour mill is that Amazon is currently testing some smartphone prototypes , with an idea to start selling them by the end of this year . We 're expecting a 4- to 5-inch screen and Kindle-Fire-esque skinned Android operating system , should the phone ever come to fruition . As usual , Amazon 's not saying anything on the subject – but we 're more convinced that a Kindle Fire 2 is coming soon than we are of an imminent Amazon Phone launch .

Online retail giant Amazon is in talks with Google as it considers whether or not to stock the Nexus 7 tablet . Amazon redefined the budget end of the tablet market when it launched its Kindle Fire device last year , with a 7-inch display and rock bottom price tag of $ 199 . The Kindle Fire limited in its reach , with Amazon only offering it to the US market and Google has taken advantage of that , offering its Nexus 7 tablet to a worldwide audience . There 's no doubt that the Nexus 7 is the Kindle Fire 's biggest rival , and it 's come as no surprise that Google 's tablet is n't currently available on the retail giant 's website . An Amazon spokesperson told TechRadar : `` People higher up in Amazon are talking to Google regarding the Nexus 7 . '' There 's rumours that Amazon is prepping its next tablet , the Kindle Fire 2 , and it 's unlikely it would want to detract sales of its own-brand product by stocking the Nexus 7 . Apple are also rumoured to be creating a budget focused tablet , with the iPad Mini on the cards for a possible Autumn release – so Amazon needs to be on its game .
It 's been a bit quiet on the Amazon phone front recently , but fresh reports say the online retailer could start mass producing handsets within the next six months . According to the Wall Street Journal , sources from Amazon 's component suppliers have revealed that the firm is currently testing smartphones . Apparently Amazon is planning on mass producing a mobile phone towards the end of this year , or at the start of 2013 . The sources go on to say that Amazon is considering a handset which sports a screen somewhere between 4- and 5-inches , which would put it up against the likes of the HTC One X , Samsung Galaxy S3 and LG Optimus 4X HD . Amazon already has a handful of own-brand mobile devices in the form of the Kindle ereaders and Kindle Fire tablet , and a phone would see it broaden its reach in the market . With Amazon 's pedigree in affordable devices , we 'd expect its smartphone to carry an attractive price tag – potentially undercutting the competition by some margin . There 's been no official word from Amazon on the potential of creating its own phone , and the unnamed sources mean we ca n't take this latest report as the gospel truth – so it looks we 'll have to wait and see .

Devs in the know have let slip that the Amazon Kindle Fire 2 will feature a much-improved screen with a slightly different shape . The better display will feature a 1280 x 800 pixel resolution – a significant step up from the current 1024 x 600 pixel affair , as well as a new aspect ratio that will change the screen shape very slightly . The screen details come from All Things D which had it from developers who Amazon briefed on the upgraded tablet so they can ready their apps for the second generation . As well as the improved display , the Kindle Fire 2 will apparently come rocking a built-in camera and be thinner and lighter than its older sibling . Amazon is said to be releasing the second generation of the tablet for launch in Q3 2012 ( July-Sept ) although the smart money is on an August release . The first Kindle Fire never made it out of the US but the second iteration is expected to go global and take on increasing competition from the Google Nexus 7 and the much-rumoured iPad Mini .

Reports late on Thursday once again claimed that Amazon is currently developing a smartphone in the hope of replicating the success of its Kindle Fire tablet . Those notorious 'people with knowledge of the matter ' told Bloomberg that Amazon is working with long-time Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn on the device . Another unnamed source said that the online retailer is currently sweeping up wireless patents to ensure any device would be as immune as possible from the current spate of infringement lawsuits . However , aside from those two tidbits on the 'private ' plans , the Bloomberg report does n't give too much away . An Amazon-branded smartphone has been rumoured for a while now , with reports last year claiming Foxconn and Amazon already had a device in the works . At the time , analysts claimed the device would have a Kindle Fire-esque low price point and go on sale in Q4 2012 . Predictably , Amazon has declined to comment on this latest story , but the renewal of speculation adds further fuel to the flames . If Amazon did follow-up the Kindle Fire with a smartphone of its own , it would almost certainly run the Android operating system , given that Amazon already boasts its own Android App Store . The company would also hope customers would gobble-up Kindle books and subscribe to the Amazon Prime Video service in order to account for the low ( if any ) profit margins on the device .

The much rumoured Amazon Kindle Fire 2 may be with us in time for our summer holidays if the latest reports are to be believed . According to China Times , the first batch of tablets , estimated at 2 million units , could start shipping on August 7 . The report goes on to confirm that the Kindle Fire 2 will pack a 7-inch display and will be priced at the same level as the current Kindle Fire , $ 199 ( converted this around £130 ) . Amazon needs to move quickly , as the Google Nexus 7 is about to steal the budget tablet limelight with its quad-core processor , 1280x800 screen and price-matching cost of $ 199 ( exact UK pricing was £159 ) . The Nexus 7 will be available from mid-July , giving it the upper hand in the low-cost tablet battle and we hope Amazon can produce a slate which will give Google some decent competition . We 've also heard rumours about bigger Kindle Fire tablets and the report goes on to say that 8.9-inch and 10-inch models are still being considered , but it 's the 7-inch version which is getting priority at this time . You can keep up to date with the goings on with our Amazon Kindle Fire 2 release date , news and rumours article . From China Times via PocketNow

Apple is still showing three to four week ship times for the new MacBook Pro 2012 , but why pay full price when there are deals to be had online ? Best Buy and Amazon are both offering deals on Apple 's new high-resolution MacBook Pro with Retina Display , and buyers can save up to $ 139 by avoiding the Apple Store . The price war began with Best Buy , who is currently offering $ 110 off a new base model MacBook Pro with Retina Display with 256GB flash storage , on sale for $ 2,089.99 . There 's just one catch : The notebook is only being offered for in-store pickup , so if your local brick and mortar is out of stock , you may have a bit of a drive ahead of you to get to the next nearest store . Your next best bet is Amazon.com , where the same model gets a meager $ 5 price cut - but free Amazon Prime shipping ( for members only ) and no sales tax in most states could save potentially save buyers even more . If you 're looking to go with the faster 2.6GHz processor and double the storage to 512GB , Amazon is an even better deal at $ 2,659.99 , a full $ 139 less than Apple 's retail price , also with Prime shipping . Unfortunately , you 're in for a wait at Amazon as well : The e-tailer is currently showing ship dates `` within two to four weeks . '' But hey , good things come to those who wait… right ?

As expected , more rumors are popping up as the day of Amazon ’ s ambiguous press conference draws nearer . After a supposed photo of a Kindle Fire 2 emerged Thursday , a source revealed Friday that the company plans to launch two new 7-inch Kindle Fires during the September 6 event . Speculation has existed for quite some time a 7-and 10-inch device were next up for Amazon , but the source , talking with CNET , said the company will instead release an all new Kindle Fire ( perhaps the Kindle Fire 2 ) as well as a somewhat refreshed version of the current iteration . It looks like Amazon has cold feet about directly taking on one of its major competitors - Apple and its iPad - during a time the Cupertino company is expected to launch a 7.85-inch iPad Mini . Google 's 7-inch Nexus 7 is also a strong contender in the tiny tablet market , making it difficult for Amazon to make big moves without risking falling flat . According to the source , the all new Kindle Fire will feature more hardware improvements - like a faster processor - plus a camera , physical volume controls and an HDMI port . It will also reportedly have larger storage though it won ’ t be expandable . The upgraded Kindle Fire won ’ t feature many changes , though the source said it will have a new user interface . No pricing information was available nor could the source say whether the devices will be called the same name . It ’ s important to note that Amazon may have a larger device in the works , but , according to this source , who reportedly saw the devices in person , such a product won ’ t be unveiled next week . Amazon announced Thursday it had sold out of Kindle Fires , exactly one week before its big Santa Monica , Calif. press event . Leaks of a new `` Paperwhite '' display on the Kindle Touch also emerged the same day . Whatever Amazon is planning for next Thursday , TechRadar will be there to let you know the latest , though perhaps not largest , news coming from the company . Via CNET
A new report from Reuters claims that Amazon is planning mapping tech for the next Kindle Fire tablet , likely the Kindle Fire 2 . But despite the Kindle Fire tablets running on a version of Google 's Android OS , Amazon decided to go with Nokia 's maps instead of Google 's , claims Reuters . Amazon 's Kindle Fire runs on a stripped-down version of Android that does away with all of Google 's apps , and the companies would have to make a separate deal to bring Google Maps to the Kindle Fire 2 . Instead , it seems Amazon 's going with Nokia 's mapping until it can get an in-house solution going . And make no mistake : Amazon almost certainly does have an internal mapping solution in the works . The online retailer purchased 3D mappers UpNext in July , and you can bet they 're not just going to sit on that technology . The only question remaining is how long until the partnership with Nokia dries up , because that 's when we 're likely to see Amazon Maps take off . The Kindle Fire 2 could launch as soon as next week , if reports are to be believed . Amazon has a press conference scheduled for Thursday , and TechRadar will be in attendance to report all the Kindle Fire 2 news . The Kindle Fire 2 is expected to launch at the same $ 199 price point as the current Kindle Fire . Other rumors hint at a bigger screen , with some sources predicting a display as large as 10.1 inches . No matter what form the Kindle Fire 2 eventually takes , all will likely be revealed on Sept. 6 . Via The Next Web Mobile
As Amazon 's press event draws nearer , so do the news , leaks and rumors grow more frequent . Not only did Amazon announce the Kindle Fire had sold out Thursday , leaked photos reportedly of the Kindle Fire 2 made their way online to prying eyes . As of Thursday evening , the last Amazonian news to hit the internet were photos of a new E Ink Kindle with backlit display . The device looks to be a Kindle Touch , the company 's touchscreen e-reader , though with an updated design , look and new technologies on board . The leaked images show a bottom button-less device , one that 's almost black instead of granite . If the photos are authentic , then the most noticeable change is an improved display , one Amazon appears to refer to as `` Paperwhite . '' The backlit device is purportedly `` higher contract , high resolution '' with integrated lighting . It supposedly has up to eight weeks of battery life as well , no matter if the light is used or not . Rival Barnes & Noble and that company 's Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight already features the light-from-behind technology , so Amazon is a little late the game . However , with a big to-do going on next week , Amazon might just have a trick or two up its sleeves yet . Via The Verge

Amazon has filed a patent for a unique dual-sided tablet featuring two screens . Why would you want a screen on each side ? Interestingly , the second screen should improve the tablet 's battery life . Each screen in the proposed patent would serve a different purpose . One screen , an e-ink display , would serve static content like text-heavy documents and e-books . The opposite screen would be a full color LCD or OLED display , best used for videos , games , magazines , and web browsing . By including both screens on the same tablet , it could switch between the two in order to conserve energy running apps and documents when only the e-ink display is needed . The patent also suggests deeper integration of the dual-screen format . In one example , both screens are touch capable , allowing users to drag and move content between the two displays . It also details a method to use the tablet 's built-in cameras to detect which side is facing the user so that it will automatically switch which screen is being used . While Amazon is looking far into the future with its patents , a recently leaked image gives a closer look at what is allegedly the Kindle Fire 2 . We may get confirmation on that image soon too , with conjecture pointing to an Amazon unveil of a a 7- and 10- inch tablet at a Sept. 6 press conference outside Los Angeles . TechRadar is attending the Sept. 6 event , so we 'll have all the latest Amazon and Kindle news as soon as it 's available . Via Mashable
Someone skipped to the last page and leaked an image purporting to show the new Amazon Kindle Fire 2 Thursday . The image depicts an all black device with a scaled down keyboard , a sign this could be the 7-inch Fire we 've been hearing about . Amazon announced earlier in the day that its Kindle Fire 's sold out , leading many to speculate they 're prepping for an all out new tablet blitz . Rumors are also flying Amazon will announce at least one if not two devices at a September 6 press conference outside Los Angeles : a 7- and 10- inch tablet . The photo , sent to The Verge , is just of the device 's front , so there 's no indication of a rear-mounted camera . The device also appears to be a custom design , unlike the first Fire which paid homage to RIM 's BlackBerry PlayBook . Not much else can be gleaned from the image , though another was reportedly sent to the site under instructions not to publish . That photo purportedly has a streamlined user interface with less `` chrome '' and would fall in line with reports that Amazon is indeed planning to release two tablets . Whether either design as is makes it to production remains to be seen but if Amazon sticks with the little black book design , the devices should be simple indeed . TechRadar has reached out to Amazon and will update this story if and when information from them becomes available . We 'll also be at Amazon 's September 6 event , so stay tuned for all the latest coming out of the conference . Via The Verge
Amazon has announced that the Kindle Fire tablet is now 'sold out ' , adding that it has 'an exciting roadmap ahead ' . Given the bragging that 's going on in the announcement , we 'll give you one guess what the company has up its sleeve for its September 6 event . The company claims that the first Kindle Fire managed to 'capture ' 22 per cent of US tablet sales in the nine months since its launch , adding that it was `` the most successful product launch in the history of Amazon.com '' . So it 's clear that Amazon is n't retiring from the tablet game , as further evidenced by CEO Jeff Bezos ' comment that `` we have an exciting roadmap ahead '' . That leaves only one logical option : Kindle Fire 2 . `` We 're grateful to the millions of customers who have made Kindle Fire the most successful product launch in the history of Amazon , '' said Jeff Bezos , Amazon founder and CEO . `` This has been a big year for digital products on Amazon—all of the top 10 sellers on Amazon.com since Kindle Fire launched just less than a year ago are digital products . `` Kindle Fire is sold out , but we have an exciting roadmap ahead—we will continue to offer our customers the best hardware , the best prices , the best customer service , the best cross-platform interoperability , and the best content ecosystem . ''
Amazon ’ s Kindle reached a momentous milestone Tuesday as it surpassed the 100 million mark for exclusive titles purchased , downloaded and borrowed , according to the Wall Street Journal . With a catalogue of over 180,000 titles , Kindle-only books like War Brides by Helen Bryan - a World War II-era novel - and several by Karen McQuestion - A Scattered Life , Easily Amused , and The Long Way Home - have been bought and borrowed over 770,000 times . Amazon ’ s Prime members can borrow many of these digital pages for free as often as once a month with no due date , though they pay a fee for the privilege . Thousands picked up E.L. James ’ 50 Shades of Grey , boosting Kindle rental and purchasing numbers along with tales like Debora Geary ’ s A Modern Witch and Our Husband by Stephanie Bond . Although the Kindle faces fierce competition from other tablets like Apple ’ s iPad , a tablet that commands 70 percent of the market , signs point to a sea change coming for the company during a September 6 event . Though the company has offered few details besides a date and location , our best guess is the Amazon will announce the Kindle Fire 2 and other iterations of the popular e-readers then . By other iterations we think we could see at least a new 7-inch tab and perhaps even a larger 10-inch device debuted at the Santa Monica , Calif. event . If so , Amazon may enjoy many more rented and purchased titles . Via The Wall Street Journal

Amazon has finally brought access to its Cloud Drive for UK users . The cloud storage locker was launched in the US over a year ago but , as usual with Amazon , it has taken a while to ship it across the Atlantic . Users will get 5GB of free storage , while a subscription to 20GB of data is £6 a year . Storage guzzlers can get 1TB a year for £320 . The company has also rolled-out the Cloud Drive app for Mac and PC , which 'll allow users to control files from their desktop . Media files will be available online using the Cloud Player . The solution arrives on UK soil to tackle the likes of Apple 's iCloud , Google Drive , Dropbox and Microsoft 's SkyDrive . With free storage available through all platforms , there 's plenty of options available . The timing of the launch may be linked to the mystery Amazon event announced for September 9 . Rumours are abound that Amazon will launch a sequel to the Kindle Fire . Could this mean Amazon will finally launch a version of its tablet on UK soil ? Via : The Verge

Amazon is set to expand its social gaming division , hiring even more developers to work on its latest venture . With Sony announcing the sad demise of one of its most well-known studios , Studio Liverpool , this week it 's nice to see some expansion in the games arena – even if it is for fair-weather social gaming . Amazon has already announced its first social game , Living Classics which is out now on Facebook , but its hiring of fresh blood shows that Amazon has bigger things in mind that just one game . The social-gaming sector is one that 's in a state of flux . PopCap , owned by EA , is shedding 12 per cent of its employees in the US , while Zynga is losing executives in a bid to make more money and business analysts are calling for the company to look for a buyer . Amazon is expanding in this area , though , and is looking for employees in San Francisco – an interesting move as its headquarters are in Seattle , but an obvious one . The new job listings point to a mixture of social and casual gaming on the cards , so it seems Amazon will set its sights beyond Facebook , possibly into Google Play , the Apple App Store and its very own shop . We are expecting some more news on this in Amazon 's tight-lipped announcement this September , where it is hopefully set to unveil the Kindle Fire 2 . If you fancy working for Amazon Game Studios , then check out the company 's dedicated jobs page . We 've got a feeling Amazon is going to have to sift through a mountain of CVs . From TNW

In a cryptic note sent to members of the media , Amazon extended its hospitality to an airport hangar in Santa Monica , Calif. on Sept. 6 where it may or may not unveil the Kindle Fire 2 . The text on the invitation is scant : `` Please join us for an Amazon Press Conference . '' The just-outside Los Angeles soiree could be for any number of things , but industry insiders anticipate a big announcement to echo through the hangar 's halls . Though Amazon is cheekily keeping the details under wraps , the most obvious assumption would be the unveiling of a new generation of Kindle Fire tablets . TechRadar reported back in June that Amazon teased a new 7-inch and an unheard of 10-inch Kindle Fire 2 model , with a source reporting both could see the light of day sometime this summer . The 10-inch tab is reportedly set to run a more powerful , `` more competent '' quad-core processor while both large-display devices are said to be made of higher-quality materials and sport more ergonomic designs . More 's been reported on the 10-incher than 7-inch , and it will reportedly come with a front-facing camera , microUSB ports and HDMI-out jacks . However , the 7-inch tablet could come with a 1200 x 800 resolution screen and both tabs are supposedly slimmer and more akin to the first-gen Apple iPad than current Kindle Fire iterations . TechRadar also published a report that the 7-inch tablet could cost $ 199 , though we did n't have luck tracking down a 10-inch price . While our theories are only conjecture at this point and we really wo n't know anything for sure until Sept. 6 , we would n't put it past Amazon to pull the wool over everyone 's eyes and deliver something completely out of left field . TechRadar did some investigating last week and discovered that a shell company for Amazon filed papers with the Federal Communications Commission that supposedly outlined a new Kindle Fire 2 . We discovered the filings were made by a group called Harpers LLC , a front created by CSC Entity Services . CSC is a legitimate business that Amazon hired for these exact purposes . The filings were reportedly for a large screened , tablet device and quite possible for the next Kindle Fire 2 . Until we know exactly what Amazon 's got planned for the first Thursday in September , check out TechRadar 's Kindle Fire 2 rumors and news round up . Via All Things D and BGR

A new Kindle has shown up at the FCC suggesting that Amazon may have a regular Kindle ready to rock alongside the oft-rumoured Kindle Fire 2 . The device was registered by an anonymous company called Hannaford LLC , which the detectives over at The Digital Reader traced back to Corporation Service Company , known to be a front used by Amazon . Going by the product code `` EY21 '' , the new Kindle comes with both Wi-Fi and 3G and will be rectangular – that 's about all that can be gleaned from the application documents . The device documents were apparently submitted in October 2011 and tested on March 2012 , while `` Hannaford '' requested that the operational descriptions and more detailed schematics be kept secret on a permanent basis . There 's also a short term confidentiality agreement of pictures and the user manual be kept quiet for 180 days from the application date ( six months ) . That does n't really give us a clue as to a release date because Amazon could reveal the new Kindle ahead of time – but it does tell us that there will be a new Amazon Kindle by February , so that 's something . Under 'product description ' , the documents state , `` Model EY21 is an ereader . The primary use of this device is to download the ebook and periodical offering from the content provider . Model EY21 does not support voice transmission '' and adds that `` the wireless operations are operator-independent '' . As well as the new Kindle documents , the company also seems to have trademarked the term 'Firedock ' which , presumably , will be a dock for the Kindle Fire . From The Digital Reader

Amazon 's data division Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) has launched a new cloud-based backup and archiving solution that it claims offers `` a secure , reliable and extremely low cost storage solution . '' The Amazon Glacier solution is designed for data that is infrequently accessed , yet still important to retain for future reference . Examples include digital media archives , long-term database backups , and data that must be retained for regulatory compliance . Data storage with Glacier can be had from as little as $ 0.011/Gb/month and there are no start-up costs with Glacier , no minimum or maximum storage limits , and users only pay for what they use . Amazon Web Services quotes an average annual durability of 99.999999999 % for each item stored , and the service automatically replicates all data across multiple facilities , with regular data integrity checks and automatic repairs if hardware failure or data corruption is discovered . Amazon Glacier is available now in Europe using AWS ' data centre in Ireland and is also available in four other Regions around the world ( US-East ( N. Virginia ) , US-West ( N. California ) , US-West ( Oregon ) , Asia Pacific ( Tokyo ) ) . While storage is cheap there are other additional charges for transferring data out of storage – there 's no charge to place data in to Glacier – and for data transfer requests . The first 1Gb is free but charges increase on a sliding scale , starting at $ 0.120 per Gb with data requests charged at $ 0.055 per 1,000 requests . `` Today , most businesses rely on expensive , brittle , and inflexible tape for their archiving solution , '' said Alyssa Henry , Vice President of AWS Storage Services . `` This approach requires expensive upfront payments , is difficult to operate and maintain , and leads to wasted capacity and money . Amazon Glacier changes the game for companies requiring archiving and backup solutions because you pay nothing upfront , pay a very low price for storage , are able to scale up and down whenever needed , and AWS handles all of the operational heavy lifting required to do data retention well .

The Kindle Fire has been a fairly big success for Amazon , but that has n't stopped rumors of a second , bigger tablet coming from the company from circulating . Though all talk about the Kindle Fire 2 has been circumstantial to this point , a recent discovery of some FCC paperwork may just have grounded the device in reality . According to The Digital Reader , documents for a new tablet were filed by Harpers LLC , and have been cleared by the FCC . After a bit of detective work , it 's been discovered Harpers LLC is a front created by CSC Entity Services , a legitimate company believed to be hired by Amazon to file the FCC paperwork so this new tablet could not be traced back to them . Amazon has played this game before , and filed FCC documents through these shell companies since the advent of the second Kindle . There are even reports indicating Amazon used three different front companies to hide the original Kindle Fire from prying eyes last year . A peek inside the paperwork reveals the new tablet will use a 4:3 aspect ratio like the iPad instead of the 16:9 ratio used by many other Android devices . Digital Reader also believes the filings point to the Kindle Fire 2 being a larger 9-10 '' tablet , but there are very few other details , as the documents available for perusal are a bit limited in their scope . While it 's still short of a confirmation of the Kindle Fire 2 's existence from Amazon , it appears the online shopping conglomerate is taking the next step in efforts to better compete with the rumored iPad Mini and Nexus 7 .

Apple and Amazon have made it impossible to reset your password over the phone , for the time being at least . This follows the hacking of Wired writer Mat Honan 's iCloud account , which saw his iPhone , iPad , and MacBook Air remote wiped within minutes . Hackers gained access to his account over the phone , exploiting a loophole in Apple 's Applecare and Amazon 's tech support . The hackers added a new credit card to Honan 's Amazon account - all they needed was Honan 's name , email address and billing address . Then they phoned back up , saying they could n't access the account , and were able to reset the password , thanks to the use of the new credit card . They phoned Apple next , impersonating Honan , and it all went from there . The hackers could n't answer Honan 's security questions , but that did n't prove to be much of a hurdle . Which is a little worrying , to say the least . An unnamed Apple employee told Wired the freeze on phone access is to buy Apple time to work out how to reform its security policy . Amazon is taking similar steps . `` We have investigated the reported exploit and can confirm that the exploit has been closed as of yesterday afternoon , '' an Amazon spokesperson told CNET . So now you ca n't make changes to your Amazon account over the phone either . Hopefully we 'll see tightened security controls from both companies soon . Considering how well-publicised this has been , we 're expecting a statement from Apple to that effect any day now . Via The Verge , CNET

Amazon has revealed its game-face to the world , with the launch of a new gaming studio and Facebook game . Amazon has kept the fact that it was getting into social gaming rather quiet - although job vacancies within the company for devs threatened to give the game away - but it has revealed its new gaming arm in a blog post – announcing both a new game and the arrival of its games studio . `` Amazon Game Studios is exactly what it sounds like : a new team at Amazon that 's focused on creating innovative , fun and well-crafted games , '' explained the post . `` Our first title , Living Classics , is debuting on Facebook today . '' Living Classics is free and does n't exactly smack of originality – it 's a moving object game set to a backdrop of classic children 's books – but the mere fact Amazon is muscling in on the rather lucrative social gaming market is interesting . Amazon 's reason for getting into gaming is rather woolly , though , explaining on its blog : `` Why is Amazon making social games , you ask ? Good question ! We know that many Amazon customers enjoy playing games – including free-to-play social games – and thanks to Amazon 's know-how , we believe we can deliver a great , accessible gaming experience that gamers and our customers can play any time . '' Considering the billions the likes of Zynga and Rovi are making from games , we 're guessing the potential to make lots of money is a major factor in this as well . Although Facebook is the first platform it is launching on , with the rise of its own app store and its lofty ambitions for the Kindle Fire , it wo n't be long before we see more Amazon titles hitting the market .

As students head back to school in the coming weeks , Amazon is looking to take some of the pain out of buying books with an all new textbook rental service . Amazon already offers rentals on certain digital textbooks through the Kindle , but that service got an upgrade Monday as students got the option to rent paperback and hardcover books from the site for a semester . Students can expect to save up to 70 percent on rental books , which are lent out for a full semester , or 130 days . Both new and used textbooks will be shipped based on availability , with all used books guaranteed in `` acceptable rental condition . '' Amazon plans to charge late books a 15-day extension fee and the full price of the book after that . Students should also note that additional charges can apply for `` excessive writing or highlighting '' in the rented texts . Amazon is no stranger to students and the books they need for classes and has been offering a textbook buyback program for several years . However , with many books depreciating in value as new editions are published , semester rentals are an increasingly attractive service for students . Half.com also offers a similar textbook rental service , with the added flexibility to rent for either 30 or 125 days at a time . Amazon 's own Kindle textbook rental service also offers more flexible scheduling , with the option to rent a book for between 30 and 360 days . This is only the first school year Amazon has offered physical textbook rentals , so the service will likely evolve in future terms . In the meantime , it will at least help save everyone from college-bound teens to super seniors to returning students from the price gauging at their campus bookstores .

Apple continues to beef up its streaming media options with the addition of Amazon Instant Video for iPad . Amazon launched the streaming Instant Video service in February 2011 , and since then it 's expanded to the Amazon Kindle Fire , the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 gaming consoles , Roku , Mac and Windows PCs , smart TVs and Blu-ray players , and now , Apple 's iPad . This announcement comes just a day after Apple covertly employed a new partnership with Hulu to bring the Hulu Plus stream to second- and third-generation Apple TV boxes . With Netflix and Hulu Plus already available on the iPad , Apple 's streaming video offerings are becoming quite robust . Amazon Instant 's expansion to non-Kindle devices comes with plenty of benefits for users . The iPad app offers several useful features , including a `` Your Watchlist '' function that allows users to queue up videos to watch or purchase later regardless of whether they own them . Like other Amazon Instant apps , the iPad version also uses `` Whispersync '' to remember playback positions across multiple devices . And naturally , iPad users will have access to their entire library of Amazon Instant Video purchases and subscriptions . Users with a $ 79 Amazon Prime membership can access a selection of more than 17,000 free streaming TV show episodes and movies , and an additional 100,000 or so are available for individual purchase . At the time of its launch in May , the Xbox 360 's Amazon Instant Video app did n't allow users to purchase individual titles from within , instead referring them to the service 's website . An Amazon spokesperson confirmed today that the iPad app similarly wo n't allow users to purchase video from with the app , though content purchased from a web browser is instantly added to users ' libraries . `` You could use Safari to scan the Instant Video library and then purchase the titles that you want to watch , and then once you purchase them , they 'll automatically go into the app , '' the spokesperson told TechRadar . `` You ca n't actually purchase via the app , '' the spokesperson emphasized , but `` there 's not a step in between purchasing and it getting to the app , so once you purchase , it 'll just automatically be there . '' There 's no word on whether Amazon plans to add that functionality , but even with this slightly annoying extra step , Amazon Instant is surely robust enough to offer a decent alternative to Netflix and Hulu Plus .
Amazon has finally managed to pin record labels down to deals that allow it to offer a scan and match track service like that of iTunes Match and Sony Music Unlimited . Sony Music , EMI , Universal , Warner and over 150 independent companies have all signed on the dotted line to allow Cloud Player customers to scan their hard drives and make all their music available to stream from the cloud , rather than having to arduously upload it all themselves . Amazon MP3 purchases will now be automatically saved to the cloud locker , and all scanned-and-matched music from iTunes or Windows Media Player will be made available at 256 Kbps , regardless of the quality of the file you own . There are also a couple of bits of new hardware on the horizon , with Amazon quietly adding that Sonos and Roku systems will soon be Cloud Player compatible . The wireless systems join iOS , Android and the Kindle Fire as Cloud Player friendly products – you can also access your library through any old web browser . Although you can sign up to Cloud Player for free , that will only give you 250-songs worth of storage ; paying an annual fee of $ 24.99 ( around £15 although it has n't officially launched in the UK ) will nab you 1,000 times that ( that 's 250,000 songs , maths-phobics ) . Hopefully the leaps forward in licensing deals will see an official Amazon Cloud Player launch hit the UK - maybe at the same time that the Kindle Fire finally lands on British shores , eh Amazon ?

Amazon has requested that Apple 's false advertising claim against it for use of the term 'Appstore ' be thrown out of court . Apple reckons Amazon calling its app , er , shop the Amazon Appstore is false advertising because silly little consumers like thee and me will think it 's somehow Apple-related . But in a filing this week , Amazon requested that the judge chuck the false advertising claim out because `` app store '' is a generic term , not just an Apple term . Amazon 's lawyers contended that , `` The word 'Appstore ' is part of the name of Amazon 's store ; it is not a statement about the nature , characteristics , or qualities of Amazon 's store , much less a false one . `` What Apple is actually contending is that the use of 'Appstore ' may confuse consumers into believing that the Amazon Appstore is related to or sponsored by Apple . `` Leaving for another day whether that is a reasonable contention , it is clearly one that sounds in trademark , not false advertising . '' That means Amazon thinks 'app store ' is now an everyday term for a marketplace where you exchange money for apps , and is n't thought by anyone to specifically refer to Apple 's App Store . Amazon even points out that Steve Jobs and Tim Cook have both used the phrase 'app store ' to describe Android 's app retailer , now known safely as Google Play . Apple has n't responded to the barbed request , but the courts will rule on Amazon 's motion at the end of October . You 'll be on tenterhooks until then , no doubt . From The Register

Something tells us that Reed Hastings is n't going to renew his Amazon Prime membership . The outspoken Netflix CEO described Amazon 's Instant Video service as a `` confusing mess . '' `` [ Amazon has its Prime membership service ] and it 's really about low-cost shipping , but why is video in there ? It 's kind of a confusing mess , '' Hastings told the Wall Street Journal . By comparison , Netflix solely focuses on video . Algorithms that inform users of what content they might enjoy are at the heart of why the company does a better job , according to Hastings . For this reason , he puts both Amazon and Hulu on the lower end of his favorite video services queue . Hastings also defended Netflix 's higher price in the same interview , and he did it with another knock on what Amazon has to offer . `` In the U.S. , our content budget is about three times [ Amazon 's ] , and we 've got about three times more content . And what our customers tell us is they want Netflix to have more content , not to have two-thirds less at a lower price . '' Netflix 's unlimited streaming plan is $ 7.99 a month , while Amazon charges $ 79 a year for Prime . That comes out to $ 6.53 a month and includes perks like free two-day shipping , $ 3.99 one-day shipping and a Kindle Owners ' Lending Library . The good news for current Netflix customers is that they should n't see a price increase or a tiered plan any time soon . `` Our fundamental view is we grow revenue by expanding the number of members , rather than increasing the pricing , '' Hastings told the WSJ . `` We want Netflix to be a very simple experience : one price , a clean proposition . '' Hastings also dismissed pay-per-view , ad-supported video like Hulu Plus and downloading and storing content . He called selling content to users `` too complicated . '' Instead , the Netflix CEO expects to win back customers by exclusively streaming season four of Arrested Development . The company has a total of five original programs scheduled for 2013 . Netflix 's stock price , down 79.86 percent since its peak last year , made a modest recovery today . It gained 2.47 percent at the close of the trading day . Via WSJ , CNET

Wal-Mart will cease selling Amazon products , including Kindles , the international retail chain announced Thursday . `` Recently , Wal-Mart Stores , Inc. made a business decision to not carry current Amazon products beyond our purchase commitments and existing inventory , '' a Wal-Mart spokeswoman told TechRadar . `` Our customers trust us to provide a broad assortment of products at everyday low prices , and we approach every merchandising decision through this lens . '' In an internal memo sent to store managers Wednesday , the store said the cessation of sales would affect Amazon tablets and eReaders , including `` all Amazon Kindle models current and recently announced . '' According to Wal-Mart , the decision is consistent with the company 's merchandising strategy . The company said it will continue to sell products that fall into the Kindle Fire category . `` We will continue to offer our customers a broad assortment of tablets , eReaders and accessories at a variety of great price points , '' the company spokeswoman said . `` This decision is consistent with our overall merchandising strategy . '' Wal-Mart dominates the brick-and-mortar retail space , Reuters , which first broke the story , reported . However , it trails online retailers - like Amazon - and faces competition as devices like Amazon 's Kindle Fire HD allow users to shop for other products , not just digital books . Currently , the company , which has a number of subsidiaries including Wal-Mart International and Sam 's Club , sells Apple 's iPad and the Nook by Barns & Noble . Target also recently decided to stop carrying the Kindles . The cessation will impact all Wal-Mart locations in the U.S. , online , and internationally , the spokeswoman said . TechRadar reached out to Amazon for comment and will update this story if and when we receive more information . From Reuters

When Amazon announced the new Kindle Fire HD earlier this month , it also snuck out a new mobile Amazon Maps API for developers . Now Amazon is drawing attention to its new mobile maps API to explain some of the features and benefits of using Amazon Maps to create apps . The Amazon Maps API allows developers to embed interactive maps directly into their apps , allowing users to pan , zoom , and move about at will . The in-app maps can pull from a user 's current location , and swap between satellite and standard map views . Developers can also put their own custom markers on the maps , allowing a business to place pins for all of its locations right in its own Android app . While the move lessens Amazon 's reliance on Google , the API is not based on any proprietary mapping service from the online retail giant . As previously reported , Amazon recently struck a deal with Nokia , who will provide map and geocoding data for Amazon 's tablets , and is the core of the Amazon Maps API . However , it was n't until Monday that Nokia confirmed it was indeed licensing its Location Platform to Amazon . `` Amazon is licensing the Nokia Location Platform ( NLP ) for maps and geocoding , '' said Sebastian Kurme , a spokesperson for Nokia 's Communications , Location & Commerce business units , in a message to The Next Web . Nokia is already providing maps for Windows Phone 8 , positioning the company as the mapping competitor to Google and Apple 's own services . With Nokia maps encroaching onto the Android-based Kindle Fire HD , the company is making strides toward a bigger piece of the mobile pie . That is , until Amazon develops its own in-house mapping and takes full ownership of Kindle navigation . From Amazon via Engadget , The Next Web
Want an Apple Lightning-to-30-pin adapter but do n't want to drop $ 29 ( £18 ) on one ? Starting Monday , you do n't have to . Amazon has put pre-orders for legacy device-enhancing adapters made by third parties on its site , offering them up for $ 9.99 ( about £6 ) and $ 17.95 ( about £11 ) . Two companies - Nanotch and iTronz - are schilling the products , with the latter , selling the $ 10 version , promising to ship it by next week . Apple 's adapters are `` available to ship '' in October . Thanks to an erroneous message , customers thought they 'd get a free adapter with the purchase of an iPhone 5 . However , Apple quickly pulled the message and reminded customers that they would indeed have to fork over some dough for the dock adapter . In other Apple/Amazon news , Amazon has begun taking pre-orders for Apple 's new iPod line - the reinvented iPod nano , iPod touch , and cheaper iPod shuffle . Apple wo n't start shipping the new iPods until October , so it 's unlikely Amazon will stray from the launch plan . There also appears to be no change on the price front , either . The iPod touch and iPod nano both need the slimmer Lightning cable to charge and connect . TechRadar reached out to Apple for comment on its policy towards third-party product manufacturers and will update this story if and when information is available .

Microsoft 's Bing will be the default search provider on the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD tablets . Bing will replace Google , which was the default provider on the original Kindle Fire . The discovery was made by the Ubergizmo site during a hands-on with the new 7-inch and 8.9-inch Android tablets . Microsoft told Business Insider : `` Bing will be the default search provider on the new Kindle Fire HD . No other details are available at this time . '' Cutting out Google search is a major slap in the face from Amazon . It uses the Google-built , open source Android OS , yet built its own appstore rather than use the Google Play Store .

Conflicting reports surfaced Friday as to whether the upgraded Kindle Fire and the three members of the all-new Kindle Fire HD family would have advertisement opt-out capabilities found in earlier Kindle Fires . An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to TechRadar that none of the new models will have ad opt-out options . `` No opt-out for Kindle Fire , '' the spokesperson said , later clarifying that to mean both the upgraded Kindle Fire and all Kindle Fire HDs . Instead , those who buy the revamped Kindle Fire , the 7- or 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD ( which also comes as an 8.9 inch with 4G LTE ) will have no reprieve from ad-supported `` Special Offers '' on their devices . These sponsored ads appear on the lock-screen as well as on the home screen . There is no plan to provide opt-outs for these devices in the future , the spokesperson added . In previous models , users had the option of either buying an ad-free version ( for an added cost ) or by buying out of ads once a Kindle was bought . However , as TechRadar learned , neither these nor any other opt out options are being offered . An Engadget reader provided a response to an inquiry about Special Offer opt-outs , written by an Amazon support person , to the site early Friday . The Amazon employee told the reader that : `` Options for unsubscribing special offer will be announced soon . '' CNET later contradicted that claim and , as TechRadar also learned , confirmed no opt-out options are included with the new devices . In other Kindle Fire ( and Kindle Fire 2 ) news , Best Buy has begun taking pre-orders for the tablets . Pre-orders from the world 's largest consumer electronics retailer started one day after Amazon announced the products and offered pre-orders through its own site . Amazon said that the devices will start shipping as early as Sept. 14 and as late as Nov. 20 , while in the U.K. and other parts of Europe should get devices in the mail beginning Oct. 25 . Joining Best Buy in carrying at least some Kindle Fires in the U.S. is Staples , the country 's top office supply chain store . Starting as early as the end of this month , Staples said it plans to shelve some of the bigger , faster and more aggressively priced Kindle Fires . Office Depot said the upgraded Kindle Fire , plus accessories , will be in its U.S. stores by late Sept. as well . Via Engadget , CNET , Reuters
Amazon unleashed a volley of new Kindle devices on Thursday and even though they have n't shipped yet , the company 's CEO promises there 's more to come . In an interview following the press event , Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos skirted rumors about the e-tailer releasing their own smartphone , but pledged more must-have devices remain in the pipeline . `` We will , certainly - not any time soon , but next year we have some more things that we hope people will enjoy , '' Bezos told AllThingsD . `` And it 's premature for me to talk about them . '' One such device everyone 's itching for is an Amazon smartphone , with some pundits even predicting Thursday was the day it would be revealed . Back in June , TechRadar consolidated all of the Kindle smartphone rumors into one tidy place and there are still plenty of reasons why Amazon may move in that direction . Meanwhile , this week 's press conference laid the groundwork for a new generation of Kindle devices , ranging from the Kindle Paperwhite at $ 119 all the way up to the 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD with 4G LTE at $ 499 . The addition of 4G LTE data , Bluetooth and HDMI output to the Kindle Fire HD seems like the most compelling evidence yet that the company could make the leap to a full-fledged smartphone . And while Amazon continues to fork Google 's Android for its Fire devices , the good news is the company is finally using Android 4.0 : Ice Cream Sandwich for this year 's models . Can some form of Android 4.1 : Jelly Bean be far behind ? Via AllThingsD
Has Amazon really ruined Christmas for Google ? It certainly looks that way : its new Kindle Fire HD is a tasty bit of kit that beats the Nexus 7 on several key areas , including the price . It 's not entirely a win for Amazon , though - so let 's find out which tablet wins on the stuff that really matters . The Kindle Fire HD goes on sale in the UK on the 25th of October , but you can pre-order from Amazon today . The Nexus 7 is out now and available from retailers and from Google 's own Play website . Both tablets come with two price tags , £159 and £199 , but on paper at least you get more for your money with Amazon : the £159 Nexus 7 has 8GB of storage compared to the Kindle Fire HD 's 16GB , and the £199 Nexus 7 has 16GB to the Kindle Fire HD 's 32GB . The Kindle Fire HD processor is a Texas Instruments OMAP4 4460 ( its bigger 8.9-inch brother has a 4470 , which has faster graphics ) , which is a dual-core model running at 1.2GHz . The Nexus 7 processor is a Tegra 3 , a quad-core rated at 1.3GHz . Both devices promise all-day battery life , with the Kindle Fire HD promising 11 hours of continuous use and the Nexus 7 nine . In our hands-on Kindle Fire HD review we found that the Kindle Fire HD was a little bit stuttery , which we hope is due to poorly optimised software rather than an underpowered processor . If it 's the former Amazon can fix it before the Kindle Fire HD ships . Amazon has n't specified how much memory the Kindle Fire HD has , but as its cheaper sibling the Kindle Fire 2 has 1GB , we 're betting on that . The Nexus 7 has 1GB too . Both devices run version 4 of Android - 4.1 in the Nexus and 4.0 in the Kindle Fire HD - although the version in Amazon 's tablet is a heavily customised one that keeps its origins well hidden . That customisation means Amazon can offer some interesting things , such as excellent parental controls that can limit not just what your little darlings can do , but also how long they do it for . Of course , having to deal with a proprietary version of Android is not necessarily a good thing , with Google 's vanilla version a little less prone to push you into a shop than Amazon 's . Plus , Android 4.1 is a big step on from 4.0 and , we 'd imagine , that Google will push future updates to its Nexus 7 fairly swiftly . Both tablets have seven-inch , 1280x800 HD displays with Gorilla Glass , but Amazon reckons it 's got the edge with its polarising filter and anti-glare technology . The former improves the IPS display 's viewing angles , while the latter promises to cut glare by around one-quarter . The Kindle Fire HD also has a Micro-HDMI connector for HD video output . Both tablets come in two flavours : the Nexus 7 in 8GB and 16GB versions and the Kindle Fire HD in 16GB and 32GB versions . Unlike many rivals you ca n't upgrade the internal storage with flash memory cards . Remember that the operating system needs some of that storage : for example Amazon says that the Kindle Fire HD gives you around 12.6GB on the 16GB model and 26.9GB on the 32GB . Both devices are also tightly integrated with their respective creators ' cloud-based media services . The Nexus 7 has a 1.2MP front-facing video camera for video chat , while the Kindle Fire has an `` HD '' front-facing camera for the same purpose . The Kindle Fire also has a pair of dual-driver stereo speakers with Dolby Digital Plus to deliver decent music playback and clearer video dialogue . The Nexus 7 has a plain old speaker . For the time being both devices are Wi-Fi only ( a 3G Nexus 7 is incoming ) , and the Kindle Fire has the edge : it has dual MIMO Wi-Fi antennas and operates in both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency bands . The Nexus 7 has a single antenna and only uses the increasingly crowded 2.4GHz frequency band , but it does have an NFC chip for device-to-device communication , and built-in GPS , accelerometer and magnetometer for location- and position-based apps The Nexus 7 is 198.5 x 120 x 10.45mm and weighs 340 grams , while the Kindle Fire HD is shorter and heavier at 193 x 137 x 10.3mm and 395g .
Amazon punched out a deluge of new devices today , including a family of Kindle Fire HDs . While we know there 's multiple models - a 7- , 8.9- and 8.9-inch 4G LTE version - and a bit about their software , we did n't know until now which operating system these bad boys are packing . According to a published report , an Amazon spokesperson confirmed that the devices are running Android 4.0 : Ice Cream Sandwich . While it 's not quite Jelly Bean - and there 's no word on an update - at least we know the high-def devices have a newer OS running the show . We do n't know what 's behind the Kindle Paperwhite -Amazon 's new bright display beauty - yet but it could have Android under hood , too . In 16GB , 32GB and 64GB ( for 4G LTE ) varieties , these devices promise to be a powerful kick to the Kindle line-up . We 've got some first hand reviews here , and with mildly competitive pricing , you can judge for yourself if these tabs are worth investing in . Via Engadget

It 's also helped by new processor , and a battery life that beats the original . The new Kindle Fire price is $ 159 . It 's available for pre-order now , and begins shipping on Sept. 14 . Ever wished your Kindle was self-illuminating and had a touchscreen ? Well Amazon has heard you , the Kindle Paperwhite has both those things , and comes in Wi-Fi or contract-free 3G . It 's extremely light and thin , weighing only 7.4 ounces with a thickness of just 9.1mm . The Kindle Paperwhite uses fiber optics for a front-lit screen that can be read in the dark . It offers 25 percent higher contrast and 62 percent more pixels than the standard Kindle . It also boasts a battery rate for a jaw-dropping eight weeks , and that 's with the screen illuminated . Lastly , the Paperwhite offers global 3G service that works in more than 100 countries , all with no contract . The Kindle Paperwhite price is $ 119 for Wi-Fi only and $ 179 for 3G .

These will be read by actors , and will allow users to go between text and voice seamlessly . Amazon 's presentation showed actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Anne Hathaway reading bestsellers . Whispersync , the feature that keeps your place in whatever you 're reading across Amazon devices , will now work with games and e-book Immersion Reading narration , on the Kindle Fire HD or a smartphone with the Audible app . You 'll be able to pick up right where you left off by reading text or by listening . For gaming , Whispersync on the Kindle Fire HD will now back up your progress , letting you continue at your last checkpoint , and keeping track of your scores and completed levels . This should help household negotiations . Parents will now be able to create individual profiles for their children , and limit what they can do on a Kindle Fire HD . Parents can set individual time limits for activities like reading , watching videos and playing games . It can all be tweaked , so you can rig the device for your children to have unlimited reading time , but only an hour or two of game time a day .
In case you somehow missed the news , Amazon announced a handful of new Kindle devices Thursday . A new model of the popular Kindle Fire tablet will soon be joined by three versions its successor , the Kindle Fire HD . Additionally , Amazon introduced a brand-new ereader , the Kindle Paperwhite . As impressive as all of these new and revamped devices are , Amazon has gone above and beyond when it comes to the new features and software included with their amped up Kindle line-up . When the revamped Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD arrive , they 'll be stocked with a bunch of Kindle-exclusive features . Chief among the upgrades all Fire devices will get is a massive upgrade to the X-Ray software . Previously introduced on the Kindle Touch , X-Ray will now be incorporated for movies , books , and textbooks . With a simple tap , users can find out about any actor in a given scene with help from IMDb , or search a glossary of a text without ever leaving the page they 're on . Not to be outdone , Whispersync fans will also find the reach of that feature boosted quite a bit . While you could already use Whispersync to keep your place in a book across multiple Kindle devices in the past , Amazon expanded the virtual bookmark to work with audiobooks and games as well . When reading , Whispersync for Voice allows you to leave off wherever you want , and pick up from the same point in the narrated version , or even read along with the audiobook . The gaming version of Whispersync works in a similar manner , allowing you to resume play from any device thanks to cloud saving . The Kindle Fire devices will see the benefits of all the Whispersync improvements , while the Kindle Paperwhite will utilize Whispersync for Voice . Add with that `` Immersion Reading , '' a partnership between Amazon and Audible to sync sight and sound while perusing narratives , and you have an all encompassing reading experience . The feature highlights text as its `` professionally read aloud . Parents can now screen content for their children , as well as setting time limits on how long they 'll be able to access the Kindle Fire tablets . Each and every feature on the Kindle Fire can be limited separately , which allows you to put a stop to endless hours of gaming , but also lets you set the reading abilities to unlimited . Multiple profiles can be set up for households with more than one child , and FreeTime wo n't allow kids to expand beyond the limitations you 've set without a password . Skype has teamed up with Amazon to create a customized version of their app for the Kindle Fire HD . With its front-facing camera , the Kindle Fire HD is ideal for on-the-go video messaging right out of the box . The service will of course remain free , which should come as no surprise to frequent Skype users , but as an added benefit for new users . Coming to the Kindle Paperwhite is a new built-in feature called Time to Read . Time to Read will let you know how long it will take you to finish a chapter or a book based on its measurements of your previous reading habits . The feature constantly updates alongside you , and will allow you to better estimate whether or not you have time to finish a chapter , or pick it back up later . The Kindle Paperwhite 's new display will not only be readable in all light , but it will also have hand-tuned fonts for even better reading . Amazon has worked on the fonts the device will use down to the pixel level , which should give readers an unprecedented amount of clarity no matter where or what they 're reading . All the hard work on fine-tuning fonts has also allowed Amazon to include fancier fonts such as Baskerville and Palatino , which were so fine and thin , they were previously often hard to read legibly on an ereader . The new HD family comes fully loaded with an upgraded email system , Microsoft Exchange . Amazon 's touting the fact the email service will sync newer emails before older ones , allowing for quicker access time . Email support is available for Gmail , Exchange , Hotmail and , Amazon says , more . There 's also an enhanced calendar app . Via Amazon
Amazon today announced spate of new Kindles in addition to an extension of its Kindle self-publishing program with Kindle Serials as part of a grand press event held in Santa Monica , Calif . Kindle Serials let authors publish books as installments , akin to classic serial novels from the time of Charles Dickens . Users will purchase the novels upfront to receive the first chapter , with new chapters added as free automatic updates as soon as the author publishes them . It 's not entirely clear if a delay will be implemented to simulate the serial novel experience for those who purchase a story after several installments are published . Users can also provide feedback to authors , which scribes may or may not appreciate to varying degrees . The program will launch on Kindle with eight titles , priced at $ 1.99 each . The initial serial novels will comprise a range of genres , including yoga mystery `` Downward-Facing Death '' and `` Hacker Mom . '' As an homage to one of the best known serial authors , Charles Dickens ' `` Oliver Twist '' and `` The Pickwick Papers '' will be republished for free through Kindle Serials in their original segments , complete with their original covers and illustrations . Authors can self-publish on Kindle Serials as an extension of Amazon 's Kindle Direct Publishing initiative . Amazon revealed that 27 of the top 100 books on Kindle are self-published through the KDP program . The program lets authors keep ownership of their book copyright , and offers a 70 percent royalty on copies sold through the Kindle store . Amazon billed Kindle Serials as a modern take on publishing during its press conference , but the concept is really more of a throwback to a bygone time in fiction . Either way , the return of serial novels is a welcome one that should open up new doors both for authors and readers looking for their next quick fictions fix . From Amazon via Yahoo
The Amazon Kindle Fire was n't left out of the new-product-happy-press event the online retailer hosted in the L.A. suburb of Santa Monica , Calif. Thursday . In addition to announcing the Kindle Fire HD - in 7-inch , 8.9-inch and 4G LTE flavors - and the Kindle Paperwhite , Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos let it be known the good old Kindle Fire is getting a boost , too . The tab will now feature a `` new faster processor , '' two times the RAM ( 1GB ) , 40 percent faster performance and longer battery life . That processor is specked at 1.5GHz , according to Amazon . The price also dropped to $ 159 , down from $ 199 . The U.K. ( plus some other European countries ) got its own Kindle Fire pricing Thursday . Although the look is still the same and there 's still no camera or Bluetooth , Amazon seems amped on the new features and new price . According to Bezos , the Kindle Fire comprises 22 percent of tablet sales in the U.S. Its popularity is what prompted his company to rethink and retool their go-to tablet . Though pre-ordering is open today , the device wo n't ship until Sept. 14 . We 'll have hands on reviews with the devices Amazon introduced today , but until then check out our Amazon Kindle Fire 2 hub page for all the latest coming out of Santa Monica .

Amazon launched a new ereader Thursday , the Kindle Paperwhite , featuring a new illuminated screen for Kindle action in the dark . The hallmark of this 6 inch , 7.5 ounce , 9.1mm thin device is its display , which Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos said has 25 percent more contrast with 212 pixels per inch and 62 percent more pixels . Using a patented fiber optic cable flattened out technology , the touch-based screen has eight weeks of battery life . `` [ It 's ] perfect in the bedroom , perfect in direct sunlight , '' Bezo said during the event . `` People are going to love this device , and they 're going to love the light . In fact , they 're going to love it so much they 're going to leave it on all the time . '' According to Bezos , even the fonts have been optimized for display . Using built-in front lighting , the Paperwhite is supposedly readable in all lighting conditions and with no eye strain because it sends light under an anti-glare layer towards the display , not up towards the reader . TechRadar will have a hands on review of the device soon and we 'll be sure to let you know how it performs in different lighting conditions . The Paperwhite also comes with a Time to Read feature , which tracks readers ' average reading speed and calculates how long they have until their battery runs out . Coming in both Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi+3G , the Wi-Fi 's at $ 119 while 3G costs $ 179 . Bezos said they can be ordered today and will ship October 1 . Amazon will pay for the 3G connection , the company said in a press release , meaning customers wo n't pay out-of-pocket for improved connectivity . That 8-week battery can last no matter how high the lights are turned up , Amazon claimed . Bezos also introduced a new price for the non-touch Kindle at $ 69 . The newly priced device - with new fonts , crisper text and 15 percent faster page turns - starts shipping today . Via CNET , The Verge , Amazon
Amazon 's off to a good start ahead of its 10:30 a.m. PST press event in Santa Monica , Calif , thanks to its Appstore for Android reaching more than 50,000 apps . The figure is actually 50,505 , with 31,250 of those Kindle Fire compatible . It took just 18 months for the store to reach the milestone . This second number is particularly significant as the company readies to launch what most expect will be two new tablets Thursday : likely a 10-inch Kindle Fire and a new Kindle ereader , possibly the Paperwhite Kindle we saw leaked last week . Amazon aired an advertisement during Wednesday night 's first regular season NFL game that seemed to hint at a new larger Kindle Fire ( possible the Kindle Fire 2 ) and a backlit , higher contrast , higher resolution ereader . While we wo n't know just what 's going to come out of the airplane hangar Amazon is hosting its event in for a little while longer , we can only imagine they 're getting ready to take on tablet titan Apple ( expected to launch an iPad Mini next month ) as well as Google ( Nexus 7 ) , Barnes & Noble ( Nook Tablet ) and Samsung . Samsung recently unveiled its Galaxy Note II and while they do n't bill it as a tab , it fits certain slate criteria , particularly in size . TechRadar is live at the Amazon event and will have all the latest , hands on reviews and more coming out of Los Angeles . Via Amazon Appstore for Android , The Verge
Amazon is all set to launch a number of new products today – and it may have already leaked what it 's going to show . An advert was aired in the US during the Dallas Cowboys V New York Giants game which revealed 'something new ' . That something new looks to be a 10-inch model of the Kindle Fire ( Kindle Fire 2 perhaps ? ) and another Kindle , which looks suspiciously like the Paperwhite Kindle that was leaked earlier in the week . If Amazon is indeed releasing a larger Kindle Fire , then it will be putting the tablet up against the new iPad . And the only way it will actually compete against this 800lb gorilla in the room is by making the price desirable . Considering the Kindle Fire 's price was lower than most tablets on the market at the time , however , and the company has a subsidised strategy with its Kindle ereader range , it 's a fair bet that we will see a tablet with an enticing price . Although Amazon is launching its latest products in Los Angeles , this does n't mean the UK will miss out . The arrival of the Amazon Appstore in the UK could well point to the Kindle Fire coming to Britain soon . TechRadar will be reporting from the event , so be sure to keep checking the site . If you want to check the advert out for yourself , then you are in luck as someone happened to film their TV while it was showing . It 's like one of those found footage movies but unfortunately without a monster coming to destroy things at the end . Via Electronista

Amazon sold a record number of Kindle Fire HD tablets just one day after the iPad mini was announced , the retailer has confirmed . Wednesday was the biggest day of sales yet for the second iteration of the budget Android tablet , Amazon told AllThingsD . In an emailed statement , Amazon said : `` Wednesday was the $ 199 Kindle Fire HD 's biggest day of sales since launch and up 3x week over week . '' The impressive stat seems to go a long way to answering the question as to whether tablets like the Kindle Fire and Google Nexus 7 can withstand the onslaught of the iPad mini . It would seem logical to assume that Wednesday 's surge in sales may have been caused by customers waiting to see how Apple would price the smaller tablet at Tuesday 's launch event . Potential buyers may have been put off by the £269 ( £329 ) price-tag and decided to pull the trigger on buying a Kindle Fire HD , which is £110 ( $ 130 ) cheaper than Apple 's most affordable 7.9-inch offering . Since announcing its downsized tablet , the general mood of commentators is that Apple may have priced itself out of a direct battle with Amazon and Google and will only be competing with its own 9.7-inch iPad . This is the first indication that those suspicions may be on the money . However , AllThingsD also correctly points out that iPad mini pre-orders sold out almost immediately on Friday morning . Go figure . Via AllThingsD

Amazon has backed itself in the great small-tablet brouhaha , taking the opportunity to compare the Kindle Fire HD to the iPad mini . The incongruous comparison came while Amazon bragged that its sales were up 27 per cent in the third quarter of 2012 and that it 's made a not-even-slightly-shabby $ 13.81 billion ( around £11.7bn or AU $ 13 bn ) over the course of the three months . That 's come from sales of books and other goods through the Amazon retail shopfront as well as the new line of Kindles , tablets and software . Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos posited that the plan to sell devices at no profit was working quite well and even beating 50 Shades of Grey into submission ( something it probably enjoys if our understanding of the series is correct ) : `` Our approach is to work hard to charge less . Sell devices near breakeven and you can pack a lot of sophisticated hardware into a very low price point `` And our approach is working – the $ 199 Kindle Fire HD is the # 1 bestselling product across Amazon worldwide . `` Incredibly , this is true even as measured by unit sales . The next two bestselling products worldwide are our Kindle Paperwhite and our $ 69 Kindle . We 're selling more of each of these devices than the # 4 bestselling product , book three of the Fifty Shades of Grey series . '' The iPad mini comparisons were listed under 'highlights ' , with Amazon pointing out that the Kindle Fire HD offers more pixels , HD playback , `` better audio '' and is cheaper than the iPad mini . Interestingly , there was no zing-laden comparison with arguably more comparable Google Nexus 7 though .

Update : An Amazon spokeswoman referred TechRadar to the AWS Service Health Dashboard , which indicated service availability at Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( aka EC2 ) , Amazon Relational Database Service and AWS Elastic Beanstalk were all experiencing `` performance issues . '' All three services are in the Northern Virginia `` Availability Zone '' and the disruptions are `` impacting a portion of customers in that Availability Zone , '' the spokeswoman said . She did not elaborate which specific sites and services have been affected and when service should return to normal . Problems with Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) are reportedly impacting several sites and services around the web , including Reddit , Pinterest and Foursquare . The reports started coming in around 12 pm PDT Tuesday , indicating issues at the company 's EC2 operations at a Northern Virginia data center were causing a ripple effect of disruption . Flipboard , Pitchfork , `` Minecraft , '' Skitch , Coursera , GitHub , Airbnb , Heroku as well as the three sites mentioned above were all apparently suffering complications and even complete outages At 10:31 a.m. PDT , Reddit tweeted that its `` site is down right now . '' Upon a subsequent TechRadar check at 12:45 p.m. PDT , Reddit appeared to once again be operational , though reports throughout the day have pegged it as down once again . `` Like many other services , we 've been taken down by the outage , '' said Erin Gleason , a spokeswoman for Foursquare , the mobile check-in service , in an interview with the New York Times Bits blog . `` Both the site and the app are inaccessible right now . '' Various reports also had the Netflix site experiencing disruption . In a status board message from 11:26 a.m. PDT , EC2 let customers know what was happening . `` We are currently experiencing degraded performance for EBS volumes in a single Availability Zone in the US-East-1 Region . `` New launches for EBS backed instances are failing and instances using affected EBS voumes will experience degraded performance . '' The disruption does not appear to be impacting major AWS-based sites such as Netflix and Instagram . Another outage caused by a severe electrical storm took down those two major players over the summer . The outage took place at the same Virginia data center and brought with it AWS for an entire weekend . Via The Verge , AllThingsD , AWS Service Health Dashboard , NYT Bits

Jeff Bezos has n't got much patience with the neverending cycle of tech patent lawsuits , reckoning that governments need to step in and change laws . The Amazon CEO , who faces a bit more hardware heat now that Amazon has launched the Android-running Kindle Fire HD tablet , lamented the situation in an interview with the Metro newspaper . `` Patents are supposed to encourage innovation and we 're starting to be in a world where they might start to stifle innovation , '' he said . `` Governments may need to look at the patent system and see if those laws need to be modified because I do n't think some of these battles are healthy for society . `` I love technology , I love invention , I like rapid change , and really it 's the golden age of wireless devices and mobile devices . '' Bezos is n't the only one tiring of the patent hoopla - the UN held a summit earlier this month during which Apple , Google , Microsoft , Samsung and other tech giants got together to try and find a solution . Technology in 2012 has been pockmarked by patent filings and verdicts , the most notable of which is Apple v Samsung in which a US court found in favour of the Cupertino company . It 's not over 'til it 's over , though – Samsung is currently appealing the $ 1 billion ruling so the case is set to rumble on into 2013 .

The tech world took to the announcement of Amazon 's latest two Kindles , the Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Paperwhite , with enthusiasm , but not every Kindle model is riding the wave of good tidings . Amazon 's Kindle DX , the extra-large reader introduced in 2009 , may finally be experiencing an official phase out . The signs became clear Monday , as all evidence of the Kindle DX , including Amazon 's official Kindle comparison tables and Kindle product box images , was apparently scoured from the web . Tellingly , the Kindle DX is no longer being sold directly by Amazon , either , and there 's no indication that it will ever return , though third-party sellers on the website still offer it . TechRadar has reached out to Amazon for comment on what 's going on , but for now the evidence appears to speak for itself . We 'll update this post if and when Amazon decides to officially announce the death of the Kindle DX - or refute this rumor entirely . There are still reports that a second-generation Kindle DX is for sale through Amazon , though its software and hardware is said to be severely out of date . It 's truly unclear what all this means , so hopefully Amazon decides to speak up soon . The Kindle DX has n't been updated since 2010 , so Amazon 's apparent move to discontinue it is n't entirely unexpected . The 10-inch reader reportedly never quite caught on , due possibly to its sheer size and general unwieldiness . Monday 's reports of the Kindle DX 's discontinuation come hot on the heels of a massive discount on the reader , which went from $ 379 ( UK£239 , AU $ 369 ) to $ 299 ( UK£186 , AU $ 291 ) within a week . The price drop may have well been a final effort on Amazon 's part to empty its shelves of Kindle DX stock before discontinuing the device forever . However , some hardcore Kindle DX fans may still hold out hope for a Kindle DX Paperwhite , an extra-large reader with up-to-date tech , though Amazon 's given no indication of such a product 's existence . We can still hope , right ? Via Engadget , The eBook Reader
Amazon is reportedly in the last stages of snapping up Texas Instruments ' mobile processor business . Israeli newspaper Calcalist cites a source who reckons that Amazon is in `` advanced negotiations '' with the chip-maker . TI 's hardware is currently found in the Amazon Kindle Fire HD and it sounds as though Amazon wants to bring the processors in-house in order to save a bit of cash . It emerged last week that the online mega-retailer-turned-tablet-maker does n't make any money on its hardware , including the Fire tablet range , instead bringing in cash from sales of apps , ebooks , films , music and more from its store . For its part , TI has been looking to offload the mobile processor side of its business for a while now . It could mean a healthy cash injection for TI as the deal is predicted to be worth `` billions of dollars '' – the company can put all that lovely cash towards its new focus of embedded chips for cars and that , where it sees dollar-signs in its future .

Apple picked a high-profile executive of its own Monday , snatching William Stasior , former president and CEO of Amazon 's A9 division , to reportedly lead Cupertino 's Siri unit . His exact job title is still unclear , though AllThingsD picked up Stasior 's new role from sources . Stasior joined Amazon in 2003 as the director of search and navigation before working his way up to become president and CEO of A9 . The Amazon unit focused on developing search and advertising technology before delving into search for Amazon and other online retail sites . Statsior 's new role as head of the Siri group comes at a key time for Apple , having lost former Siri CEO and co-founder Dag Kittlaus last year and Adam Cheyer , Siri 's other co-founder , earlier this year . Apple 's acquisition of Stasior and his particular background could indicate a shift for the company toward search technologies . Apple recently decided to ditch Google Maps in favor of its own proprietary service with the launch of iOS 6 . Even though Apple 's success with its native maps is up for debate ( the app has a seemingly inordinate amount of problems ) it does highlight the firm 's desire to develop and offer proprietary services whenever it can . Of course , Siri still has a long way to go before the voice-controlled assistant could hope to replace Google 's own search algorithm . However , it 's good to remember that there was a time not too long ago when abandoning Google Maps seemed equally far-fetched . Via AllThingsD

Amazon has pledged to offer partial refunds on some Kindle book sales , after three publishers agreed , in principle , to settle a price-fixing anti-trust case . The online giant emailed customers in the United States this weekend informing them they could receive between $ 0.30 and $ 1.32 ( £.082 ) for each applicable Kindle ebook purchased between April 2010 and May 2012 . The refunds will be on books published by the HarperCollins , Simon & Schuster and Hachette , the three companies offering to settle the case brought against them , Apple and two-other publishers . The publishers and Apple have been accused by the U.S. Department of Justice of colluding to keep the prices of ebooks high and threatening to blacklist other retailers if they sought to sell ebooks for less . The settlement , which is still to be approved by the judge presiding over the case , would see the publishers set up a $ 69m fund from which the rebates would be distributed as Amazon account credit ( or a personal cheque , if desired ) . Amazon , which has been attempting to lower prices of ebooks for quite some-time , told customers : `` In addition to the account credit , the settlements impose limitations on the publishers ' ability to set e-book prices . `` We think these settlements are a big win for customers and look forward to lowering prices on more Kindle books in the future . '' The judge will rule on the proposed settlements in February 2013 , whereas Apple , Penguin and Macmillan will continue to fight the allegations . However , do n't expect any rebats to land in Amazon accounts outside of the U.S. as the ruling is likely only to apply to customers Stateside . Via Reuters

Amazon has released a statement clarifying some of the limitations of its new Kindle Paperwhite e-reader . The online retailer says that the illumination offered by patented built-in light , a key feature of the new device , is `` not perfectly even , '' after some reviewers and users pointed out the discrepancy . Amazon has served-up pictures of how the illumination can appear different , with darker patches appearing near the bottom , when using the Paperwhite in poorly-lit reading environments . `` These variations are normal and are located primarily in the margin where text is not present , '' said Amazon , which announced the device for the UK market on Thursday . `` The illumination is more even than that created by a book light or lighted cover . The contrast , resolution and illumination of the Paperwhite display is a significant step-up from our prior generation . '' Amazon continues to claim that the Kindle Paperwhite is the `` best Kindle we 've ever made by far , '' largely thanks to the new 6-inch dsiplay , which offers 62 per cent more pixels and 25 per cent better contrast However , it is also missing some familar features and boasts only half the storage available on legacy devices . Amazon has also explained the reasoning behind these omissions in its statement The company wrote : `` Kindle Paperwhite does not have audio or Text-to-Speech . This makes the device smaller and lighter than it would otherwise be . Audio and an improved Text-to-Speech engine are supported on Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD . `` The Kindle Paperwhite has 2 GB of storage . Some previous Kindle models had 4GB of storage . 2GB allows you to hold up to 1,100 books locally on your device . In addition , your entire Kindle library is stored for free in the Amazon cloud , and you can easily move books from the cloud onto your device . '' Meanwhile , Amazon has revealed that it makes zero profit on its Kindle hardware , and sells all devices at cost - a stark contrast to the policy Apple adopts for its portable devices . CEO Jeff Bezos told the BBC : `` We sell the hardware at our cost , so it is break-even on the hardware . `` We want to make money when people use our devices , not when people buy our devices .

In an effort to stay competitive with its online rivals , brick and mortar retailer Best Buy will match prices with Amazon and other online retailers this holiday shopping season . Best Buy will also offer free home delivery on goods that go out of stock in the store . The electronics store still has n't given the public the full details on the campaign , so there are sure to be some excluded products and fine print as the plan comes to light . Since the strategy is n't fully official yet , it will also be a few weeks until the price-matching hits stores . But , the plan is sure to be fully realized by the time the shopping hordes storm Best Buys during the post-Thanksgiving shopathon Black Friday . The pricing-matching campaign is a smart move in a market where online retailers are gaining more power , especially when it comes time to hunt for holiday deals . The one-day internet buying frenzy , Cyber Monday , is gaining as much prominence as its physical end-of-the-week counterpart . Last year , the online shop fest raked in $ 1.25 billion for digital stores , according to comScore . Best Buy 's plan is also a response to the chain becoming a brick-and-mortar showroom , at least in part . `` Showrooming '' describes a growing trend of shoppers coming in the store to get an in-person look at the products they are considering . They then leave the store to buy the same electronics for a cheaper price from online rivals . Though Best Buy 's new Chief Executive Hubert Joly said the phenomenon was blown out of proportion , the electronics chain does admit it could be closing more deals . It says about 40 percent of people who walk into Best Buy purchase something during their visit . `` We have a tremendous opportunity to increase that close rate , '' Matthew Furman , a spokesman for Best Buy , told the Wall Street Journal . And with a can-do , optimistic attitude like that , Best Buy just might turn the tides of the holiday shopping extravaganza . We 'll see when the full details of Best Buy 's price-matching plans are revealed . Via WSJ ( $ )
The Amazon Kindle Touch has been ditched by the online retail giant in favour of its new , back-lit Kindle Paperwhite e-reader . Launched just last year , the Kindle Touch was Amazon 's first touchscreen e-reader , coupling the famous e-ink display with on screen controls – removing most physical menu buttons , with just the lock key and home button remaining . However Amazon has now called time on the device , with the Kindle Paperwhite stepping up to the touchscreen , e-reader plate . A spokesperson for the retail giant told TechRadar : `` The Kindle Touch is available to purchase through our high street retail partners , including Tesco , John Lewis and Argos . It is no longer available at Amazon.co.uk . '' However , a reason as to why was not given . If you 're tempted by the Kindle Paperwhite then US customers can snap one up today for $ 119 , or $ 179 if you want 3G action . In the UK the Wi-Fi and 3G readers are up for pre-order , priced at £109 and £169 respectively , and will start shipping on October 25 .

According to a new book , Amazon was keen to buy Netflix in 1999 . Quite understandable given its potential . But it only offered $ 12 million for the then-startup . The derisory offer was rejected and the rest , as they say , is history ; Netflix now has a market value of a cool $ 3.7 billion . The ingeniously-titled Netflixed is a history of the company that details the 1999 meeting between Amazon 's Jeff Bezos and Netflix founders Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph . And yes ( haha ) , the book is available at Amazon . So what happened next ? Hastings tried to sell to Blockbuster for $ 50 million , but it rejected the offer . Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010 while Netflix has gone from strength to strength , though it has had recent problems of its own , not least when it attempted to sell off its DVD business and its share price declined . Dish Network has just announced it is to abandon US plans to relaunch Blockbuster as a Netflix rival . And just two weeks ago , Hastings called Amazon Prime Instant Video `` a confusing mess '' , Netflix has undergone a successful international rollout over the last couple of years though , while its userbase is increasing , profits were down in the second quarter by a whopping 91 per cent and the company warned it may not hit its goal of seven million new subscribers this year . Amazon tried its own subscription services in various territories until it eventually decided it would buy LoveFilm outright in 2011 ( it previously had a stake in the company ) for around £200 million ( $ 322 million USD ) .

In a world of dull tech CEOs – ten points for anyone who can say three interesting things about Samsung 's CEO ; hell , ten points for anyone who knows his name without Googling it*– Jeff Bezos stands out . His Amazon empire has crushed retail rivals , provided a platform for the internet 's biggest names and become a key player in the tablet business , and he 's just getting started . Is Jeff Bezos the new Steve Jobs ? The question is n't as crazy as it sounds . While Bezos is a businessman first and a technologist second , he shares the late Jobs ' ability to see into the future - and like Jobs , he thinks big and plays for keeps . Although Bezos studied science and computer science , he did n't start off in the tech industry : in 1994 he was pulling in a six-figure salary from Wall Street investment firm DE Shaw & Co , where he was the youngest senior vice-president the firm had ever had . Bezos was quick to recognise the potential of e-commerce and jumped ship to start a new business , Amazon.com , which would sell books online . He did n't choose books because he loved books , or for sentimental reasons ; of the 20-odd potential products he considered selling , he decided that books were the best bet because traditional bookshops could only ever stock a tiny proportion of the available titles . Internet bookshops had , and have , no such limits . In Amazon 's early days , Bezos demonstrated a Jobsian level of salesmanship , innovation and marketing . He sweet-talked family and friends into fronting $ 1 million for his new venture , was quick to realise the power of user reviews and automatic product recommendations , and sent trucks past Barnes & Noble bookshops advertising Amazon 's URL . Trucks aside , Amazon did n't advertise at first : users loved the site , its speed and its prices ( helped in part by Amazon 's willingness to lose money - it did n't make a profit until late 2001 ) and told their family and friends about it . Like Jobs , Bezos is n't the easiest boss to work for – there are tales of Bezos berating employees over relatively small issues - but where Jobs hated imperfection Bezos seems quite happy with it . As the WSJ reports , `` Bezos 's philosophy was to get to market quickly , in order to get a jump on the competition , and to fix problems and improve the site as people started using it . '' He took the same approach to the Kindle , and you can see it in the Kindle Fire too : Bezos 's method is to launch fast , launch big , and file down the rough edges later . Steve Jobs liked to quote the hockey player Wayne Gretzky , who said `` I skate to where the puck is going to be , not where it has been . '' Bezos , we 're sure , likes the sentiment too , because that 's exactly what he does : he predicts what 's going to disrupt his business and does the disruption himself . The iPhone exists because Steve Jobs knew that phones would largely replace stand-alone MP3 players , and many of Amazon 's products exist for similar reasons : if anyone 's going to disrupt an Amazon business , Bezos wants it to be Amazon . When Bezos realised that ebooks would ultimately outsell printed ones he built an ereading device and kept on refining it ; when he realised that traditional publishers could be disrupted he provided an indie publishing platform and set up a book publishing division too . When it was clear that discs would die out , Amazon sold MP3s , offered a cloud-based music player and started streaming TV and movies through Amazon Prime . When cloud computing started to become a big deal , Amazon offered storage and servers . And when it became apparent that smartphones and tablets would replace many PCs and e-readers , Amazon made apps , an App Store , and the Kindle Fire tablets . If the rumour mill is correct , Amazon 's even working on a phone . There 's a strong argument that Amazon is taking Microsoft 's place at the top table of tech : its $ 115 billion market capitalisation may be roughly half of Microsoft 's , but if the future of the PC is the Personal Cloud rather than the Personal Computer , a battle not of hardware but of ecosystems and media services , then Amazon is already doing rather well . Five years ago the idea of Amazon kicking it with Apple , Google and Microsoft might have seemed rather far-fetched , but that 's exactly where Amazon is today . Not bad for a bookshop . Amazon 's phenomenal rise is an impressive achievement , but Bezos is just getting started : where other tech CEOs might tell you that the sky 's the limit , Bezos has loftier plans . In 2000 , he founded Blue Origin , an aerospace company that 's `` working to lower the cost of spaceflight so that many people can afford to go . '' Its motto , `` gradatim ferociter '' , is Latin for `` step by step , ferociously '' . It 's a good motto for an aerospace company , but it 's a pretty good fit for Jeff Bezos too . * It 's Kwon Oh-hyun .

Amazon 's Kindle Paperwhite , the 6-inch e-reader introduced Sept. 6 alongside the Kindle Fire HD , has effectively sold out , according to reports Wednesday . Any order placed from now into the foreseeable future will take between 4-6 weeks to fill . If you click to read the device 's specs and place an order on Amazon.com , the site delivers the bad news . `` Due to popular demand , orders placed today are expected to ship in four to six weeks , '' the message reads . At a reasonable $ 119 for the base model and $ 179 for a 3G bump-up , the luminous e-reader has 62 percent more pixels than other models and 25 percent better contrast . Its 8-week battery and ability to read in any scenery - from bright sunlight to low-lit living room - has clearly made this reader a popular choice . High demand has hit the device before . At the end of September , consumers who ordered the device were told it would n't ship until Oct. 22 . At the time , Amazon limited orders to five per customer - now that number stands at two . As of yet , there 's no international shipping date for the Paperwhite , though some reports have it landing in the U.K. , other parts of Europe , Australia , Canada , and other countries at the beginning of next year .

If you bought a Kindle device during your post-Thanksgiving shopping binge this year , then you contributed to the e-reader 's biggest weekend ever . Amazon announced Tuesday that sales of its Kindle e-reader device family skyrocketed over the Black Friday weekend , with Cyber Monday sales making up the biggest single day ever for global Kindle sales . The bookseller did not disclose specific sales numbers , but revealed in a press release that the Amazon Kindle had achieved several `` milestones '' since the launch of the Kindle Fire HD in September . On Cyber Monday , a day that has come to represent the best online deals of the year , Amazon offered the original Kindle Fire for $ 129 , a deal that `` customers flocked to , '' according to Amazon , making it the most popular Cyber Monday deal ever offered on Amazon 's online retail site . In addition , the Kindle Fire 's successor , the Kindle Fire HD , has become the most gifted and wished for product on Amazon worldwide since its launch in early September . Globally , nine of the ten best-sellers on Amazon as a whole since the Fire HD 's launch are Kindles , Kindle accessories and digital content , according to Amazon 's report , and the top four spots are occupied exclusively by Kindle e-readers and Kindle Fire devices . Naturally , Amazon is pleased with the success of the Kindle family of e-readers and tablets , which currently includes the Kindle , Kindle Paperwhite , Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD ( but not the Kindle DX ) . `` We 're excited that customers made this Black Friday and Cyber Monday the best ever for Kindle worldwide , '' said Amazon Kindle Vice President Dave Limp in Tuesday 's press release . `` Cyber Monday was the biggest day ever for Kindle sales , and we 're looking forward to millions of customers opening a new Kindle this holiday season .

Microsoft 's rumored Surface phone has , for lack of a better word , resurfaced with word that Foxconn is manufacturing the device . According to a Digitimes report , Foxconn International Holdings , a subsidiary of Foxconn Electronics , received orders from Microsoft for a handsets with a proposed launch of mid-2013 . The report follows rumors last week from Chinese site IT Home , which cited anonymous sources claiming a Microsoft smartphone to already be in production at Foxconn . Earlier this month , reports indicated that Microsoft was testing its own brand handset with various suppliers in Asia , presumably looking for a manufacturing partner . Sources also speculated that the smartphone will have a display size between 4- to 5- inches and of course run on Windows Phone 8 for its OS . After Microsoft jumped into the mobile hardware ring with its Surface tablet , many analysts believed that a Surface phone would be next . Potential competitor Nokia even welcomed the idea to encourage competition for a strong Windows Phone ecosystem , though that tune may change should the rumors prove to be true . The Digitimes report also brought another company into play , adding that Amazon has also picked Foxconn to manufacture its own smartphone . The Kindle maker has so far stuck to tablets for its mobile devices , but rumors have been circulating all year that a smartphone makes sense as the company 's next step . In September , Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos noted that the company has some new devices in the works for next year , which rekindled Amazon smartphone rumors . Between the rumored Surface phone for Windows Phone 8 and the Amazon handset ( expected to run on Android ) , it seems that next year will see two industry giants make smartphone debuts . If the mid-2013 launch timeframe is true , then they could arrive just in time to go toe-to-toe with the iPhone 5S , or possibly iPhone 7 at the rate Apple goes through iterations .

With Cyber Monday in full swing across the United States , a new study found that Amazon is the big winner where online shopping is concerned , though there 's good news for small businesses that offer online shopping . Deepfield , which produces technology to track and analyse cloud-based service performance , released findings from a large scale , multi-month study of online shopping Monday , the same day Americans hit the internet in search of post-Thanksgiving Day deals . Using data culled from internet backbone traffic across North America , Deepfield found that Amazon and sites it owns lead the pack with 14 percent of all online shopping taking place on a daily basis . Amazon is expected to see the bulk of Cyber Monday 2012 shopping ( as it does every year ) , however there is a silver lining for competitors and small businesses shilling products online . According to Deepfield 's data , the only e-tailer that comes within reach of Amazon is eBay , the ever-changing auction website that currently sees 8.8 percent of daily internet shoppers . The next four spots were taken up exclusively by online portals like Shopify ( 5.4 percent ) , Zappos ( 3.8 percent ) , Quidsi ( 3.1 percent ) and Shopzilla ( 2.9 percent ) , some of which are n't even household names . Zappos and Quidsi , by the way , are Amazon-owned properties , but Deepfield explained that , in its estimation , the sites are big enough to warrant independent data . Shopify 's figures are particularly interesting because although less than half of the numbers Amazon pulls in , the site is an online storefront hosting service for more than 30,000 retailers . Its No . 3 position points to a decent number of shoppers heading towards smaller-scale stores while also indicating Cyber Monday could be a sales boon for sites that are n't Amazon or eBay . As for the rest of the pack , Walmart mustered 2.3 percent of internet shopping traffic , trailed by Groupon , Target , Footlocker and Best Buy . Best Buy , though struggling , did manage to spike its internet traffic from 1.5 percent to more than 5 percent over the Thanksgiving weekend thanks to deep price cuts and millions spent on promo material .

Nintendo will no doubt be thankful to Amazon Instant Video , this turkey day , for bolstering the on-demand video line-up on the new Wii U . Instant Video , which joins Netflix and Hulu+ on the newly-released console , brings access to over 140,000 movies and TV shows , including the latest releases - available to buy or rent . Subscribers to the Amazon Prime 2-day free delivery service also get an additional 30,000 titles to stream free of charge . Wii U owners can use the 6.2-inch GamePad to browse and select content for playback on the television screen . Playback is also possible on the GamePad itself . `` We 're constantly working to create the best streaming video experience for our customers , and to do that it 's essential to provide access on as many devices as possible , '' said Anthony Bay , Vice President of Worldwide Digital Video for Amazon.com . `` The Amazon Instant Video app on Wii U gives customers more ways to enjoy video in the comfort of their home . The Second Screen Experience lets customers browse , search and even play movies or TV directly on the GamePad controller . In addition , new features in the app allow kids and parents to easily discover family-friendly programming for all age groups . '' UPDATE : Alongside Amazon , YouTube has now launched a dedicated Wii U application , which also works with the console 's touchscreen GamePad . The launch of both Amazon and YouTube , following Netflix and Huli gives the Wii U its full quotient of on-demand apps , which were promised upon launch . Meanwhile the Nintendo TVii service , which bonds with the user 's cable TV package , is still missing in action .

Nintendo 's Wii U video game console launched on Sunday to an enthusiastic reception , with a packed midnight debut in New York and many stores reportedly selling out quickly . But all was not fun and games on Wii U launch day , as Nintendo fans quickly discovered that some of the console 's promised features were n't yet available . The absence of several of the Wii U 's video on demand apps , including Hulu Plus , Amazon Instant Video and Youtube , first came to light Friday , when Nintendo promised each would arrive `` in the coming weeks . '' But contrary to Friday 's report , there actually was one streaming video app available upon the Wii U 's release : Netflix . It 's unclear why the U 's Hulu , Amazon and Youtube apps were missing from the console when the new Nintendo system was released , but early adopters were no doubt glad that Netflix managed to get its app out regardless . Netflix 's Director of Product Innovation Chris Jaffe on Sunday wrote in a blog post , `` Nintendo products are popular with our members and today we are happy to announce that Netflix is available on Wii U ! '' Jaffe highlighted the advantages of using Netflix on Wii U , including 1080p streaming and playback controls accessible from the Wii U 's GamePad controller . The GamePad also features a full touch keyboard for Netflix searches and the ability to play video directly on its small but beautiful screen . So what about the Wii U 's Hulu Plus , Amazon Instant and Youtube apps ? The Wii U 's dashboard at launch featured placeholder icons for the three missing video on demand apps , and the Wii U 's eShop digital storefront displayed `` coming soon '' over images for the absent apps . TechRadar has reached out to representatives of all three companies to find out if they have any news to share regarding when the Wii U 's video on demand apps will become available . Meanwhile , the Wii U 's much-touted TVii feature , which Nintendo promised would provide a personalized , aggregated video and cable hub upon the Wii U 's launch , is currently unavailable as well . No doubt Nintendo 's `` in the coming weeks '' prediction applies there as well - one can hope , at least .

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has declared Amazon Instant Video his company 's best-ever competitor , but says the challenge is costing Amazon a fortune . According to a report from AllThingsD , Hastings has estimated that Amazon is losing between $ 500 million ( UK£314 , AUD $ 483 ) and $ 1 billion ( UK£630 , AUD $ 0.96 ) a year through content costs . Amazon has been splashing the cash on expensive deals with Hollywood in order to rival Netflix ' offering , but is less able than Netflix to cover those costs through dedicated subscriptions to the streaming service . The company only offers Instant Video in the U.S. as an added bonus for its $ 79-a-year Prime customers , which brings free 2-day delivery and also includes a free book from the Kindle Lending Library each month . Hastings had previously referred to the combined offering as a `` confusing mess , '' saying it lacked `` brand clarity . '' The Netflix boss came to these latest estimates by analysing how much Amazon spent during content battles with Netflix and claimed that the losses are spread over Instant Video and European Lovefilm service , which Amazon owns . In response , an Amazon spokesperson told AllThingsD : `` We do n't comment on our individual investments but it 's correct that Prime Instant Video is an amazing value for customers . Not only do Prime members get unlimited streaming video , but they also get free 2-day shipping and the Kindle Owners ' Lending Library as well . '' Meanwhile , Amazon has also stopped offering the Prime service , which includes Instant Video , for $ 7.99 a month . The company took aim at rivals Netflix and Hulu by offering access to the service on a month-to-month basis , but new customers will no longer be accepted . Via AllThingsD

Prices for Amazon ebooks may soon take a competitive dip , according to sources familiar with an antitrust probe against Apple and four publishers taking place in Europe . The sources , speaking with Reuters , said European Union regulators will accept an offer by Apple and the publishers giving Amazon the go-ahead to sell ebooks for less than its competitors . The offer on the table would let retailers independently set prices or discounts on online books for the next two years , plus suspend `` most-favored nation '' contracts for five years . If approved , the EU will drop an investigation into antitrust practices that involved deals between the publishers and Apple to sell books through iTunes at exclusive discounts . The deals - between Apple and Simon & Schuster , HarperCollins , Hachette Livre and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrink , owner of Macmillan - were only viable as long as the publishers did n't extend those rates to other sellers , including Amazon . Apple and the gaggle of publishers made the proposal in September , at which time the European Commission said it would seek feedback from competing companies and consumers . One Reuters source said commissioners have n't asked for more concessions . `` The commission is likely to accept the offer and announce its decision next month , '' the source said . Pearson Plc 's Penguin group is also under investigation but was not part of the September offer . TechRadar has reached out to Amazon and Apple and will update this story if and when the companies respond . Via Reuters
Amazon has quietly begun offering a monthly subscription to its Amazon Prime service , in a move that will place it in more direct competition with the likes of Netflix and Hulu . Unofficial Netflix news site Hacking Netflix reported Tuesday morning that a reader had noticed the new pricing , which offers an Amazon Prime subscription for a monthly fee of $ 7.99 . Previously an Amazon Prime sub cost $ 79.99 per year , and though the new monthly price will add up to $ 95.88 annually , some users may prefer the flexibility of going month-to-month . That may prove especially true for customers who are used to Hulu Plus and Netflix 's subscription packages - exactly who Amazon is gunning for . Amazon may escalate its competition with other streaming video providers , but Hulu is n't about to back down either . Hulu Plus subscribers will finally have access to CBS programming in January 2013 , as a deal between the two was announced Monday . The non-exclusive partnership will last for multiple years and include more than 2,600 episodes of shows like `` Medium , '' `` Numb3rs , '' `` CSI : Miami , '' `` Star Trek , '' `` I Love Lucy '' and `` The Twilight Zone . '' Hulu Plus subscribers wo n't be the only ones able to take advantage of the new CBS content , as a selection of CBS shows will also be rotated through Hulu 's ad-driven free site . Amazon and Hulu are doing what they can to compete , while Netflix CEO Reed Hastings recently defended unpopular pricing and criticized his competitors ' products . In September , the Netflix CEO called Amazon Prime Instant a `` confusing mess , '' apparently confident that the service is not a threat to Netflix 's profits . But TechRadar noted back in February that `` an Amazon Prime monthly subscription service would put the company in direct competition with the current kingpin of home streaming , Netflix , '' making Tuesday 's news particularly interesting . Hulu , meanwhile , is in the midst of some major shake-ups , if an August memo is anything to go by . So far , no one service has emerged as clearly superior to the other two , especially with Hulu and Amazon working so hard to compete with Netflix . With death and taxes the only certainties in life , though , it 's best to remain vigilant when it comes to streaming video options . Via Hacking Netflix , MarketWatch

The tablet market grew by more than a bump between the second and third quarter of 2012 , according to recent data gathered by the International Data Corporation ( IDC ) . Globally , 27.8 million tablets sold in Q3 , growing the market 49.5 percent year over year and 6.7 percent from Q2 . Android tablets had a winning quarter , IDC reported , while the world 's biggest slate maker saw its share slump significantly . `` Android shipments , led by Samsung and Amazon , surged during the quarter , at the expense of Apple , which saw its share slip notably during the quarter , '' IDC noted . The gloomy take on Apple 's past quarter did n't let up , as the IDC reported the company 's total market share dropped from 65.5 percent in Q2 to 50.4 percent in Q3 . `` After a very strong second quarter , Apple saw growth slow as both consumer and commercial ( including education ) shipments declined , and rumors of a forthcoming iPad mini began to heat up , '' said Tom Mainelli , research director for Tablets at IDC . Consumers interested in slates made by Apple likely sat the quarter out , Mainelli noted , though the fourth quarter will be `` very good '' for Cupertino thanks to the iPad mini and iPad 4 . The mini , however , has its own hang-ups . `` [ We ] believe the mini 's relatively high $ 329 ( UK£269 , AUD $ 369 ) starting price leaves plenty of room for Android vendors to build upon the success they achieved in the third quarter . '' Apple reported Monday it sold three million new iPads over the last three days , though the exact breakdown of how many of each left store shelves remains unclear . Amazon , Asus and Lenovo all saw growth over the year , the IDC chirped , helping the three companies round out the top five market holders . Amazon , maker of the `` worldwide bestseller '' Kindle Fire HD , jumped from 4.8 percent in the second quarter to 9 percent in Q3 . The leap is even more impressive since Amazon only shipped the tablet ( in both 7- and 8.9-inch variants ) to the U.S. , though it started sending it to five more countries in Q4 . Google 's Nexus 7 helped Asus nab an 8.6 percent market share , while hearty shipments to China let Lenovo take 1.4 percent . While the other top tablet makers gobbled up a bigger slice of the market from Apple , Samsung stole the spotlight with shipments totaling 5.1 million worldwide , up 115 percent from Q2 . The South Korean company only sold 1.2 million tablets in Q3 2011 , when it held 6.5 percent of the market . That amounts to a 325 percent increase year over year . Its global market share for Q3 stood at 18.4 percent , allowing it to surface as the clear quarter victor . `` Samsung took advantage of an opportunity in the second quarter , '' said Ryan Reith , program manager for IDC 's Mobile Device Trackers . `` The company offers a wide range of tablet offerings across multiple screen sizes and colors , and that clearly resonated with more buyers this quarter . Its growth to 18.4 percent of worldwide market share during the quarter represents the first time a competitor has attained this level of share since the original launch of the iPad . '' How the newly announced Nexus 10 impacts Samsung 's growth ( and Apple 's tablet dominance ) moving deeper into the holiday quarter will be worth a watch . Apple , the IDC warned , better watch out as even Windows 8 and Windows RT tablets by Microsoft , though pricey , will give the firm a run for its money . `` Competitors are turning up the pressure on market leader Apple , '' Reith said . Via IDC
Teardowns of two more tablets has revealed firms are making money from their slates left , right and centre , with the Amazon Kindle Fire HD and Microsoft Surface the latest devices to be taken apart . The folks over at IHS have taken the screwdriver to the two tablets , shortly after revealing its findings on the iPad mini , which makes Apple a not too shabby $ 141 ( around £88/AU $ 136 ) per unit . It 's been well documented that Amazon has sold its Kindle ereaders and original Kindle Fire devices at cost price , hoping to make its money back from users purchasing books and apps on their newly acquired tablet . However , according to the latest teardowns , the online retailer is now making a 15 % profit on each Kindle Fire HD sold , which equates to about $ 30 ( around £18/ AU $ 28 ) per tablet . While that 's not a huge margin , it 's at least positive news for Amazon who will be hoping its new tablet can win over consumers looking at the Google Nexus 7 or iPad mini . Meanwhile Microsoft will be rubbing its hands together with glee every time one of its Surface tablets is picked off a shelf , as the Redmond-based firm pockets a tidy $ 228 ( around £142/ AU $ 220 ) for each slate sold . The Microsoft Surface price raised some eyebrows when it was first announced , with many considering it to be too high . If the estimates from the teardowns are correct , it looks like the software giant really is in it for the money . From IHS via AllThingsD

Amazon is one of the best places to do your holiday shopping ; low prices , fast shipping and the biggest selection of any retailer ever made many lives easier this season . But one user who claims to have received a stolen iPhone from the online bookseller would likely disagree . Tweeter Ben Dreyfuss claimed on Tuesday morning that the iPhone he bought for his mother turned out to be hot - i.e. , it was not acquired honestly . He learned of the device 's unsavory history when his mother tried to activate the iPhone with Verizon , representatives of which informed her that it had been blacklisted . Dreyfuss tweeted that the iPhone in question had been listed on Amazon 's warehouse deals as refurbished . He claimed that it originally came from an Amazon trade-in ; in other words , someone likely stole the phone and sold it to Amazon . Should Amazon be responsible for checking whether the merchandise it sells is hot ? Probably . Either way , Dreyfuss reported on Twitter that Amazon had instructed him to return it and was `` very apologetic . '' TechRadar has reached out to Amazon to determine exactly what its policy is in such a case , but the retailer has yet to respond . Hopefully , his mother understands why she received illicit goods for Christmas - maybe try a swap meet next time , Ben ? Via Gizmodo
Netflix users hoping to sit down with their families and watch a classic Christmas movie on Monday , Christmas eve , may have been disappointed . The streaming video service was plagued with outages across North America ( and possibly beyond - TechRadar has reached out to Netflix to determine the extend of the issues , but the company has n't responded ) . Netflix blamed the Christmas eve service outages on Amazon , which experienced issues with its Elastic Load Balancing ( ELB ) , which normally helps with traffic distribution , throughout the holiday . With no Die Hard or Christmas Vacation to watch , some users were forced to interact with their families , while others took to Twitter instead to spew complaints in Netflix 's direction . The official Netflix U.S. account tweeted on Monday evening , `` We 're sorry for the Christmas Eve outage . Terrible timing ! Engineers are working on it now . '' The @ Netflixhelps account and Netflix Cloud Architect Adrian Cockcroft interacted with customers on Twitter late into the night and early in the morning on Christmas day . One tweeter threatened to switch to cable , sparking an age-old debate . Others asked Netflix for parenting advice , wondering what to do with their kids in the hours before bedtime and even threatening to sue the streaming video company . A third group sat back and watched the drama unfold , criticizing outraged parents who seemingly could n't be bothered to interact with their children . Even we at TechRadar were not immune to the Netflix Christmas outage ; it took almost half an hour of error messages to get Sherlock to play . Amazon Web Services ' Twitter account reported ELB issues in its US-EAST-1 zone on Monday evening , and there has n't been another update since . Nevertheless , Netflix tweeted on Tuesday morning that everything should be `` back to normal . '' TechRadar 's hypothesis is that Santa took a break from home invasions and dropped by Amazon to fix the outage himself . Monday 's Christmas eve Netflix outage echoed an Amazon Web Services issue in October that took down reddit , Pinterest , Foursquare , Pitchfork , and even popular indie game Minecraft . A similar issue occurred in June , when Instagram , Pinterest and , yes , Netflix went down because of Amazon . Maybe it 's time to consider an alternative ? Via Techcrunch

Amazon is looking to increase the amount of regional content available on its platforms . Prime Music just signed up with Indian Performing Right Society ( IPRS ) while Prime Video is looking to integrate more content from South India and sports streaming . The IPRS enables Prime Music to have access to more than a million unique tracks in multiple languages across different eras and genres . This tie-up is significant as IPRS is the sole authority to issue music licenses within the country . This organization collects royalties on the behalf of artists and distributes them accordingly between writers , composers , and publishers of music . Amazon Prime Video , since its inception in India around a year ago , has a huge library of regional shows in five different local languages . Amazon ’ s Prime Video service is growing with the most speed in India as compared to anywhere else in the world . James Farrell , Head of Content in the Asia-Pacific region , commented , “ We haven ’ t announced any originals yet from the South but we are looking to do as much as can be done . ” Tim Leslie , Vice President of Amazon Video International , also indicated that Amazon Prime Video is looking to expand into sports content globally stating , `` It ’ s day one in sports for us and we ’ re getting involved in it . '' In the US , they ’ ve already started streaming American football and is currently in the process of striking deals for other sports such as tennis . Currently , Amazon does not stream sports in India but this trend is probably trickle down to the Indian platform once the international structure has been established . Currently Hotstar has exclusive digital rights to stream all ICC events in India . The Indian market is of prime importance for Amazon since it ’ s been on a constant upward trajectory even since it ’ s local launch . Its unique outlook for providing region-specific original content has also worked out well with shows such as Breathe .

Amazon Appstore downloads have increased in tandem with the amount of Kindle Fire tablets the online retailer is selling . `` App downloads in the Appstore have grown more than 500 percent over the previous year , '' said Amazon in a press release . The correlation between app downloads and Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD purchases is more than a coincidence , according to GigaOM . The rise in Amazon 's tablet sales are thought to be one of the main reasons that the Amazon Appstore has experienced tremendous growth over the last twelve months . Although Kindle Fires are Android-based devices , they can not download apps via Google Play . Their restriction to the Amazon Appstore is likely to have helped drive numbers up . Amazon should be able to maintain its Appstore download growth thanks to strong sales of its tablets on Black Friday and Cyber Monday . The Amazon Kindle had its best week ever last month , with Kindle Fire HD becoming the store 's No . 1 most gifted item , according to the company . Amazon does n't disclose hard numbers , but Cyber Monday , and in particular a $ 129 deal on last year 's Kindle Fire , helped its e-reader line reach its biggest single-day sales record . Of course , the recent spike in app downloads does n't account for all of the Kindle Fires waiting to be gifted over the holidays . The unwrapping of new Kindle Fires around the globe on Dec. 25 should give the Appstore another increase in app downloads in 2013 , whether or not there 's an Amazon phone . Via GigaOM

Amazon has extended the reach of the X-Ray for Books feature to its Kindle apps for iPhone , iPad and iPod touch . The functionality had only appeared on Kindle readers and Kindle Fire tablets until today and gives readers a neat snapshot of a book 's themes and characters and reveals where they pop up throughout the text . Clicking on a character 's name will bring up a timeline of their appearances throughout the book and in many cases a biography and a Wikipedia entry . The supplementary information is n't accessed through the web , but is downloaded as an accompanying offline file when the book is purchased from the Kindle store . The roll out for the iOS devices is an interesting one , as X-Ray is one of the few features that distinguishes the Kindle reading experience on Amazon 's devices . It shows , once again , that Amazon is n't necessarily concerned with which device users are reading their Kindle books from , as long as they 're bought from its online portal . If Amazon can make its reader experience better than Apple 's built-in iBooks option then it can use Apple 's own mobile devices against it . Just last month Amazon rolled out the X-Ray feature for movies on Kindle Fire tablets , allowing users to access information from the Internet Movie Database ( IMDb ) when they pause the film .

Android phones and tablets are amazingly capable little multimedia powerhouses , especially when it comes to playing music . But there 's still a digital divide when it comes to getting a huge collection of songs from your computer to the device , especially given the fiddly nature of connecting cables and syncing files . Fortunately , Amazon 's MP3 app makes this process a lot easier . You need to install a small piece of software on your computer , which uploads copies of your music files to the internet . From here you can access and download the files on your Android device , with the added bonus that your music is always backed up on the internet . We 're starting this tutorial on a computer , so make sure yours is ready to go . On your computer , open Internet Explorer or Firefox ( the Cloud Player does n't work with Chrome ) and go to amazon.co.uk/cloudplayer . You may be asked to log in to Amazon at this point - if you do n't already have an account , click 'No , I am a new customer ' , followed by 'Sign in… ' to create one . You 're now presented with Amazon 's Cloud Player . Any songs you 've previously bought via Amazon are displayed here , and you can play them from within your browser . You can access this page from any computer , making it ideal for listening to music while you 're at work - if you 're allowed , of course . Next , click 'Import your music ' and you 're prompted to get the Amazon Music Importer . Click 'Download Now ' followed by 'Run ' , then click 'Continue ' once it 's loaded up . Click 'Authorise Device ' to enable Amazon Music Importer on your computer . Click 'Start scan ' to search your computer for music files . If you have more than 250 music files on your computer , click 'Select music ' and click the checkboxes next to your favourite artists , then click 'Import selected ' . If you have fewer than 250 , simply click 'Import all ' . It may take a while , so you might as well fire up your Android device as it 's happening . Open Google Play and search for 'Amazon MP3 ' . Tap 'Install ' to download it , then 'Open ' . Next , tap 'Player ' . Choose 'Sign in to Amazon ' , then enter the email address and password you used in step one . When the Cloud Player starts , you should find all the music you 've imported from your computer . You can tap on each artist 's entry to see songs on your device , then tap a song to play it . By default Amazon MP3 streams your music , which can rack up large data bills . To make music available offline , long-press on an artist , then choose 'Download all songs by artist ' . You can also tap the orange download icon to put the music on your device . It 's also a good idea to set Amazon MP3 to only download music over Wi-Fi - this means it wo n't attempt to download music when you 're on a mobile data connection . Tap the menu icon , then 'Settings ' and check 'Download only on Wi-Fi ' . You can also set 'Automatic downloads ' here , so new music is imported immediately . You should now be able to access some of your favourite songs via your Android device , and you know how to add music from your computer to the Amazon cloud . Do n't forget that you can buy music via the Amazon MP3 app , too , and anything that you purchase is automatically added to the cloud

Amazon has joined the likes of Google , Dropbox and Facebook by offering automatic photo uploads through its Cloud Drive Photos app for Android . Users of the retailer 's online storage locker can use the Android app to back-up photos , the moment they 're taken on a smartphone or tablet . The app offers 5GB of free storage so there 's plenty of space for your prized smartphone snaps , which can be uploaded over Wi-Fi and 3G . The new update mimics the functionality offered by the rival Dropbox storage solution , while Google+ Instant Upload and Facebook Photo Sync also upload photos to private folders on their networks , making sharing easier . The Cloud Drive Photos app was launched in November with the aim of making it easier to safely stow snaps online . At that time there was no automatic upload feature . Alongside the auto-upload functionality , Cloud Drive Photos now also features a built-in camera interface , meaning it can replace the Camera and Gallery apps on your Android phone if you 're so inclined . There 's still no sign of the app for iOS devices , although they can access the main Cloud Drive apps .

Amazon will develop a TV show adaptation of the hit movie Zombieland for its Prime Instant Video service , it was reported on Monday . Like its big rival Netflix , Amazon is seeking to supplement its on-demand offerings of archive movies and TV shows with original programming . Netflix is currently miles ahead in that game with the likes of Lilyhammer and the forthcoming House Of Cards and new episodes of Arrested Development , but it looks like Amazon has now landed a noteworthy show of its own . BroadcastNow reports that the adaptation of Zombieland , which starred Woody Harrelson and Jessie Eissenberg in the post-apocalyptic full-length comedy , was scheduled to air on the CBS network before Amazon picked it up . The report suggests that the half-hour episodes will feature the members of the original un-dead slaying crew , but it 's likely to be a while before the show goes into production , let alone appears on Instant Video . While the news mainly pertains to Amazon 's US-only on-demand service , it is possible that the company could also screen Zombieland through its UK-based Lovefilm service . Last last year Amazon picked up six comedy projects that will air as pilots through Prime and Lovefilm . Viewers will get to vote on which they like best , and that show will be commissioned for a full season . Via BroadcastNow

Amazon discovered a loophole that allows iPhone and iPod touch users to buy and download music from Amazon 's MP3 store without dealing with iTunes . Thursday , the company launched a redesign for the Amazon MP3 store that is optimized for iOS Safari browsers . With the new web store users can purchase music directly from their iPhone or iPod touch browser , which is then stored in their Amazon Cloud Player account . In order to actually listen to the tunes , users will need to download the Amazon Cloud Player app , which can either play music directly from the cloud or download music for offline playback . The newly optimized Amazon MP3 store is good news for iOS users , providing access to Amazon 's music catalog of 22 million songs , as well as frequent sales . Of course , Amazon could have simply allowed song purchases through the Amazon Cloud Player app and saved users an extra step , similar to the Android version of Amazon 's app . However , if Amazon were to sell music through its native iOS app , then it would owe Apple a 30 percent cut of each song purchase . No such fee exists for purchases on a website though , making the web-based MP3 store a convenient loophole for Amazon to still reach the iOS market . The catch is that users will have to split their music library between Apple 's own Music app and the Amazon Cloud Player , which is really what Amazon is going for . The more devices that can buy and play from Amazon 's music catalog the better off it is , and even more so if Amazon can avoid fees along the way .

Before Apple and Amazon battle it out in the courtroom over an app store name trademark dispute , the companies will have to sit down and talk about it like grown-ups first . U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte on Monday ordered the two into settlement talks to attempt to resolve the dispute before the trademark trial gets underway Aug. 19 . The meeting is to take place March 21 , with executives and lawyers present to negotiate the matter . Both parties will have to make a good faith effort to resolve the case , according to the order by Laporte : `` No participant in the settlement conference will be permitted to leave the settlement conference before it is concluded , '' the order read . But just because the two were ordered to try and hash out some kind of deal does n't mean the suit must be resolved in the conference . So we may yet see this trademark dispute go to trial . When Amazon launched its Android Appstore back in March 2011 , Apple was none too happy about the online retailer 's name choice . That was evident by the lawsuit the Cupertino-company handed Amazon . Apple said Amazon 's Appstore was too close to its own App Store name , confusing customers . `` Consumers of mobile software downloads are likely to be confused as to whether Amazon 's mobile software download service is sponsored or approved by Apple or is merely a conduit for Apple 's APP STORE service , '' Apple wrote in its 2011 complaint against Amazon . Along with the trademark infringement case , Apple also accused Amazon of false advertising . But just last week , a U.S. District Court threw out those allegations . That was only the first battle of this trademark war , and the ruling will reportedly have no effect on the outcome of the infringement suit . Apple still has five more pending claims against Amazon : those claims include unfair competition along with the trademark infringement . The two tech giants may resolve this particular trademark situation in the court mandated meeting . But breath holding is n't recommended , and not only because the meeting is still two months away . We 'll let you know if the two companies have anything to say on the matter , and if the companies respond to TechRadar 's request for comment . Via AllThingD

Amazon has just unveiled a new feature called AutoRip , which grants customers free MP3 version of CDs they buy from Amazon . It 's perhaps intended to lure people back to buying CDs and cut out the pesky iTunes middleman by removing the need for the disc to ever see the inside of your computer . The MP3 versions are stored in your Amazon Cloud Player online and can be accessed from a computer , your smartphone , your tablet or whatever else you may have hacked to play MP3s . The other obvious benefit is that you can buy a physical CD and start listening to the music straight away , without having to wait two to five working days for it to arrive . Any eligible CDs you 've bought on Amazon since 1998 will also be automatically added to your digital locker too - and with 37,499 eligible AutoRip albums currently on Amazon.com , you should be left with a fairly sizeable online collection . We 're waiting for official word from Amazon but it looks as though the AutoRip feature is only available on Amazon.com so far - we 'll let you know if it 's going global when we hear back from the retailer .

Amazon and Apple have been battling it out in court over Amazon 's Appstore for Android for almost 19 months . Apple accused Amazon not just of trademark infringement for using the words `` app '' and `` store '' together , but also pointed the finger at the retailer for false advertising . On Wednesday , the case took a turn in Amazon 's favor when the United States District Court dismissed Apple 's claims of false advertising . In the ruling , Apple 's claims were put to pasture as the court found `` the mere use of 'Appstore ' ... can not be construed as a representation that the nature , characteristics or quality of the Amazon Appstore is the same as that of the Apple App Store . '' This move came just three months after Amazon filed a request to have the false advertising claim thrown out , with the online retailer going so far as to cite Apple executives Steve Jobs and Tim Cook as part of its defense . Despite this minor setback in Apple 's case against Amazon , this ruling will reportedly have no effect on the outcome of the ongoing trademark infringement suit . Apple has had a registered trademark for the App Store with the United States Patent and Trademark Office since 2008 , and had requested Amazon cease using the Appstore name while it was still in development . Prior to Apple 's litigation with Amazon , the Cupertino-based company engaged in similar legal maneuvering with Microsoft over the same terms . Microsoft 's court proceedings with Apple were put on suspension pending the outcome of Amazon 's case , which shows no sign of ending any time soon . Though Amazon was dealt a small victory here , the war is far from over , as there are still five more claims the court must deal with in regards to the alleged trademark issues . Apple is no stranger to lengthy legal battles , and it will be interesting to see just how this latest case progresses not just for Amazon , but for Microsoft 's interests as well . Via The Verge

Amazon has released an iPad app for use with its Cloud Player online music storage service . The service , which launched last year , allows users to store their music collections online and either play them directly from the cloud or download for offline play .

Apple has lost its place as the most trusted company in the US , with Amazon edging it out , according to an online survey of 14,000 people . Are consumers tiring of the Cupertino company , just as it 's gearing up to launch into new product areas , including TVs and even watches ? Apple topped last year 's Harris Interactive Reputational Quotient survey , with Google in second place and Amazon in fourth . But this year Amazon is top , with Apple dropping to second , and Google now fourth . Other tech companies in the list include Microsoft at 15 , and Facebook , which makes its debut at number 42 . Last year , Apple notched up the survey 's highest ever score , but has dropped three points this year . According to Robert Fronk from Harris Interactive , Apple 's drop is down to its falling stock price . `` For a number of years , [ Apple 's ] reputation was driven by their innovation , their products and services almost being ahead of their time and almost driving the market , '' Fronk told Yahoo ! Finance . `` Now , actually , financial performance is a dominant driver of their reputation and of course financial performance can be somewhat out of your control , as they 're finding . '' Fronk said Amazon 's rise was due to its varied selection of products and services , but it also to the way it uses customer data : `` They use that information to create the right level of intimacy with you , but without going over that fine line of being intrusive . Perceptions are that they 're not giving that information to anyone else to monetize it . '' Via The Verge

Amazon will launch its own currency in May , known as Amazon Coins . Exclusively for use with Amazon 's Kindle Fire range of tablets , the currency will let you buy apps , games and in-app purchases . Like all currencies companies invent , it 's hard to see much of a boon to us consumers . In theory it makes it easier to buy from Amazon , but with one-click purchases already present and correct , how much easier can it get ? Instead , Coins is aimed at increasing profits for Amazon , as well as anyone selling apps and games through it . When it launches in the US in May , Amazon will dish out tens of millions of dollars ' worth of Amazon Coins for free , helping spread awareness of the new currency as well as stimulating sales . Amazon does n't make a profit from its tablets and e-book readers , thanks to their low prices , so relies on big sales of e-books , films , music and games from its online store . Hence it 's hardly surprising it wants to find new ways for us to spend . `` Developers continue to report higher conversion rates on Amazon compared to other platforms , '' Paul Ryder , Amazon 's Vice President of Apps and Games , said in a statement . `` Now we have another new way to help developers reach even more of our millions of customers . '' Developers will still make 70 per cent from each sale using Amazon Coins . Only apps and games approved before April 25 will be eligible for purchase using the currency . Via Amazon

It 's been a busy old week in tech : we 've seen some record-breaking new kit , discovered some worrying new trends and said hello to an old favourite we thought we 'd lost forever . Kit first : fancy the world 's fastest graphics card ? AMD reckons it has just that in the form of the Radeon HD 7990 , a card so powerful it can open a portal into another dimension . That was n't the only good news for gamers at this year 's GDC conference , though : we saw new screens from GTA5 , the new Android-powered GameStick console and the news that Mozilla and Epic Games want to bring console-quality games to web browsers . What we did n't see , though , was the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox 720 . Sony did offer more details on its upcoming console and showed off the latest DualShock controller , but the console itself remains a mystery - as does the Xbox 720 , which we think Microsoft will reveal in the next few weeks . We 're hoping for a big reveal from Amazon soon too : the rumours of an Amazon phone are swirling , with the latest reports suggesting a 4.7-inch display and a mid-2013 release . We 'd expect it to be rather like a Kindle Fire : affordable and tied tightly into Amazon 's various offerings . While it 's unclear whether Amazon 's phone actually exists , Microsoft 's much-discussed Windows Blue is definitely real - and it should appear at June 's Build conference . Sadly Windows Blue wo n't be the official name , but the rest of the news is good : there 's improved Skydrive integration , new apps and better personalisation options . It 's coming to phones too , which should be fun . Could the era of free online news be coming to an end ? It certainly looks that way : the Telegraph is putting up a paywall and so is the Sun - although in the latter case it 's part of a package that also includes Premier League football clips . `` It 's no longer scaremongering to suggest that we are heading towards a two-tier internet - one premium rate service and a second class ad-funded proletarian section - because it 's already happening , '' says Patrick Goss . Bundles are where we 're heading : `` Imagine if your Netflix subscription also bagged you Spotify Premium , free Wi-Fi in coffee shops and 10 free hours of Now TV or 1TB of cloud storage and free use of Office 365 . '' The trouble with tech is that it often causes problems for traditional businesses , such as shops . One Australian shopkeeper is so annoyed by showroomers - people browsing her shop then ordering the products online - that she 's imposed a $ 5 fee for browsing . For Gary Marshall , it 's the latest in a long string of terrible ideas from retailers . `` There 's no doubt that it 's tough out there , and of course every retail job loss is a tragedy for the people put out of work , '' he says , `` but it 'd help if some businesses ' strategy for combating the internet threat was n't 'deliver the most miserable shopping experience imaginable ' . `` We ca n't uninvent the internet or online shopping , and `` that means retailers face the same choices major music companies faced in the early 2000s : come up with something different and better , or watch the tech firms take over . '' That brings us nicely to Jessops , the much-loved UK photographic chain that hit the skids earlier this year . It 's back ! Back ! BACK ! The first six stores open this week , with a further 30 opening in April , and it sounds like they 're getting an Apple-inspired revamp . The new-look Jessops will also offer product hands-ons and in-store photography courses . Best of all , Jessops will be hiring back many former employees . We wish it , and them , the very best .

Kindle devices will soon be infused with book recommendations from the world 's largest community of reading enthusiasts after Amazon agreed to buy the popular Goodreads website and mobile apps . Established in 2007 , the preeminent social network for readers has racked up 16 million members , who 've shared 23 million book reviews , from an overall database of 525 million titles . Goodreads users can see which books their friends are reading , see recommendations tailored to their own tastes and also track which titles they have read and rated using the service . In a statement , Amazon said it will work with the Goodreads team to `` delight readers , '' while the Goodreads ' CEO spoke of the opportunity to enlighten more readers with informed recommendations . `` Amazon and Goodreads share a passion for reinventing reading , '' said Russ Grandinetti Amazon Vice President , Kindle Content . `` Goodreads has helped change how we discover and discuss books and , with Kindle , Amazon has helped expand reading around the world . In addition , both Amazon and Goodreads have helped thousands of authors reach a wider audience and make a better living at their craft . Together we intend to build many new ways to delight readers and authors alike . '' Otis Chandler , Goodreads CEO , who 's company will continue to operate out of its San Francsico offices , added : `` People love to talk about ideas and share their passion for the stories they read . I 'm incredibly excited about the opportunity to partner with Amazon and Kindle . We 're now going to be able to move faster in bringing the Goodreads experience to millions of readers around the world . We 're looking forward to inspiring greater literary discussion and helping more readers find great books , whether they read in print or digitally . '' The deal is expected to be rubber stamped sometime in the second quarter of 2013 . The fee Amazon will pay for the site has not been disclosed . It remains to be seen how Amazon will implement the Goodreads platform into its existing and vast reviews and recommendations database . It seems unlikely too much will change for Goodreads users in terms of how they use the service . Amazon , at least until now , is n't known for running roughshod over popular commodities they come to acquire . TechRadar has reached out to Amazon and Goodreads for further comment and will update this story when a response is forthcoming . == UPDATE : In a blog post on the Goodreads website , CEO Otis Chandler moved to assure the community that the site `` is n't going anywhere . '' and that Kindle integration is a long-requested feature from users . He wrote : `` It 's important to be clear that Goodreads and the awesome team behind it are not going away . Goodreads will continue to be the wonderful community that we all cherish . We plan to continue offering you everything that you love about the site—the ability to track what you read , discover great books , discuss and share them with fellow book lovers , and connect directly with your favorite authors—and your reviews and ratings will remain here on Goodreads . And it 's incredibly important to us that we remain a home for all types of readers , no matter if you read on paper , audio , digitally , from scrolls , or even stone tablets . `` For all of you Kindle readers , there 's obviously an extra bonus in this announcement . You 've asked us for a long time to be able to integrate your Kindle and Goodreads experiences . Making that option a reality is one of our top priorities . ''

Amazon Kindle ereaders may one day be as thin as the paper they replaced , if the company follows through on the intriguing plans outlined in a recent patent filing . The retailer and digital content champion has brainstormed a super-slim and light Kindle that would not require a battery , a processing unit or local storage to be built into the body . Instead , the device would simply communicate with a remote basestation that would transmit power and data to the display , offering a `` substantially longer '' lifespan than on a rechargeable battery . The patent , uncovered by GeekWire , lists company CEO Jeff Bezos as co-inventor and explains how voice commands and gestures , like turning a page , could be registered by the display and sent to the station . In one possible application for the technology , the company explains the benefits of placing multiple basestations around a college campus and equipping students with displays . It would allow those going from class-to-class to use the display all day without worrying about charging the battery , not to mention condemning the paper textbook once and for all . Beyond the Kindle , the patent also details how the portable display technology could be used within the windshield of an automobile and a user 's glasses to enable a Google Glass-like experience . Do you think Amazon will be pushing this tech as its next big ebook innovation ? What happens when users are out of range of the basestation ? Let us know in the comments section below . Via T3

What does Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos do in his spare time ? Recover F-1 engines belonging to Apollo 11 from 14,000 feet below the ocean 's surface , of course . Apollo 11 , as you surely know , was the mission that landed Neil Armstrong on the moon . Thanks to Bezos ' `` Bezos Expeditions '' website , we 're able to follow along with what 's clearly an intense area of interest for the tech head - he remembers watching Apollo 11 blast off at 5 years old and credits it as one of the primary reasons he 's passionate about science , engineering and exploration . The billionaire financed the expedition , taking place off the coast of Cape Canaveral , and the group successfully recovered enough parts to cobble together displays for two engines . While Bezos ' hobby is less eccentric than many a wealthy person , we 're feeling a little jealous : Our spring breaks were never nearly this historically significant . Blips are TechRadar 's new news nuggets that you 'll find percolating through the homepage - or you can see them all by hitting the blip keyword below .

Update : As well as a $ 99 Kindle Fire HD 7-inch would sell , it looks like that price point may not be in the cards for Amazon any time soon . Business Insider retained a statement from an Amazon spokesperson who said , `` It 's not happening - we are already at the lowest price points possible for that hardware . '' The operative word here may be `` that '' as the spokesperson could have been leaving room for a $ 99 regular Kindle Fire or other unknown piece of hardware . We 'll just have to wait to see if Amazon gets a little more talky down the road . Original article ... Amazon may be planning to release a cheaper Kindle Fire HD 7-inch before the year is out . The word comes from TechCrunch , whose mysterious sources say that the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD will come with a price tag of $ 99 ( around £60 , AU $ 95 ) . They add that the tablet will come with a TI processor similar to the rest of the Fire family , as well as the 1280x800 resolution already on the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD . The current 7-inch Kindle Fire HD sells for £159 in the UK and $ 199 in the US , so it 'll be a fairly significant price drop if these rumours turn out to be true . It may seem a little too significant a drop to possibly be real , but Amazon has a habit of selling its tech hardware at a loss and scooping up the difference by selling ebooks , films , music and apps through its mutated Android software once you 've got it home . It 'll face some hefty competition though ; many will be inclined to shell out a little more for the iPad mini , while others will go for the cleaner Android running on Google 's Nexus 7 , itself rumoured to be getting a reasonably-priced HD edition later this year too .

Amazon Prime members may not be part of very exclusive club in the future , but that might not matter much because the two-day shipping service could be cheaper or even free one day . The reason behind this is Prime members are more likely to use Amazon as their go-to store thanks to the benefits of convenience of fast shipping and the ability to stream movies . On average , Amazon Prime members spend twice as much as regular customers annually , according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners ' ( CIRP ) calculations picked up by Wired . Breaking it down even further , Prime members account for $ 78 ( around UK£52 , AU $ 76 ) more in profit when you subtract Amazon 's shipping and video streaming expenses , said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy . That 's pretty much the cost of an Amazon Prime membership , which is $ 79 per year for everyone who ca n't get the student discount . Growing from 7 million to 10 million members in the 2012 fiscal year , Amazon Prime has `` hit on a means of creating some very , very valuable customers , '' said CIRP partner Michael Levin . `` They 're starting to encroach on the territory of general merchants and grocery stores , '' said Hottovy . `` I think that 's the next frontier . '' Sure enough , Amazon is using deals like Subscribe & Save to deliver everyday items like food and household products to customers on a routine basis . The retailer even has a deal in which customers can receive a 15 percent discount on their Subscribe & Save orders when five or more items are ordered within one month . The pace at which Amazon Prime has been growing could continue , with the analysts predicting that the total number of memberships could reach 25 million by 2017 . By then , as the online retailer adjusts its strategy for customer loyalty , Amazon Prime could cost very little or absolutely nothing .

Amazon is hoping to buy the right to use .book as a domain but authors ' groups and publishing industry types are fiercely opposed to the plan . ICANN , the industry body that oversees internet domains , is auctioning off a whole raft of new domain suffixes including .lol and .book . As a major book retailer , not to mention a seller of ebook readers and ebooks , Amazon has its eye on .book ( think Amazon.book and Kindle.book ) , as well as .author and .read . But publishing bodies say these domains would give Amazon an anti-competitive edge . Scott Turow , president of the US Authors Guild , put his objections to ICANN , saying , `` We strongly object to ICANN 's plans to sell the exclusive top-level domain rights for generic book-industry terms , such as .book , .author and .read . `` Placing such generic domains in private hands is plainly anticompetitive , allowing already dominant , well-capitalised companies to expand and entrench their market power . The potential for abuse seems limitless . `` ICANN , of all entities , should be mindful of the critical need to maintain an open , freely competitive internet , '' he concluded . Unsurprisingly , some of Amazon 's competitors are also vocally opposed to the bid , including Barnes & Noble .

Amazon Prime subscribers love their free two-day shipping , but Google may show up the e-tailer with a less expensive service offering same-day delivery from brick-and-mortar retailers . TechCrunch reported this week that Google may quietly launch a new e-commerce initiative known as Google Shopping Express . According to sources , the same-day delivery service would undercut Amazon 's popular $ 79 per year Prime offering , which gives subscribers free two-day shipping on almost everything the e-tailer sells . Reportedly led by Tom Fallows , Google e-commerce product manager , Shopping Express is being positioned as $ 10 to $ 15 less expensive than Amazon Prime , with same-day delivery from select retailers . Priced at $ 64 or $ 69 per year , Google Shopping Express would deliver products the same day they are ordered from brick-and-mortar retailers such as Target , Walmart , Walgreens and Safeway . Amazon has also been testing new ways to deliver goods purchased online , an idea Google appears to want a piece of as well , judging from its recent acquisition of BufferBox . Currently available only in Canada , BufferBox offers consumers a central , convenient place to pick up packages at any time of day , although it 's unclear how Google might implement the service into Shopping Express , if at all . When asked , a Google spokesperson was unsurprisingly reticent to give too much away : `` We are always working to build a delightful shopping experience for users , in close partnership with retailers , and to empower businesses of all sizes to compete effectively . `` We will continue to work toward providing technology , tools and traffic to help power the retail ecosystem but have nothing to announce at this time . '' Shopping Express , if it every happens , could be a big boost for Google Wallet and Google Shopping , Mountain View 's existing e-commerce offerings which have largely floundered , despite being tied into the company 's core search engine service .

First , there was the race to capitalize on the growing tablet market with devices like the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD . Then there were rumblings Amazon may soon be entering the rapidly expanding smartphone arena with a branded device all its own . Now , reports indicate Amazon is about to make a foray into the living room , right beneath your HD television . According to sources close to the project speaking with Business Week , Amazon is no longer content to just have its instant video service appear as an app on other products , and is developing a proprietary set-top box all its own . Supposedly on track to arrive this fall , Amazon 's streaming media box will provide access to the online retail giant 's library of instant video and video on-demand options . Amazon Instant Video is already available on a wide variety of similar devices , including gaming consoles like the PlayStation 3 . With this new set-top box though , Amazon hopes to differentiate itself from competitors like Apple TV and Roku with the easy instant access having an Amazon Prime membership would provide . The device is purportedly being developed by Amazon 's Lab126 in Cupertino , Calif. , which has apparently worked on similar devices before , though those never met the public . It will be interesting to see if Amazon allows other services like Netflix and Hulu to appear on its streaming system , if it 's indeed in the works , as those apps are readily available on Kindle devices . Competitive devices like Apple TV do allow for secondary apps like Netflix to exist in the same ecosystem , so it may not be to Amazon 's advantage to shut out those services . TechRadar asked Amazon for comment , though we 're not holding our breath for a response with any concrete details about the company 's plans . Maybe we offer a product name ? We 're thinking Kindle-vision has a nice ring .

With the Kindle Fire HD selling like hotcakes and rumours of an Amazon smartphone getting louder and louder , the online retailer has decided to throw more fuel on the fire of speculation by opening its App Store to an additional 200 markets around the world . Previously only available in the US , UK , Germany , France , Italy , Japan and Spain , the App Store will roll out over the coming months to a large number of additional countries , including Australia , Brazil , Canada , Mexico , India , South Africa and South Korea . The Amazon app store , with more than 50,000 apps , will be available to download to a wide number of Android devices , offering Android users an alternative source of apps to buy on their device . Developers can now dictate which countries they wish their app to appear in , while international developers can also begin enjoying the new global reach of the Amazon ecosystem . The last time that Amazon expanded its App Store access back in 2011 from the US-only to include the UK and European countries , it was a precursor to international availability of the Kindle Fire overseas . The Amazon App Store was made available in the UK and Europe in the middle of last year , just months before the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD went on sale in October . Whether this global expansion is planned for the current range of Fire tablets or a new breed of Amazon smartphone is pure speculation , but it 's unlikely that Amazon does n't have a strategy to expand its hardware footprint outside of the US and Europe .

Amazon has played in the e-reader space for what seems like ages , leaving the smartphone work to others as it carved out its own niche market . That 's not to say an Amazon phone has n't been rumored , however . In fact , more evidence is amassing that the company wants to get on the same field as the likes of Apple and Samsung , with a new revelation today adding more fuel to the Amazonian phone fire . According to sources speaking with TechCrunch , the company quietly purchased digital assistant app Evi for $ 26 million ( around UK£17 million , AU $ 25 million ) sometime late last year . Available on Android and iOS , Evi is a very Siri-like service made by UK-based True Knowledge . She 's one smart cookie , with the app 's inventor saying Evi can process almost 1 billion facts while tapping into a `` huge base of the world 's knowledge in a form that she can understand and reason with . '' She even `` learns '' as she goes . Though the sale of Evi is unconfirmed by all parties involved , bunches of clues point to the deal being done . Among those is that at the UK Companies House , which oversees company registrations , all Evi Technologies Ltd directors were reportedly replaced by Amazon 's UK legal rep. Mitre Secretaris Ltd is the corporate secretary for Amazon.co.uk and it 's now also apparently the Company Secretary for Evi Technologies . Twisted . But in terms of what Amazon would want with this voice and text recognizing personal assistant , there are a few options , with most pointing to a mobile device . One is that the online retailer is looking to boost its Kindle Fire offerings with a Siri-ous companion . In the face of competition from the iPad , iPad mini and Android and Windows 8-based tablets , an intelligent assistant like Evi might give the Kindle an extra edge . If she can give good book recommendations , she 's a winner . Or perhaps Amazon is laying the groundwork for the introduction of its very own phone , one we would n't be surprised is based on Android but features its own homegrown features , like Evi . Maybe Evi will join sister software Ivona , which Amazon picked up in January , to create the uber-assistant ? Nothing is for sure , but the Amazon phone is sounding increasingly like a foregone conclusion .

Former Windows Phone General Manager Charlie Kindel revealed that Amazon , the company that sells the Kindle , brought him onboard today , which sounded like yet another April Fools ' prank . However , the only April 1-related joke was that he and the company were making a home server product called the `` Amazon Kindle Charlie . '' The home server is fictitious , but the experience that Kindel can bring to the online retailer is not . At Microsoft , he was the driving force behind Windows Home Server and the Windows Phone 7 application platform and developer experience . `` Depending on your perspective you can either blame me or thank me for a large part of ActiveX , '' Kindel lightheartedly stated on his Google+ profile . Although Kindel was in the joking mood about his move to Amazon , he was serious about keeping his future plans at the company top-secret . `` I 'm building a new team going after a totally new area for Amazon . I 'm hiring cloud and mobile developers and testers , program managers , and product managers , '' he wrote on his LinkedIn profile , according to GeekWire . He described the role as the director of `` something secret . '' That `` something secret '' could be the long-rumored Amazon smartphone , which has been reportedly delayed until later this year . This theory is backed up by Kindel 's strong Windows Phone experience and the fact that his new job will focus on something new with `` ginormous potential . '' `` Amazon presented an opportunity to build something new that has ginormous potential . I simply could n't pass the opportunity up , '' he said . `` As a double bonus , the idea that I can work in such a principled and customer focused company is really exciting to me . '' For now , the only other information Kindel is revealing about his day-to-day duties at the company came from a follow-up tweet . `` First task of Amazon new hire training : Remove laptop stickers , '' he wrote on Twitter , followed by a photo of a half-peeled Windows computer sticker belonging to none other than his former employer .

All Samsung 's e-ink companies are belong to Amazon now , as the retail giant has taken Liquavista off Samsung 's hands . Word that the sale was on the cards first surfaced in March , at which point Samsung did little to deny that the two companies were in talks . Amazon says that it `` may be able to incorporate '' Liquavista 's colour e-ink technologies into future products `` over the long term '' , which suggests that a colour e-ink Kindle may be on the way but certainly is n't imminent . `` The Liquavista team shares our passion for invention and is creating exciting new technologies with a lot of potential , '' the Amazon spokesperson added . `` It 's still early days , but we 're excited about the possibilities and we look forward to working with Liquavista to develop these displays . '' Now join us over at the speculation station : Amazon may already have colour tablets on the market in the form of the Kindle Fire range , but a colour e-ink ereader , with its similarities to reading from the page , could be just the thing to persuade the last remaining print-loving luddites that digital reading is n't the devil 's own game . What 's more , with colours and a touchscreen in the mix , some simple apps could even hit the ereaders too - after all , what people really need are more distractions when they 're trying to read .

Amazon has kicked off its new virtual currency – the excitingly-named Amazon Coins – to US customers today . To get things rolling , Amazon is depositing $ 5 ( around £3.25 / AUS $ 5 ) worth of Coins into the account of every Kindle Fire owner , which amounts to about 500 of the imaginary tokens . This is the `` tens of millions of dollars '' that Amazon promised when the currency was first announced in February . Amazon Coins are basically credits that you can use to buy apps on the Amazon Appstore as well as make some in-app purchases , with a 10 per cent discount on coins when bought in bulk . Meanwhile , app developers will still get 70 per cent of the money when customers buy with Amazon Coins and Amazon hopes the customer incentives will bring more developers on board . As a virtual currency , this is more comparable to the likes of Microsoft Points than something more self-contained such as Bitcoin . It 's a big shame that these coins are totally virtual – the design is really cool . `` We will continue to add more ways to earn and spend Coins on a wider range of content and activities – today is Day One for Coins , '' said Amazon in a statement . So that 's the US sorted - but what about everyone else ? We 've asked Amazon about its plans for a global rollout as we 'd be very surprised if one was n't coming soon . We 'll update you as soon as we know more .

Apple then iOS , iOS then Android . There can often be a one-followed-by-the-other roll out to apps between the two major OSes ( we wo n't mention Windows Phone 8 or others in this case ) , and Amazon followed form this week as it launched Cloud Drive Photos app for iOS . This follows the app 's November 2012 release on Android , and now gives iDevice users their option to store their snapshots somewhere other than their phone . Users will get 5GB of storage for free , with extra space starting at $ 10/year ( around UK£6 , AU $ 9.99 ) for 20GB . Pics taken with an iPhone or iPod touch are saved to Cloud Drive automatically when the app is running , and photos are accessible from either device , computer or any web browser , noted PC Mag . One note for expectant users : Users must have iOS 6 or higher to use the app . Android , iOS , Windows Phone 8 , Symbian . It does n't matter what OS you use ; our news blips are for everyone .

You know the story : Amazon is supposedly working on a smartphone , a phantasmal device that surfaces then descends to the depths with every hardware-related move the e-tailer takes . Today , however , we may have our most solid evidence yet that Amazon is indeed developing not one , but two smartphones , including a handset with 3D viewing capabilities . The company is also said to be working on an audio-only streaming device . All this information is courtesy of the Wall Street Journal , which has it on the authority of people `` familiar with the company 's plans '' that Amazon 's hardware ambitions may be broader than anyone suspected . According to the publication , the company 's Lab126 facility in Cupertino , Calif. is abuzz with the Alphabet Projects , the collective name for devices being developed under the individual code names of Project A , B , C and D . While we do n't know which is which , a report from last month suggested Amazon is developing a set-top box . This could be the fourth prong in the Alphabet Projects equation , according to the Journal 's sources . But back to today 's news - one of the smartphones is described as a high-end device complete with a screen that allows for 3D image projection sans glasses . Through retina-tracking tech , the images will appear to float above the screen - much like a hologram - and appear in 3D from all angles . Two of the WSJ 's sources said people may be able to navigate content using only their eyes . None of these projects may see the public light of day , and bringing them to life hinges on performance , financial or `` other concerns , '' but the chance that they are indeed in development makes our ears perk up quite a bit . We 'll keep you posted on any and all Amazon hardware developments , but until we hear more , check out our Amazon phone round-up page .

Amazon may have just accidentally spilled the beans on the Acer Iconia W3 , an unannounced tablet that was previously rumored to be the first 8-inch Windows 8 device . The Iconia W3 appeared briefly today on Amazon.com under a listing titled `` Acer Computer W3-810-1600 8.1-inch 32GB Tablet ( Silver ) . '' Interestingly , the Iconia W3 was listed on Amazon with a price of $ 379.99 ( around UK£244 , AU $ 368 ) ; this is the first we 've heard of the tablet 's cost . The Amazon link now leads to a `` document not found '' filler page , but Engadget managed to snap a screenshot , which you can see above . The photo of Acer 's Iconia W3 that was posted with its Amazon listing today is n't new ; it first appeared with a slew of other images when the existence of the new Windows 8 tablet was rumored last month . That rumor claimed that the Iconia W3 would come with a 1.8GHz dual-core Atom Z2760 processor , 2GB of RAM , and two cameras . The listing backed those stats up and also mentioned a resolution of 1280 x 800 , integrated graphics at 64MB of memory , two megapixels for each cameras and a two-cell 3,500mAh battery that can last up to eight hours . Granted , the page also said elsewhere that the Acer Iconia W3 will pack a 1.5GHz Apple A4 processor , which is clearly incorrect , so the rest of those specs could well be off too . The Iconia W3 's release date was initially estimated around mid-August , or by the time schools are back in session . Today 's Amazon listing provided no hints as to dates , saying only that the 8-inch tablet was `` temporarily out of stock . '' We asked Acer to comment on the leak but a spokesperson for the Taiwanese company informed us that they had nothing to add .

Twitter 's Vine video app has graduated to a new platform this weekend and is now available to download from the Amazon app store for Kindle Fire tablets . The app , which allows users to create and upload short , 6-second video clips , had only been available on Apple 's iPhone or Android smartphones . Vine 's arrival on Kindle Fire is the first time the app has been optimised specifically for a tablet device . The decision to launch on the Kindle Fire is somewhat surprising considering the questionable quality of the device 's front-facing camera and the lack of any rear-facing camera . There 's also no Vine app for Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 at this time . Vine 's expansion comes following new competition from Facebook-owned Instagram , which rolled out its own short video feature earlier this month . Reports this week had suggested uploads to Vine had taken a hit as a result of Instagram 's encroachment on its reason for being . To combat the new rival , Twitter updated the Vine Android app earlier this week to include support for the front-facing camera , bringing it in line with the iOS app . Via The Verge

Update : Despite what is a milestone day for Ouya , there 's a shadow cast over its accomplishment of making it to retail . `` Well it is the 25th of June and I still have not received my Ouya . What a shame , '' wrote one backer on Kickstarter , spelling out the plight of what is apparently the case for thousands of the company 's pre-order customers . `` As each day ticks by I regret backing this project more and more . '' Notes posted on Facebook by CEO Julie Uhrman and Head of Operations Ken Stephens indicate the issue in getting consoles out to early backers is due to a hold up at its Hong Kong fulfillment partner . Ouya is manufactured in China . All units have left Hong Kong , Stephens wrote , and he estimated it would take between 15 and 17 days to arrive at customers ' doorsteps . The issue is affecting mostly international backers , he wrote . Contacting the company for answers is also proving difficult for many , according to comments . We 're also waiting from an official response from the company . Original article ... Successfully making the transition from Kickstarter mythology to retail product , the Android-based Ouya gaming console is now available across North America and the U.K. - in theory , anyway . The company announced today that its Kickstarter-funded project is now available at retail stores across the United States , Canada and United Kingdom , priced to move at $ 99.99 ( UK£99.99 ) . Retail launch partners include Amazon , Best Buy , GAME , GameStop and Target , which began stocking shelves with the 3-inch brushed aluminum cubes after being delayed in early May for additional funding . Pre-release models of the Ouya were met with mixed reviews , though the company assured it put in the work to improve the console 's software . In fact , we noticed that the console has improved input lag time , something we experienced when we first tested the machine in our hands on review . With more than 170 new games and 17,000 registered game developers , the Ouya has come far from its crowd-funded roots . `` It 's incredible to think that a little under a year ago Ouya was just an idea - we wanted to do something completely new in console gaming : build a $ 99 game console , with no discs to buy , open to all developers , and affordable to all gamers , '' Ouya Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Julie Uhrman remarked Tuesday . Unfortunately , eager gamers may want to call before heading to stores : According to Joystiq , Ouya is already temporarily out of stock at e-tailer Amazon , although our local Best Buy showed stock available at press time . In addition to Ouya 's gaming chops , the console also includes streaming video and music apps from Twitch.tv , Plex , XBMC , iHeartRadio and others complete with surround sound and 1080pHD graphics .

It 's not us ! It 's Amazon ! They 're the ones you want ! - comes the cry from the Apple camp in the wake of Judge Cote 's decision that Cook and co are guilty of fixing ebook prices . A statement from Cupertino states Apple 's intention to appeal the ruling , adding that Amazon is the real villain of the piece . Apple spokesman Tom Neumary said in a statement , `` Apple did not conspire to fix ebook pricing and we will continue to fight these false accusations . `` When we introduced iBookstore in 2010 , we gave customers more choice , injecting much needed innovation and competition into the market , breaking Amazon 's monopolistic grip on the publishing industry . `` We 've done nothing wrong and will appeal the judge 's decision . '' Apple 's impassioned statement , which we ca n't help but imagine being read out accompanied by an indignant stamp of the foot , comes shortly after it was revealed that Judge Cote ruled to the contrary . The Department of Justice 's assistant attorney general Bill Baer described the ruling as `` a victory for millions of consumers who choose to read books electronically '' . Judge Cote 's ruling conceded that publishers were complicit in the price fixing skulduggery , but added that `` compelling evidence '' indicated that `` without Apple 's orchestration of this conspiracy , it would not have succeeded as it did '' .

Poor old Adobe Flash . After years of providing access to online video , along came HTML5 with its fancy , non-buggy , mobile-friendly software and it was `` au revoir '' without so much as a handshake . However , despite Apple ditching the platform and Adobe halting support for Flash on mobile devices , many video providers have n't made the transition , making it tough to access content without a workaround . Amazon is looking to fill that void with its affordable Kindle Fire tablets by testing an `` experimental streaming viewer '' that allows flash content to be played through the device 's Silk browser . AllThingsD brings word that the company is giving some users the chance to choose the player within the settings and access Flash-based web content from the TV networks like NBC , Fox and CBS . `` We also wanted to use the cloud to offer new features or capabilities that solve customer frustrations - one we heard often from customers was that they wanted to view Flash content , '' Amazon 's Kurt Kufeld told the site . The approach being taken by Amazon is similar to that taken by other browsers and apps , such as Opera and Skyfire on iOS in recent years . Because a lot of the Silk browser 's heavy-lifting is done in the background on Amazon 's AWS servers , the workload can be shared between the cloud and the device . Amazon is yet to reveal how far it 'll take the experiment but said it has broadened Flash-friendly access to around a dozen sights at the time of writing . `` We heard from a lot of customers that they were disappointed when Adobe chose to stop supporting Flash in mobile devices , so we 've since been working hard to develop a solution for supporting Flash without compromising performance , security , stability or memory , '' Kufeld said . `` It 's still very early days , and currently we 're focusing on video . I ca n't speak to what we may do in the future , '' he added .

For those of you getting ready for vacations and do n't want to pack a whole library , HP and Amazon have reduced the prices of their 7-inch Android tablets just for you . The just released HP Slate 7 has seen a $ 30 drop and is now retailing at $ 140 for the 8GB model and $ 170 for the 16GB in the US , with the 16GB Amazon Kindle Fire HD available for $ 169 ( £139 ) It seems like both HP and Amazon want some of the action from Barnes and Noble 's own recent price drop of the Nook HD and the Nook HD + . The Nook sale is still happening so we 'll see in the upcoming weeks which tablet everyone has decided to snatch up . After all , with so many tablets to choose from and at such great prices - which wo n't be here forever - how can you not be tempted to get your hands on one ?

Amazon 's Prime service started off as a way to get everything from soap to furniture shipped to your door faster and cheaper . Over the years Amazon 's company strategy changed , and the e-tailer shifted its gears from being the world 's internet warehouse to a digital storefront in the vein of iTunes and the Google Play Store . With that , Prime added free access to its virtual library , which includes movies , TV and books . On the surface , Prime seems to offer a lot for a yearly fee of $ 79 . But what do you really get for that money , and do the costs even out in the end ? If you 're curious about Prime and considering signing up , we 've put together a full rundown of what you expect out of the service , if it 's worth the fee and if it 's right for you , plus how it stacks up to competing offerings . Amazon Prime lets you order practically anything from its gigantic Web warehouse and have it shipped within two days for free . It does n't matter what the item is or its size - screwdrivers , a fancy new DSLR camera , power tools , or a big HDTV - your order will get to you in 48 hours without an additional charge . If you need it overnight , just pay $ 4 more and it lands on your doorstep while you snooze . A membership will also give you free , unlimited access to 41,000 streaming movies and TV shows via Prime Instant videos . Kindle owners meanwhile receive the added bonus of borrowing one of 350,000 books from Amazon Kindle 's Lending Library . Unlike an actual library , there are n't any due dates . Getting an Amazon Prime membership requires a simple sign up process and an annual $ 79 membership fee . If you 're on the fence about putting down almost $ 80 on something you wished you could just try out first , you can . There 's a 30-day trial period that offers a test run that 's absolutely free . Sure , just about any purchase you make on Amazon for $ 25 or more comes with free shipping , but if you want it any sooner it can cost a real chunk of change . Especially if you buy something big like a Weber barbeque grill , which will hit you with nearly $ 41 in shipping alone . Meanwhile , buying smaller stuff like new Blu-rays costs about $ 4 to $ 9 in shipping per disk . Prime is great if you buy a ton of stuff online , and the service could end up paying for itself in the end . In some cases , your $ 79 may pay for itself with a single purchase if you buy something particularly big and heavy . That said , if you 're not a big Amazon or online shopper , you may want to skip a $ 79 fee that will only add to your bills . If you really need what you buy ASAP , Local Express Delivery will get your package to you within hours on the same day or the next . Unlike Amazon 's other delivery methods , there 's a much smaller pool of stuff you can order for same-day delivery . Local Express Delivery is only available in certain eligible cities , which include Baltimore , Boston , Chicago , Indianapolis , Las Vegas , New York , Philadelphia , Phoenix , San Bernardino , Calif. , Seattle and Washington D.C. You 'll also have to get your orders in by a certain time depending on which city you live in , for same-day delivery . In New York the cutoff is 8:30 a.m. , whereas other locations have an 11 a.m. limit . As a Prime member , you can save with Local Express Delivery . Without the service , you would be paying both the regular shipping cost on top of a $ 4 to $ 9 fee . Prime membership reduces this to a flat $ 4 charge per item . Shipping fast and cheap is kind of an old hat trick for Amazon by now . So with Prime , you can stream movies and television show episodes like Downtown Abbey , The Avengers and The Hunger Games . While it 's not the newest slate of streaming entertainment , it is a nice pile of media with stuff you 'll likely want to watch .

Amazon might be about to offer its own wireless network , if a report of some behind the scenes testing is to be believed . It 's been pretty busy at the Amazon labs over in Cupertino , according to sources speaking to Bloomberg , with the company supposedly testing a wireless spectrum controlled by satellite communications company Globalstar . The tests are said to have taken place around Amazon 's Lab126 facilities , home of the Kindle , so it seems likely that the network will be used to connect Amazon devices to the web . There 's no guarantee that Amazon is planning to launch the network itself , but it makes sense for it to be testing ways to get its products online and offer a more all-round experience for consumers . Globalstar has also admitted it is working with a `` major technology company '' . Then of course there are the rumours about the Amazon Kindle phone , which could also play a part in this , should it ever appear . Meanwhile Google has been making its own waves in this space , rolling out its high-speed fiber networks over in the US . We asked Amazon to comment on the rumours and will update if we hear more .

Amazon is beavering away with a new plan to take on the console world , according to latest reports . The online giant is planning to take on the likes of Ouya with its own-brand Android console which would tap directly into the company 's own Appstore , with a launch date pegged for the end of the year . This is according to Gameinformer , which has spoken to people `` who have knowledge of the in-development hardware '' and believes that the console will be a way that Amazon can leverage the gaming titles that are already available on the site . For Amazon , this makes a lot of sense . While it has been clever in undercutting the Google Play store with its free app offerings , releasing a console that taps straight into its store would follow the same incredibly successful blueprint that has worked for the Amazon Kindle and Kindle Fire . And then there is the fact that Amazon already has its own studio busy creating games , as well as a recently launched Steam rival to add to its gaming mix . There has been a flurry of Android consoles announced this year and this number will continue to grow . There are issues surrounding quality , however . There may have been excitement surrounding Ouya when it landed on Kickstarter , but reviews have been middling . Nvidia also got people talking with its Shield device . The link-up to Steam and the power behind it has impressed many but this is a US-only product so far . The Android console market is certainly in a state of flux , which essentially means it is perfect ground for Amazon to come in and take charge .

Amazon has launched a new marketplace , Amazon Art , which offers customers a bunch of artwork from galleries and dealers to drool over/purchase . This is all despite the fact that the company had a go at a similar venture back in 2000 , which ended up proving less than successful - in fact , the pilot survived a mere 16 months . But Amazon is obviously determined to prove that the internet is the right place for art buyers and appreciators to go to , without having to fake all that chin-stroking and `` hmmm '' -ing that comes with visiting a real gallery . Over 40,000 pieces will be available from more than 4,500 artists which makes it one of the largest collections available on the internet , according to the mammoth online retailer . Users will be given the `` gallery experience '' but you 'll be able to filter your search by price , size , subject , colour and style to make it all nice and easy . Amazon will also be packing out each piece with information on its background , its artists and other factual titbits .

Here 's your daily dose of random : Jeff Bezos , CEO of Amazon , has purchased The Washington Post . The $ 250 million ( about £162m , AU $ 280m ) cash sale wo n't affect his `` day job , '' the etailer founder wrote in a letter to Post employees . We followed up with Amazon to check on any leadership changes that may occur down the road , but were referred to this section of Bezos ' note . Bezos , content in `` the other Washington , '' will become the sole owner of the venerable publication , taking over for Graham family , its owner for decades . Seattle-based Amazon has no part in the purchase , which also includes a handful of other properties . Bezos ' missive and a Post article on the sale touched on the changing media landscape , one that 's shifted from print to digital at breakneck speed . The billionaire , CEO and now newspaperman wrote that there will be changes at the Post in the coming years . He noted there 's no map to navigate the publication 's future , though he said invention and experimentation are a must . Ironically - or appropriately - enough , Bezos last year said printed newspapers will be obsolete in 20 years , and his company is famous for its Kindle line of ereaders and tablets . Bezos is known for an against-the-grain streak , even funding a deep sea expedition to hunt for Apollo 11 's engines . Will the marriage of Amazon 's brain to the Post 's brawn bring about a media industry sea change ? We have 19 years and counting to find out .

Is Pinterest a dying breed ? Is n't it just for foodies , DIY weddings that probably wo n't turn out like the picturess and furniture we 'll never be able to buy ? Amazon does n't think so . In fact , the giant e-commerce site has just quietly created its own Pinterest-style page called Amazon Collections . The items you can `` collect '' however , are strictly from Amazon 's own website vs Pinterest 's pin whatever from wherever policies . The overlay is pretty simplistic right now since it 's still in the testing stages , so we expect it to get a little bit fancier as more people begin to use it . For now , users can browse topics like books , movies and collections they are following , plus create their own collections to share . Each Amazon product page will also begin to feature an `` Add to Collection '' button but since that will take awhile to roll out completely , they 've created a `` Collect '' button that you can drag to your bookmarks bar , which is similar to their Amazon Wishlist extension . How 'bout collecting some of our blips ? Or pinning if that 's more your thing .

Intel is the latest in a long line of tech companies to find out that television is a tangled web of rights and regulations , with reports suggesting that its grand web TV plans have been shelved until 2014 . Although it is known mainly for its silicon , Intel has its electronic eyes on the TV market , employing ex-BBC supremo Erik Huggers to lead a 300-strong team whose sole job it is to come up with a viable plan for television . We were meant to see the fruits of this in 2013 , with Intel announcing back in February that it was to release a set-top box service dubbed 'OnCue ' that would act like a cable provider in the US but all of the content coming through the web . The problem is the content - or lack of it . Reports now suggest that this has been put back to 2014 , with Intel now looking for a desirable partner to help remedy its content problems . So far the list , according to unnamed sources is : Amazon and Samsung . Amazon makes sense from a content point of view but the addition of Samsung does mean that maybe Intel is looking to partner up with a big TV manufacturer before something like an Apple television comes along with pretty much the same idea . Another content provider rumoured was Netflix but Variety has revealed that these discussions were never really taken seriously by Netflix . Considering its current popularity as a standalone app , it would be hard to think how joining up with Intel would benefit the streaming service . With Huggers on board , Intel does have some TV clout . He was part of the creation of iPlayer , which has proven to the world that on-demand TV through the web can work , it just needs a smattering of simplicity and good content to make it thrive . Currently Huggers may have the technology at Intel , but it is the content that is proving to be the biggest challenge of all . Via AllThingsD

Apple names its software updates by numbered versions , like iOS 7 . Android , meanwhile , takes on the identity of popular sugary treats , like Android KitKat . Amazon , meanwhile , has its head in the bottle , naming the new operating system for its new Kindle Fire HD tablets `` Mojito '' . Like previous versions of the Fire OS , Mojito is based on an Android base - Jelly Bean this time around - with Amazon then adding an all new user interface and custom features to the tablets . Also like previous versions , there 's no way to access the Google Play store from the Kindle Fire HD or Kindle Fire HDX , with Amazon instead pushing its own app store on Fire users . That said , Amazon claims that most Android apps will work natively on the new OS . While the Ui will be immediately familiar for any current Kindle Fire HD owner , there have been a few subtle improvements in the latest release . Amazon services have been deeply integrated directly into the platform , with new additions adding all new functionalities to the device . One of the biggest new features is Mayday , a dedicated button built into the quick settings button on the HDX which aims to deliver on-device tech support within 15 seconds of being pressed , every day of the year . Other Amazon technologies are also getting some time in the Fire OS spotlight . Goodreads , the ability to share your reading experience with friends , will be further integrated into the OS care of a free over the air update in November . The same update will also bring second screen content sharing to your TV , the ability to archive unnecessary content to the cloud with one tap , and deeper enterprise support . Also interesting is the expansion of Amazon 's X-ray feature to music , allowing users to download song lyrics and sing along . The service continues to be offered for TV shows and movies , which provides relevant information about the program on your TV based on the audio . Amazon is one of the biggest names in the cloud business , so it 's no surprise the new operating system takes advantage of that . Amazon will let you organise all your collections , from books and apps to TV shows and movies , with all content stored in the cloud , and synced across Amazon devices using Whispersync with the November update . There 's also been moves into family friendly content through Kindle Freetime , which gives parents the ability to whitelist content for their kids consumption . There 's no official word on whether the Mojito build of the Fire OS will be rolled out to older Amazon tablets , although it seems likely given Amazon 's previous track record with software updates .
Along with a 7-inch Kindle Fire HD refresh , Amazon has unveiled a new range of Kindles in the form of the Fire HDX , which will come in 7-inch and 8.9-inch varieties . Stronger contenders against the iPad , iPad mini and the new Nexus 7 , the Kindle Fire HDX family shows a bit more power inside and out . And at those prices , Amazon sure is promising a lot , with the new models coming preloaded with the new Fire OS 3.0 `` Mojito '' , which includes the helpful , but slightly scary Mayday button . `` It 's been just two years since we introduced the first Kindle Fire , and the team is innovating at an unbelievable speed , '' said Jeff Bezos , Amazon.com Founder and CEO . `` We 've worked hard to pack this much hardware , innovation , and customer obsession into these prices . '' Amazon is introducing Retina display-beating `` HDX displays '' in this new range , with the 7-inch variety boasting 323 ppi in its 1920 x 1200 resolution screen and the 8.9-inch tablet touting 339 ppi in its 2560 x 1600 resolution screen . For pixel-peepers , comparatively , the iPad with Retina display sports a 1536 x 2048 resolution 9.7-inch screen with 264 ppi , while the new Nexus 7 has a 1920 x 1200 resolution screen with 323 ppi . Amazon is claiming that its HDX display also has perfect colour accuracy ( or 100 % sRGB ) , as well as `` dynamic image contrast '' , which adjusts pixel colours depending on the ambient lighting . To power this screen , both HDX models sport quad-core 2.2 HGz processors with 2GB RAM and Ardeno 330 graphics for gaming . Both models have HD front-facing cameras , but the 8.9-inch model also sports an 8MP rear-facing camera too . The 8.9-inch models battery rates at 12 hours mixed use and 18 hours reading , according to Amazon , while the 7-inch model rates at 11 hours for mixed use and 17 hours for reading . Coming in 16GB , 32GB and 64GB , with Wi-Fi only or 4G-enabled , there are a variety of flavours to choose from . Pricing for the 7-inch HDX will start at US $ 229 ( about £143 , AUD $ 244 ) for the 16GB Wi-Fi only option with Special Offers , while the 8.9 HDX will start at $ 379 ( about £237 , AUD $ 404 ) for the same configuration . Pre-order for both models start today , with the 7-inch Fire HDX Wi-Fi variant due to start shipping on October 18 and the 7-inch 4G-capable variant shipping from November 14 . The 8.9-inch Wi-fi variant will begin shipping November 7 , while the 4G-enable model is due to begin shipments on December 10 .
Along with introducing its new Fire HDX range , Amazon has refreshed its 7-inch Kindle Fire HD , which will now tote a very low US $ 139 ( about £86 , AUD $ 148 ) price tag . The new Kindle Fire HD sports a 7-inch screen with 1,280 x 800 resolution , at 216ppi , which sits close to the full-size iPad , which has a 264ppi Retina display . The new Kindle HD is also powered by Amazon 's new Fire OS 3.0 `` Mojito '' and a dual-core 1.5Ghz processor , which apparently makes it 60 % faster than the previous generation of Kindle Fires according to Amazon . It also has dual-band Wi-Fi , dual speakers with Dolby Digital Plus and a battery life quoted at 10 hours of mixed use , similar to its 8.9-inch brother . But unfortunately while the older 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD gives you the option for 4G , the 7-incher remains LTE-less . It also does away with any cameras , but is lighter at 345 grams . Of course , the missing features and smaller form means a lower price , one that starts at US $ 139 for the 8GB variant and US $ 169 ( about £105 , AUD $ 180 ) for the 16GB model . It 's still cheaper than the older-gen 7-inch Kindle HD , which had a starting price of US $ 199 for a 16GB option . `` Two years ago , we revolutionised the tablet industry with the breakthrough $ 199 price point for tablets - now we 're doing it again with the $ 139 price point , '' said Jeff Bezos , Amazon.com founder and CEO . You can add US $ 13 to each model if you want the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD without Amazon 's `` Special Offers '' . Pre-orders begin today , with both variants due to begin shipping from October 2 .

Amazon Instant Video added Apple TV AirPlay support today , but the e-tailer may have another project cooking to take Apple 's set-top head on in the living room . Let 's start with the Instant Video app update . Now app owners can stream content from their mobile device to a television via AirPlay . It 's not an earth-shaking update , but a function Apple TV owners are sure to welcome . Users were previously able to switch from watching content on their iPhone , iPad or iPod touch to viewing on a Kindle Fire HD , PS3 , Xbox 360 , PC , Mac or a number of connected TVs and Blu-ray players . Throw Apple TV in the mix and you 've got a growing Instant Video network that should force Hulu and Netflix to take notice . Instant Video is free with an Amazon Prime subscription , though non-Prime members can buy or rent videos from the company 's 140,000-strong catalog . Today 's update also brings with it some new IMDB goodies , including cast and director info , ratings , `` goofs , '' trivia and quotes . While today 's Instant Video update is an incremental step in Amazon stomp into the living room , AllThingsD has word that we could see the company seriously encroach on Apple TV 's turf as soon as next month . According to the site , Amazon is planning to release its own set-top box in the fall . Developer sources indicate the launch date wo n't happen until mid-October at the earliest , but that 's really only a month away . Amazon would join a growing connected TV space , shouldering next to the likes of not only Apple but Roku , Sony , Google , Microsoft and , eventually , Intel . With an Amazon phone likely in the works too , seems Amazon is preparing to hit a lot of top contenders where it hurts .

Vinyl is aliiive ! According to Amazon anyway . The e-tailer giant has seen a steady 745 % increase in vinyl sales since 2008 and released an infographic today to prove it . Because you know it 's true if it 's in an infograph . Reasons for the high percentage may be cultural ( hipsterism ? ) and in some part down to Amazon AutoRip , a feature that offers a free MP3 version of certain albums alongside the physical vinyl and CD . So rock on , vinyl lovers . Digital music wo n't slow your roll . Our blips are something of a cultural phenomenon too .

The most popular feature of macOS 10.14 Mojave is , perhaps , the system-wide Dark Mode , with some software developers already updating their applications to adopt the new look . Google Chrome , however , is a little late to the party . Although version 71 of Chrome was released this week , it doesn ’ t support a dark mode on macOS Mojave , but that ’ s about to change . According to a Reddit thread , a Google developer submitted a code change a few days ago , suggesting that a dark theme for Chrome for macOS Mojave will be available in the near future . The feature is currently in early beta testing as there are a few kinks that need to be ironed out before a public release . A bug report lists the issues Google is currently facing with the implementation of dark mode for the macOS Mojave version its web browser . However , the most telling issue is “ how the dark mode for Mojave will be distinguishable from Incognito mode ” . Google already uses a dark theme to differentiate between a regular Chrome window and its Incognito ( private ) window , but the same workarounds would not work for the new feature on Mojave . “ For Incognito mode ( which is currently dark ) , developers used to call ` chrome.browserAction.setIcon ( ) ` for every tab and use a lighter browser action icon when the tab is in an incognito window . But this workaround can ’ t be used to deal with dark themes , nor with the new dark mode , because there is no clue if the current theme is light or dark , and whether Mojave ’ s dark mode is turned on or off . ” However , the code change has passed the review process and will find its way into an upcoming stable release , most likely in early 2019 . While Google figures out how to enable the feature , it ’ s available on the search giant ’ s open-source testing platform , Chromium . From there , code changes are implemented on Canary ( an early-release testing browser ) , then on Chrome Dev , followed by Chrome Beta and finally to the publicly available browser itself , with the entire process taking approximately six weeks . With Chrome 72 already in the pipeline for a January release , no new features will be added to it , so we ’ re hoping version 73 – which could arrive in March – brings dark mode support for Mojave . In the meantime , though , third-party plugins are available on the Chrome Store to add the feature to the browser .
The launch of a new Amazon Kindle Fire tablet is probably just around the corner , judging by an official-looking press render , which appeared online this weekend . The leak , from the super-prolific @ evleaks Twitter account , shows what looks to be a refreshed version of the 7-inch Amazon Kindle Fire , rather than the HD version . The render , which does not showcase a front-facing camera on the device , was posted along with the simple message `` Another upcoming Kindle , '' on Sunday . Recent reports and leaks have pointed to an upcoming Kindle Fire refresh , with rumours suggesting there could be three new devices on the way before the end of the year . Expectations are that the devices will be launched in September or October - a year from the outing of the current generation , and in plenty of time for the Christmas rush . The HD version ( s ) of the device is expected to pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor plus an Adreno 330 graphics chip . Speculation also mentions a memory bump to 2GB RAM . Naturally , you 'll be the first to know when anything official goes down . Via Engadget

Amazon has outed an all-new Kindle Paperwhite , hours after a listing for the updated e-reader appeared before it was yanked . Now , it looks like Amazon is putting its foot down on the new and improved Paperwhite . The e-commerce giant left the Paperwhite 's order page - listed as $ 119 ( with special offers ) - up for all to gawk at . Without special offers ( a.k.a . ads ) , the new Paperwhite will retail for $ 139 , though it looks to be U.S.-only for now . The Paperwhite 's price converts to about £76/AU $ 131 and £89/AU $ 153 , respectively . We 're not looking at a completely made-over machine here , instead seeing some incremental improvements that should be welcome to readers . New display tech supposedly boosts the screen 's contrast renders and offers better reflectivity , while a next-gen built-in light helps guide light closer to the screen , translating into less eyestrain . The processor is 25 % faster , so you should be able to breezily flip through pages and look up tip-of-the-tongue definitions . A 19 % tighter touch grid supposedly helps the new Paperwhite respond to even the smallest pricks with increased accuracy . While the outside looks largely the same and there 's not a drastic jump in internals , there are a few software additions that should make the device a better buy than before . The new Paperwhite ( we 're back to trying not to write `` Paperweight '' ) will eventually land with Goodreads integration , offering users a peak at what 20 million-plus users are leafing through plus the ability to rate reads . Kindle FreeTime for Paperwhite is also on the way , geared towards giving younger readers some age-appropriate incentives to hitting the books . The new Paperwhite will also feature Smart Lookup , Vocabulary Builder and Kindle Page Flip features . Update : AllThingsD reported that the new Paperwhite does n't say `` Kindle '' on the rear casing , but instead has `` Amazon '' inscribed on its backside . Peter Larsen , Amazon vice president of Kindle product management , told the site the change was due to international recognition ambitions . `` Amazon '' is apparently more recognized than `` Kindle '' outside of the U.S. , so as the company moves into countries like India , China and Mexico , it wants `` Amazon '' front ( or back ) and center .
Amazon has announced its latest push into turning every living thing into a digital entity , with the arrival of Amazon MatchBook . Amazon MatchBook is n't just an excuse for Amazon to unleash another witty fire-based pun into the ether , it 's a service that will turn a print edition purchase you have made on Amazon into a digital copy . Unlike AutoRip , where Amazon turned all CD purchases made on the site into digital copies for free , MatchBook does cost a little bit of money . According to Amazon , customers will be able to grab a digital copy for $ 2.99 , $ 1.99 , $ 0.99 , or free . And , yes , they are dollar signs which means that MatchBook is only available in the US for the moment . Speaking about MatchBook , Russ Grandinetti , Vice President of Kindle Content , said : `` If you logged onto your CompuServe account during the Clinton administration and bought a book like Men Are from Mars , Women Are from Venus from Amazon , Kindle MatchBook now makes it possible for that purchase - 18 years later - to be added to your Kindle library at a very low cost . '' Yes , Amazon remembers what you 've bought all the way back to 1995 . Over 10,000 books will already be available when Kindle MatchBook launches in October but you will have to wait for your favourite author to agree to joining the service before you get discounted digital copies . Some of the authors ( or their estates ) that have already signed on the digital line include : Ray Bradbury , Michael Crichton , Blake Crouch , James Rollins , Jodi Picoult , Neil Gaiman , Marcus Sakey , Wally Lamb , Jo Nesbo , Neal Stephenson , and JA Jance . And , no , we do n't think that Ray Bradbury being first on the list is a coincidence given Amazon 's obsession with fire and books .

There 's been plenty of buzz around a possible Amazon phone , and just when we thought the rumours had run out , they pull us back in . The latest word , according to AppleInsider , is that the phone will use 3D gesture and eye-tracking control for input and will arrive in the second quarter of 2014 . The phone will apparently have six camera modules , four of which will be VGAs , one on each of the device 's four corners . These will be the ones that detect 3D gesture and eye tracking . There will also be a 13-megapixel camera on the rear and a 12-megapixel front-facer , while the phone is said to have a 4.7-inch touch display and Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor . This all comes from people `` familiar with the company 's plans , '' but AppleInsider states that the same sources have been on the money with their information in the past . The Amazon phone is n't all we 're hearing about though . AllthingsD is reporting that Amazon 's adventure into our living rooms is facing delays , with the rumoured Amazon TV box apparently not touching down until , most likely , spring 2014 . There are a number of possible reasons for the delay , but the favourite going around right now is that Amazon does n't believe its effort is distinguished enough from its competitors right now . The Amazon TV was believed to be arriving towards the end of this year but time is quickly running out . Still , we 'd rather wait and see a stronger contender that really gives Apple TV and Roku a run for their money .

On the verge of buying an Apple TV box ? You may want to hold fire until after Apple 's launch even on October 22 . Amazon France and Amazon Germany both listed the Apple TV box as unavailable until October 23 - Amazon France has since changed its tune . That two Amazon outlets have run out of Apple TV stock with an Apple event just around the corner has set our hardware-refresh senses tingling . So while we 're expecting a new iPad and an iPad mini 2 , we 're also thinking Apple will release an upgraded set top box to boot . What it almost certainly wo n't be is a full-on Apple iTV television set though , so do n't go chucking your TV out in preparation . We 're also hoping for more info on that new Mac Pro , a release date for OS X Mavericks and maybe - just maybe - word of the Apple iWatch .

Amazon may be hawking more than just the Kindle Fire HDX in the lead up to Christmas , as it is reportedly launching its own media streaming device in a matter of weeks . The company 's set-top box , labeled Firetube by trademark documents last week , is expected to have a release date that 's in time for the holiday selling season , according to the Wall Street Journal . Amazon 's small media streaming device sounds far from unique . It 's said to look similar to a Roku and support apps from a variety of apps . Of course , the main focus of the set-top box would likely be an Amazon 's free video streaming benefits included in Prime membership bolstered by an affordable price . This is akin to how Apple puts emphasis on its iTunes content at the top of the Apple TV while still supporting a number of third-party apps . Google recently released Chromecast for an affordable price too , and it was backordered on the Google Play store and Amazon for nearly two months . Amazon could replicate that success and do one better by including a Firetube remote . The company may offer a separate remote control for the set-top box , according to the Journal . Controlling the device through smartphone and tablet apps is also thought to be likely . At any time , Amazon 's set-top box could be shelved or delayed due to financial or performance factors , according to the paper 's anonymous sources . We 'll know soon enough , as Black Friday - the big holiday sales kickoff in the U.S. - is just seven weeks away .

Amazon Firetube may be the next affordable set-top box to disrupt the Apple TV vs Chromecast media streaming stalemate . The online retailer is reportedly readying a video-streaming device in time for the holidays , according to unnamed sources who spoke to the Wall Street Journal . This goes along with the recently discovered U.S. and Canadian trademark for the name `` Firetube '' by Amazon Technologies , Inc. , as first spotted by 9to5Google . While there 's no Amazon Firetube release date in sight , the company is said to have given app developers a mid-October deadline to submit their work , according to the Journal . The Amazon set-top box , reportedly codenamed `` Cinnamon , '' could spice up the media streaming ecosystem . It could open up to other apps , but heavily focus on hawking the Amazon Prime membership benefits and selling the store 's additional video and music content that falls outside of the subscriptions service . This is sort of what the Apple TV does with iTunes content up top , while also providing additional secondary apps like Netflix , Hulu Plus , YouTube and HBO Go . The unconfirmed Amazon Firetube would enable the retailer to expand beyond the reach of its Kindle Fire tablets and rival devices like iOS , Xbox 360 , PS3 and connected televisions and Blu-ray players . Amazon could also harness the power of its online site to encourage users to add an affordable Firetube to their cart , sort of like it is doing right now with the Kindle Fire HDX tablet . Seeing how Amazon just restocked Google 's popular Chromecast media streaming adapter after two months of it being sold out , we could see the company eager to add its name to the fray soon for an even more interesting Apple TV vs Chromecast vs Firetube matchup .

Amazon is now offering US Cellular smartphones that can be purchased online and activated over the phone on the contract-free US carrier . At this time there 's a limited selection of handsets available from US Cellular on Amazon , but they range in price from $ 30 ( the Huawei Ascend II ) to a few hundred dollars . Other US Cellular phones now being offered through Amazon include the Alcatel Shockwave , Kyocera Dura Pro , LG Envoy II , LG Freedom , LG Splendor , Motorola Defy XT , Samsung Freeform 5 , and ZTE Director . They 're not flagships by any means , but US Cellular customers shopping for handsets on a budget should find plenty to love about the new union between the carrier and Amazon . US Cellular offers wireless plans on a month-to-month basis , starting at $ 10 for a pure pay-as-you-go deal . The next plan up is 400 minutes , 400 texts , and 400 pics for $ 35 per month . After that you get into unlimited talk and text , plus 1GB of data for $ 50 a month or 2GB for $ 65 . With contract plans on the big carriers becoming more and more expensive , those are some pretty attractive options . Once you purchase a US Cellular phone from Amazon you can activate it easily by dialing a phone number . Via CNET
Update : Amazon finally clued us in on when and how London residents can expect to receive packages on Sundays . `` Throughout the Christmas period , we will be making deliveries on Sundays in London , '' an Amazon spokesperson told TechRadar . `` As part of our 'Amazon Logistics ' programme , we work with local and regional carriers from across the Capital who will be making deliveries every day of the week for the remainder of the festive period . '' Notice he said `` remainder '' and not `` reindeer . '' Amazon wo n't be delivering packages via Santa like we had hoped when we first glanced at this response . But confirmation of holiday-timed Sunday deliveries throughout London is helpful nonetheless . Original article ... Amazon recently announced that it 's delivering packages to customers on Sundays , and now it appears as if that 'll be the case for the next five years . A 78-page contract spells out the long-term commitment between the US Postal Service and another unspecified company , reported The Wall Street Journal today . The agreement has been heavily redacted so it does n't actually identify Amazon or disclose any financial data . It has all been deemed `` commercially sensitive '' and is therefore blacked out . Interestingly , like most consumer Amazon transactions , there 's 30-day return window before ink on this five-year agreement dries . `` The contract is scheduled to expire 5 years after the effective date , unless , among other things , either party terminates the contract with 30 days ' written notice to the other party '' reads the contract . The 260 weekends with Sunday deliveries are already under way and the 30 day window has almost expired . US Postal Service spokesperson Sue Brennan told us that the first deliveries kicked off earlier this month . `` On Sunday , November 10 , the Postal Service began delivering Amazon packages to residential addresses in select markets , including the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan area , '' she told TechRadar . Brennan did n't reveal which cities are going to be next to receive packages on this atypical delivery day , but Houston , Dallas , Phoenix and New Orleans are reportedly being eyed for 2014 . While this contract pertained to the US Postal Service and therefore Amazon customers located in America , London residents are reportedly getting a similar Sunday delivery deal . No , America 's financially-strapped government agency is n't riding the Pony Express all the way to London . Instead , Amazon is said to be using its own trucks on the extra delivery day . This is the same approach the retailer has taken with its Amazon Fresh grocery service in parts of its home of Seattle and Los Angeles . We reached out to Amazon for a comment about Sunday deliveries in the UK , specifically asking about the when and where . We will update this story when we hear back .

Details on the next generation Amazon Kindle Paperwhite , codenamed Ice Wine , have sprung up online revealing that readers may well be treated to an upgraded screen and new design . TechCrunch claims it 's checked out a prototype of the new Paperwhite , and the headlining feature is said to be a new , high resolution 300ppi display . The current Kindle Paperwhite sports a 212ppi , 6-inch display , so if the report is accurate the new Paperwhite will offer a huge improvement on its predecessor . That 's not the only difference , with a glass screen said to be on the way instead of the plastic finish we 've become accustomed to . The leak suggests it 'll sit flush with the chassis instead of being slightly recessed . Design-wise the new Paperwhite is said to be lighter , and it could follow the more angular design of the latest raft of Kindle Fire tablets , while the edges of the ereader will be squeezable page turn triggers . There 's also a new ambient light sensor on aboard , which monitors the light of your surroundings and adjusts screen brightness to give you the best display for your setting . In terms of when we can expect the next-gen Kindle Paperwhite , the ereader is apparently tipped to go on sale during the second quarter of 2014 .

In the battle of the streaming video services , the difference between Netflix , Hulu , Amazon Prime and others is usually in what exclusive content they offer . Thus Amazon was no doubt happy to announce that it 's just inked an exclusive deal with A24 , a film financing , production and distribution company responsible for movies like The Bling Ring , Spring Breakers , Ginger & Rosa and The Spectacular Now . Amazon Prime will be the sole service to catch A24 's streaming films , and they 'll arrive shortly after their DVD and Blu-ray releases . A24 has a full slate of moves due in 2014 as well , including The Rover , Locke ( starring Tom Hardy ) , Under the Skin ( with Scarlett Johansson ) and Enemy ( starring Jake Gyllenhaal ) . Looks like we could be in for a bit of an upswing next year . We have exclusive streaming rights to TechRadar 's blips . Take that , Netflix !

Amazon 's march towards world domination in the cloud is seemingly going unabated as the company announced yet another product , called WorkSpaces . As its name alludes to , it is AWS ' take on VDI ( Virtual Desktop Infrastructure ) which allows enterprises to give each employee access to a working desktop environment complete with all the required applications . Those Workspaces can be accessed from anywhere and from almost any mainstream device , mobiles or not , the only proviso being good connectivity . Amazon even demoed it running on its own Kindle tablet . Four bundles are currently provided in a way similar to Virtual Private Servers ( VPS ) . The Standard and the Standard Plus both come with one virtual CPU , 3.75GB of RAM and 50GB of persistent user storage . The only difference being Office Professional 2013 and Trend Micro Business Security Services . The Performance package , which is likely to be more appealing to Developers , come with twice the CPU , memory and storage . Like for the Standard Plus offer , Performance Plus adds Office Professional and Trend Micro 's BSS . The respective prices per user , per month stand at $ 35 ( around £22 , AU $ 38 ) , $ 50 ( about £31 , AU $ 54 ) , $ 60 ( around £37 , AU $ 64 ) and $ 75 ( about £47 , AU $ 80 ) and could represent up to 60 per cent saving in a business with 1,000 users according to Amazon 's hypothetical case study . Amazon Web Services is now officially competing in a red hot market given a second shot in the arm by BYOD and alongside major players like VMWare and Citrix . The company has yet to say whether the service will be available outside the UK from the start past the current limited preview period .

As the fourth-generation PlayStation 's launch looms , Sony is making sure that its console and portable gamers will have the freedom of choice to shop around for virtual products to play on their hardware . Word out today is that US residents can now purchase digital versions of their favorite PlayStation-branded games from etailers other than Sony . The place to launch the new service is Amazon 's PlayStation Network Store , which is now open for business and stocked with titles for both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita . PlayStation 4 titles are a no-show at the moment , but will presumably make their way to Amazon 's digital storefront soon enough , given that the console arrives this Friday in the US before making its way to Europe on November 29 . As a little extra incentive for buying digital versions , Amazon is offering a $ 5 credit for a limited time , good toward a future PSN purchase through the end of 2014 . The only catch is prospective buyers will only have 10 PS3 titles to choose from , thought it includes favorites such as Assassin 's Creed , Batman : Arkham Origins and Battlefield 4 . Amazon reportedly wo n't be the only etailer offering digital games for the PlayStation Network , although no others have popped up on the radar at this writing . Amazon 's PlayStation Network Store offers a glimmer of hope that Sony gamers will be able to shop around for the best virtual deal , thus eliminating one key advantage once held by packaged software .

Amazon has announced that it 'll start making Sunday deliveries in select cities via the US Postal Service and expand the extra delivery day to other regions in 2014 . New York metropolitan areas and Los Angeles are going to be the first cities to receive Amazon deliveries on the usually package-less day of the week . The program is scheduled to roll out to more cities next year , including `` Dallas , Houston , New Orleans and Phoenix , to name a few , '' according to Amazon in today 's press release . `` If you 're an Amazon Prime member , you can order a backpack for your child on Friday and be packing it for them Sunday night , '' said Dave Clark , Amazon 's vice president of worldwide operations and customer service . `` We 're excited that now every day is an Amazon delivery day and we know our Prime members , who voraciously shop on Amazon , will love the additional convenience they will experience as part of this new service . '' Amazon may be taking its assault on brick-and-mortar stores worldwide , as it 's reportedly including London into the Sunday delivery program . London internet shoppers should see Sunday deliveries specified at checkout on appropriately timed items `` later this month , '' according to The Wall Street Journal when speaking to Clark . Obviously , these Amazon Sunday deliveries wo n't contract the US Postal Service to get the job done . Instead , Amazon is said to be using its own trucks . This could be similar to the Amazon Fresh delivery trucks that the online retailer has invested in to provide groceries to Fresh subscribers in Seattle and Los Angeles . The start date in New York and London is reportedly November 17 , according to the Journal . We 're waiting to hear back from Amazon about the London roll out and will update this story when we hear back .

Amazon has launched a new scheme to let its customers help decide what TV shows and movies the company will make for its streaming services . Amazon Preview is invite-only for now , with the company 's favourite customers getting the `` exclusive opportunity '' to help shape Amazon 's homemade Movies and TV series . The lucky few will get early access to shows and films in return for their feedback . Amazon Instant Video , and its UK-based Lovefilm service , is ramping up its production of original shows and movies as it follows in Netflix 's stead . Netflix has already notched up an Emmy for its House of Cards remake , funded fan-favourite Arrested Development and is now gunning for an Oscar with its first original documentary feature film . Amazon has n't garnered quite so much success with its homegrown shows like Vikings - no doubt it is hoping that focus groups will turn this around and win you all back to the Amazon fold .

Are you ready to replace your old television screen with the best 4K TV ? If you 're coming from an old HD flatscreen then you should absolutely believe every word about 4K TVs . That 's because the latest batch from the likes of Samsung , Sony , LG , TCL and others present huge visual improvements like Wide Color Gamut , HDR and better upscaling processors that TVs made 10 years ago just did n't have . While a new 8K standard is poised to pick up the baton eventually , 4K is still the go-go resolution for a new TV in 2020 – with an intoxicating blend of crisp visual detail , more nuanced tone mapping , and the possibility of HDR ( high dynamic range ) improving the picture quality tenfold over our older HD displays , and barely any price markup for cheaper 4K sets . As it stands , over 70 % of American households now own a 4K TV , with that number only set to increase in 2020 – but with so many sets to choose from , we thought we 'd bring together the very best 4K Ultra HD TVs in one handy guide . What we 're looking for are 4K TVs that obviously look good , with great contrast and high peak brightness , but also support for multiple types of HDR formats , a strong stable of smart apps and , of course , an affordable price tag . If you recently bought something from another manufacturer that you love and you do n't see it on this list , it does n't mean we 've intentionally snubbed it . Unfortunately , best-of lists are tiny and we can only squeeze so many screens on here – and there 's a whole other round-up for the best TVs overall . That said , we 're always adding more screens to this list , so be sure to check back in a few weeks to see the latest additions to this TV hall of fame . What is 4K ? Watch the video below to find out : The best 4K TV of 2019 ... so far Last year , the Samsung Q9FN was the TV to beat . It won award-after-award for its features and image quality , not to mention its excellent , improved smart platform that came with Bixby support and Samsung SmartThings . However it wasn ’ t perfect and there were legitimate complaints about viewing angles and an over-aggressive local dimming system that crushed black detail . Samsung has clearly taken these criticisms to heart , and directly addressed them in the Q90 . The new model has a visibly superior viewing angle that holds its own against OLED , and the local dimming delivers deep blacks without losing shadow detail . To that end , the new Ultra Black Elite filter is nothing short of a revelation , rejecting ambient light in a way that just staggers belief . The Q90 is able to deliver images that can directly compete with an OLED , with natural colors , bright highlights , deep blacks , and well defined shadows . It can also surpass any OLED when it comes to HDR , with images that are often breathtaking in their detail and dynamic range . In fact our only real criticism would be that , unlike some of the competition , the Q90 doesn ’ t support Dolby Vision . However in all other respects the Samsung Q90 is an absolutely stellar TV that takes QLED to another level . Read the full review : Samsung Q90R QLED TV The smartest 4K TV on the planet in 2019 If smart features are the most important criteria for you when picking out a new 4K TV , then you ca n't do any better than the new LG C9 OLED . The 2nd generation Alpha9 processor , which uses AI enhancements to deliver stellar SDR and HDR images , helps make the upscaling and processing second-to-none with incredible levels of detail and image fidelity . Add to that a robust smart platform and new AI sound options that analyze and improve sound quality in real time , and you have one of the smartest – and , in our opinion – one of the best 4K TVs on the market . Not to mention one of the best OLED TVs too . Read the full review : LG C9 OLED ( OLED55C9 , OLED65C9 , OLED77C9 ) Vibrant HDR makes this a killer mid-range model for gamers and cinephiles The Samsung Q80T QLED TV is the new jumping-on point if you want the cheapest full array backlight QLED TV in the Samsung TV 2020 range . Strategically positioned just below the Q90T , with which it shares a number of advanced features , and above the edge-lit Q70T , the Q80T is the very definition of middle ground , but its performance is far from middling . Normally , it ’ s 4K HDR performance that steals all the headlines , but that ’ s not entirely the case here . Thanks to the set ’ s UHD Quantum image processor , which has trickled down from Samsung ’ s 8K flagships , and some new AI smarts , the Q80T ’ s performance with HD SDR content is a real showstopper . And that 's not even mentioning its excellent 4K HDR performance that rivals the best LCD has to offer . Overall , good contrast and vibrant color , coupled to sensational upscaling and advanced smart features , ensure the Q80T warrants its frontrunner status in 2020 . Read the full review : Samsung Q80T QLED TV This is Vizio ’ s best and brightest TV 65-inch : Vizio P-Series Quantum X PX65-G1 The Vizio P-Series Quantum X is a home run for Vizio . Sure , the SmartCast interface isn ’ t all the great , and the speakers are worth bypassing , but the TV is packed with awesome features and backed up by an excellent image quality . We ’ re looking forward to AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support , but even without those features the TV is still one of the best options in its price range . If you truly have deep pockets and want the best image quality out there , then it ’ s still worth going for LG 's OLED or Samsung 's QLED TVs - but if not , the $ 1,499 Vizio P-Series Quantum X PX-65G1 is an excellent option for those that want quantum dot tech in a smart TV at an actually affordable price . Read the full review : Vizio P-Series Quantum ( PQ65-F1 ) An OLED screen every 4K enthusiast will be lusting after A direct replacement for last year's Sony A9F/AF9 OLED , the Sony A9G/AG9 Master Series OLED is the new flagship of Sony ’ s TV fleet . It embraces a characteristically minimalist design that disguises a host of cutting-edge features like Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support , plus Netflix Calibrated Mode ( of interest to many ) , and IMAX Enhanced certification ( of interest to few ) . This is a screen that looks premium , and has a spec on the right side of righteous . The Android platform is easy to live with , that vibrating sound system entertaining and picture quality top notch . Offering Dolby Vision is a welcome refinement , but the caveat is a lack of support for HDR10+ . That said , it does a fabulous job up-scaling HD/SDR so it 's easy to overlook the lack of at least one HDR format . It 's undoubtedly expensive but , all things considered , this glass is class . Read the full review : Sony A9G Master Series OLED LG 's entry-level OLED is an amazing deal 55-inch : LG OLED55B9 | 65-inch : LG OLED65B9 The LG B9 OLED is possibly the most fascinating OLED set in LG ’ s 2019 TV range – in that it ’ s the cheapest one . Acting as the successor to last year ’ s LG B8 , the 2019 version of LG 's entry-level OLED again offers a beautiful OLED panel housed in cheaper casing and powered by older processors in order to keep the price below that of its more premium siblings , the LG C9 , LG E9 , and LG W9 OLED . Inevitably there are some corners cut to get there , and you ’ re not getting the excellent experience of the C9 or E9 – but if the B9 is all your budget allows for , it ’ s a solid purchase , and one we 'd recommend to just about everyone . Read the full review : LG B9 OLED ( OLED55B9 , OLED65B9 ) The TCL 6-Series QLED is a beacon of hope for budget TV buyers Few TVs have changed the home entertainment space in the same way that the TCL 6-Series has - it ’ s made high-end features like Dolby Vision support , full-array panels and Wide Color Gamut available to consumers at a third of the cost of the high-end TVs you see above . And yet , for most folks , the new TCL 6-Series R625 QLED will look nearly as good thanks to its vibrant color saturation . Why does n't it rank a bit higher then ? Well , the 6-Series uses a 60Hz panel which means that its motion handling leaves a little to be desired and its built-in speakers are n't quite as beefy as some of the ones found on TVs from Samsung . That said , if there ’ s a better value 4K TV on the market , we ’ ve yet to see it . Read the full review : TCL 6-Series ( R625 ) The Q70R is a solid mid-range model that has most of the flagship 's shine 55-inch : Samsung QN55Q70R | 65-inch : Samsung QN65Q70R Samsung ’ s flagship Q90R QLED TV blew us away recently with its wider viewing angles , deeper blacks , and superior HDR images - sadly , however , not everyone can afford the flagship model . So what can Samsung offer for those wanting to experience QLED picture quality on a budget ? Despite sitting lower down in the QLED line-up , the Q70R includes the same comprehensive smart platform , extensive connections , and cutting-edge features found further up the range . This isn ’ t the flashiest-looking TV that Samsung has ever made , but if your funds are limited the Q70 is a cracking QLED all-rounder that ’ s worth checking out . Read the full review : Samsung Q70R QLED TV A beautiful 4K HDR TV that desperately needs an attached soundbar Sporting the upgraded X1 Ultimate processor , Netflix Calibrated Mode and the latest version of Android TV , Sony ’ s mid-range X950G has a lot going for it . Right out of the box , the best way to describe the image quality of the X950G is… well , natural . It ’ s not flashy . It ’ s not overly bright . Colors aren ’ t oversaturated . It ’ s just a really natural picture with subdued colors and great black levels perfect for HD/SDR content . That said , if you ’ re the kind of person that wants a bit more pop to your images all you need to do is turn on Live Color in the picture settings . This mode works on HD/SDR content to add a bit more color saturation to the image and helps to make the image ‘ pop ’ in a way that really grabs your attention . It ’ s a shame that poor sound quality ruined such a great 4K/HDR TV , however , taken by itself , the Sony X950G is an immaculate screen with a ton of potential . Read the full review : Sony BRAVIA X950G ( XBR-65X950G ) A surprisingly good 4K TV from the burgeoning budget brand Hisense 's H8 Series has long offered high quality at a very reasonable price , but these days it 's getting harder and harder to make waves in the budget TV market - Samsung and LG now offer plenty of great 4K HDR TVs well under the $ 1,000 mark , while TCL has been making headlines with its $ 600 TCL 6-Series . But the H8F is a little different than previous-gen H8 series TVs . It 's the company 's best value TV yet and offers both Android TV and the company 's proprietary ULED TV tech that it claims offers better contrast and performance than rival LED TVs . Sure , it 's not going to compete with LG 's OLEDs or Samsung high-end QLED models , but this affordable 4K screen is one of the best in its price range , and the only sub- $ 500 model we feel comfortable recommending to our readers .

Amazon may have ensnared a million new Prime customers over the holidays , but given the amount of customers still waiting for deliveries 'guaranteed ' for Dec. 25 , the retailer may have been wiser to ease up on the boasts . As it bragged of having 'tens of millions ' of customers signed up for the $ 79-a-year , two-day delivery service , it was forced to hand out compensation to those who were n't able to give gifts on Christmas Day . The company is handing out $ 20 gift cards to affected customers , plus refunding those who did shell out for shipping , following complications with both UPS and FedEx deliveries . Customers may also be eligible for a one month free extension on their Prime membership if they take the issue up with Amazon . For its part , Amazon is claiming that orders were processed and passed onto the couriers in time for Christmas delivery and is blaming UPS and FedEx for missing the deadlines . `` Amazon fulfillment centers processed and tendered customer orders to delivery carriers on time for holiday delivery , '' an Amazon spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal . `` We are reviewing the performance of the delivery carriers . '' A UPS spokesperson added : `` The volume of air packages in the UPS system did exceed capacity as demand was much greater than our forecast . '' Via AllThingsD
Amazon is trumpeting the success of its Kindle Fire HDX technical support service Mayday , revealing it responded to users ' cries for help with an average response time of just 9 seconds . The Mayday service , which brings the tablet owners unlimited , round the clock , free tech support over a one-way video conference , gives users tutorials and helping them troubleshoot common issues The retailer said it smashed its goal of answering users who hit the Mayday button on their tablet within 15 seconds in what must surely be the some sort of record for customer service . When a user hits Mayday , the customer service rep is able to take charge of the user 's display remotely , and even 'draw ' on the screen to help point out features . While it 's a great sign for new Kindle Fire owners struggling to get to grips with their new tablet , we ca n't help but feel for the poor folks answering Christmas Day calls from people who ca n't find the keyboard . The company said the highlight of the day was a little girl pressing the Mayday button by accident , and her parents laughing in the background . Sounds like a great time . `` We set a goal for ourselves to have a response time of 15 seconds or less when a customer tapped the Mayday button - we 're proud to say that on Christmas Day we met this goal , with an average response time of just 9 seconds , '' said Dave Limp , Vice President , Amazon Kindle . `` We 're excited that millions of customers opened a Kindle Fire tablet this holiday season , and we 're glad so many customers tried out the Mayday button .

Amazon made a whole lot of money this Christmas , but it 's not being a Scrooge by hoarding all of its riches . Instead , it 's giving back to users of the Amazon Appstore this week . The retailers announced that from now until December 28 , users who download anything from its app store will be rewarded with $ 5 credit ( about £3.06 , AU $ 5.60 ) toward a future app purchase . We confirmed that this deal for Android and Kindle device users applies to customers worldwide by logging into Amazon.com and making any app purchase there . `` For our international customers , they can get the $ 5 credit if they download an app from the Amazon Appstore via Amazon.com , '' a company spokesperson told TechRadar today . In addition to running this four-day promotion , the online retailer is highlighting its `` free app of the day '' section that benefits both Android and Kindle owners . Angry Birds Star Wars II and Doodle Farm are among the popular apps that do n't cost any money for 24 hours one day this week . And , yes these are the full , paid version of the games . It 's good timing since these free apps fulfill the requirement to earn that promotion credit , as long as it 's done before December 29 . Not a bad deal . You get a free app and credit toward another paid app in the future . Amazon gets to remind you that its Google Play store alternative still exists .

Amazon is going to shoot all its new shows in Ultra HD 4K in 2014 . The shows in question include Amazon 's first full-length ( yet to be announced ) drama series and the rest of Amazon 's slate of five new comedy and drama pilots scheduled for next year . The 4K shows will be available on Lovefilm in the UK and on Prime Instant Video in the US , although Amazon is fuzzy on the details like , say , how much bandwidth these bad boys are going to need . It 's good news , though , as while this year has been big on 4K-capable hardware , we 're still being deprived of much in the way of actual stuff to watch in the super high resolution format . There are currently a handful of 4K Blu-ray discs on the market , as well as some games . You 'll obviously need a 4K-capable television to watch Amazon 's 4K shows - and hey , look , what 's this ? It 's only a round-up of the best Ultra HD TVs around .

First drones , now groceries . There is no end to Amazon 's it's-so-crazy-it-may-just-work thinking , which may also turn us into a society of shut-ins . USA Today has word from in the know sources that Amazon is prepping a service called Pantry to sell and deliver items usually found in grocery stores . Due to launch in 2014 , customers will be able to fill set sized boxes with items like kitchen paper rolls , pet food , dry items and beverages . They can load the box as much as they can up to a certain weight limit , and as long as the box does n't tip the scale too far , Amazon will ship it for a small fee . The service is aimed at Amazon Prime customers and is said to put warehouse club stores like Costco in its sights . Pantry will start with 2,000 items and it sounds like it 's all systems go from here on out . `` Clean up , aisle 7 . We have a blip spill . I repeat , we have a blip spill . ''

Amazon 's announcement that it might start to deliver products by an unmanned micro-copter-thing within the next five years led to almost complete derision from the internet , as the Twitter comedians imagined a future in which robocopters drop packages in gutters and on rooftops before veering out of control and swiftly and emotionlessly decapitating amazed onlookers . The facts , according to Amazon , are that its Amazon Prime Air service will get packages to customers in some areas within 30 minutes , while Amazon claims it 's only waiting for regulatory approval before unleashing the drones in test locations . A move which , we have to admit , would be pretty awesome in a replacement hard drive emergency . But we ca n't imagine many local councillors agreeing to remote-bots flying down their leafy streets , and the mood of the online nation is equally aghast at the prospect of Amazon 's possible mechanised future . Beneath Amazon 's own YouTube reveal , user SeCs suggested it 's just a pure lie designed to grab more Amazon Prime subscriptions today , saying : `` Amazon used this stunt for publicity to drive people to their site . They want to appear as a tech company but the reality is that they are just a glorified middleman . Their drones will not work in inclement weather , they are prone to theft and destruction , accidents , they can not deliver in cities , etc . '' At least he had an opinion . The vast majority of commenters came out with lies of their own , with the easy and most repeated joke of the week being people claiming they 're going to shoot them down as soon as they see them , then steal the packages . Sure you are . Just like you shoot the postman dead every day and steal all of his parcels , right , hard man ? Viewer Kelly Harlow had a proper question , though , asking : `` Wait until a plane runs into one of these and crashes . How can they prevent that ? '' To which the answer was : `` A commercial airliner flies at 30,000 feet . '' Poor Kelly . She did n't reply to this . Probably trying to work out how to delete her entire account in shame right now . Beneath a cynical Guardian take on Amazon 's supposed innovation , user Bob_Helpful delivered a joke that at least veered away from the passive/aggressive threats to take them down with air rifles and stones , saying : `` Wait , we get all these complaints from Greenwald and the left wing press about drone missions in Pakistan and Afghanistan and the whole time they were just trying to deliver series 4 of Breaking Bad to a guy in Kabul ? '' Reader DeadKennedy was impressed by Amazon 's creativity and forward thinking , lamenting the fact that we 're spending our time mocking this sort of thing . He said : `` I love the negative comments on this thread . I love the cynicism and the people who are assured it wo n't work . It is easy to see why we do not stand a chance for crazy out-of-the box thinking in this country any more . '' Beneath a Wired discussion of the physics of the thing and whether or not current technology can back up Amazon 's dream , reader Michael Johnson warned us against underestimating how quickly the required tech can evolve , saying : `` Stable indoor toy helicopters have gone from impossible to every-kid-has-one in 10 years . I 've been watching starting from when a retired helicopter engineer started posting YouTube videos of developing the first one , to when he partnered with a model company to make a plastic version through buying several along the way , each one less than half the price of the previous , to now when they are sold in mall kiosks and the 7-11 . '' This generated a bizarre response by Bobbobitybob , who sees the future lying in `` ornithopters '' -- winged machines able to glide like birds . Bob 's serious future fantasy world involves : `` Large mechanical birds delivering packages , '' a move he says `` ... would please everyone , and there 's no point in saying 'Do we really want our skies full of birds ? ' because of course they already are . '' Robot birds carrying cheap toasters to impatient internet shoppers with guns ready to shoot down rival deliveries sounds a little more threatening than the usual mild mannered chaffinches , though , Bob . Finally , Huffington Post reader FreeSpeech4All put a further downer on the plans for aerial stuff delivery , making everyone feel a bit sad and gluttonous as we approach the season of conspicuous consumption with the grim hypothesis : `` We can develop drones to deliver cheap Chinese crap to people who do n't need it , but we ca n't feed , clothe or house our citizens who need it the most . '' Harsh but true . we are removing a few items from our Amazon basket out of solidarity .

Google , always shooting for the stars , is now setting its sights on robots . Why ? Because it can . Team Google snapped up seven robotics firms in the past few months , according to The New York Times , with the aim of building a bunch bots for manufacturing purposes . According to some people in the know , the move is also to compete with Amazon 's plans in retail . As for who will be heading up the project , that 'll be Android founder Andy Rubin - though he admits that robot manufacturing and delivery is another of Google 's `` moonshot '' ideas . But then , so was Google Glass . The bigger question is : robots vs drones - who will win ? Our blips are much more human .

Call it the future or a clever marketing ploy , but Amazon 's Prime Air octocopter delivery system is the talk of the web . It 's also already the talk of privacy advocates - US Senator Edward Markey has issued a statement urging the Federal Aviation Administration to set up privacy regulations before drones begin dropping parcels . `` Before drones start delivering packages , we need the FAA to deliver privacy protections for the American public , '' Markey said in a statement . `` Convenience should never trump constitutional protections . '' The senator has previously introduced legislation to guard against spying on US citizens by drones . Even though Amazon 's unmanned delivery machines are still some years away ( and would have to comply with FAA rules anyway ) , privacy concerns are an important wrinkle Amazon will have to iron out . Not to mention the seemingly inevitable impulse to steal the damn things . Our blips are coming in for a landing . Via CNET
It 's been a closely guarded secret and it 's no doubt cost a fortune , but at last Amazon can unveil its latest big idea : Project Get Amazon In the Papers On The Busiest Shopping Day Of The Year . But while the timing of Amazon 's Prime Air announcement is thoroughly cynical , the idea itself is perfectly reasonable . Amazon envisages a system where orders weighing around 2 kilos or less can be delivered by drone in less than half an hour . The jokes write themselves , of course . It 's fun to imagine a world where the city smog consists of millions of little Amazon drones battling their Tesco rivals , blasting us with ads and delivering pizzas to stoners , but while that 's a little far-fetched the numbers are compelling . Some 86 % of Amazon 's deliveries weigh less than the drones ' 5lb maximum payload , and that number would easily exceed 99 % if Amazon did n't keep sending microSD cards out in cardboard boxes big enough to hide bodies in . In cities at least drone deliveries makes a lot of sense , provided we can iron out some of the obvious issues : security , safety , reliability , weather , environmental impact , hacking , jamming , kids with air rifles , amorous birds and so on . Five years sounds awfully ambitious , bordering on the miraculous , for solving all of that , but clearly it 's a case of when , not if , delivery by drone becomes practical . That 's assuming we want it . As the saying goes , be careful what you wish for . `` As the saying goes , be careful what you wish for . '' Skies dark with drones are n't just bad news for would-be Dominos delivery drivers . Slowly but surely , Amazon is removing human beings from every part of the retail industry , one of the few large-scale employers we have left . Its online sales have trashed thousands of in-store jobs , its recently-acquired robotic division wants to get rid of most of its beleaguered warehouse staff , and in the foreseeable future drones and maybe driverless cars could make even delivery drivers redundant . It does n't pay huge amounts of tax to help fund the public sector , and do n't forget about Amazon 's Mechanical Turk , which is doing a pretty good job of driving down wages for white collar work . Amazon has seen the future - a shiny , digital and largely human-free future where everything you could possibly ever want is only ever 1-Click away and delivered either digitally or by drone . I 'd love to know where we 're going to work so we can afford to shop there .
Amazon and Blue Origin CEO Jeff Bezos has unveiled revolutionary plans for a science fiction-like air delivery system that would get customers ' packages to them in just half an hour . On the U.S. Sunday evening current affairs show 60 Minutes , Bezos introduced Amazon Prime Air , which will utilise unmanned drones called 'octocopers , ' to get deliveries from warehouse to destination . According to Bezos , the drones can carry objects of up to 5lbs , which would account for 86 per cent of Amazon deliveries . He also hopes to get the scheme approved and up-and-running within 5 years . These octocopters would operate totally autonomously as they could be loaded with GPS co-ordinates and sent on their way to the home or business , before dropping the package off and flying home . The CEO told host Charlie Rose : `` These generations of vehicles , it could be a 10-mile radius from a fulfilment centre . So , in urban areas , you could actually cover very significant portions of the population . `` These are electric motors , so this is all electric ; it 's very green , it 's better than driving trucks around . This is…this is all an R & D project . '' Bezos said the project can not begin operations until at least 2015 , when it receives rules from the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the United States , but soon after the drones could take flight . He added : `` I know it ca n't be before 2015 , because that 's the earliest we could get the rules from the FAA . My guess is that 's , that 's probably a little optimistic . But could it be , you know , four , five years ? I think so . It will work , and it will happen , and it 's gon na be a lot of fun . `` The hard part here is putting in all the redundancy , all the reliability , all the systems you need to say , 'Look , this thing ca n't land on somebody 's head while they 're walking around their neighborhood ' '' So there you have it ; a digital camera or a smartphone delivered faster than you could expect a pizza . You can see a video representation of Amazon Prime Air in the quite surreal video below .

Subscribers of Amazon Prime are likely to see a price increase as the two-day free shipping service is costing the retailer more , Amazon admitted in its fourth quarter earnings call today . This would be the first price increase in the nine years since the Amazon Prime membership made its debut in 2005 , and the markup is so far limited to US customers . Amazon did n't announce when it would start charging customers more , but it did suggest that the increase could be $ 20 ( about £12 , AU $ 23 ) to $ 40 ( about £24 , AU $ 46 ) . With the Amazon Prime price in the US standing at $ 79 ( about £47 , AU $ 90 ) right now , it could end up costing anywhere between $ 99 ( about £60 , AU $ 113 ) to $ 119 ( about £72 , AU $ 136 ) annually . Amazon was n't ready to reveal a timeline regarding its Prime price increase , but it did divulge why it 's likely to happen . Shipping and fuel cost have risen at the same time it 's started sending more packages to members via its speedy delivery service . It currently has over 19 million Prime eligible items available , and that 's adding up . Amazon would n't speculate about separating these shipping perks from its other Prime offerings , namely Prime Instant Video and Kindle Owners ' Lending Library , simply saying that `` we like the service that we have . '' Whether or not customers decide to renew Amazon Prime at a higher cost may come down to if the service has let them down in the past or intrigued them for the future .

Our living rooms could be pretty cramped come Christmas 2014 . Talk of Amazon 's Android console has just surfaced again with promises of a box arriving this year , but with Ouya and GameStick having already taken an unsuccessful swing at bringing Android gaming to the TV , it 's easy to be somewhat nonplussed by the news . Yes , Amazon has the advantage of being a big name and a respected distribution platform . Kindle Fire owners have been downloading games on their tablets since 2011 , and Amazon 's appstore is in place and ready for developers to jump in . But even with all that , betting on the microconsole would n't be wise right now . Moreover , $ 300 ( or just under ) is a lot to ask for an Android console when you put it next to the $ 100 Ouya . It does n't strike me as a wise move at all . The problem is that Amazon is potentially moving into this market at a very tricky time . Valve is pushing PC gaming in from the other side with its Steam Machines offensive . Meanwhile the PS4 and Xbox One sit in the middle , confidently betting on traditional graphical might - and Sony has an ace up its sleeve with PlayStation Now . With an entirely cloud-based entertainment experience , beamable to all our devices , on the horizon , why would we opt for a box that risks being so quickly outdated ? As for Apple , it has the advantage of already having its gaming trojan horse on the market in the form of Apple TV , its controller currently nestled in our pockets and ready to go . Even our smart TVs are becoming more capable of running games natively without the need for any extrernals . So if Amazon does have something in the wings , it will need to offer up a lot more than just gaming . Apparenty the box will offer music , TV and movies as well , so I suspect this rumoured gaming device is in fact the same set top box we 've also heard about . But it 's going to have to do a lot to convince gamers that it 's worth picking up . Because while I believe there 's a market for `` inbetweeners '' out there - the ones who 'll enjoy a halfway house between Candy Crush and Titanfall - it 's not a market that will buy a $ 300 box so they can play Tiny Wings on their HD TV . Maybe if Amazon has some killer exclusives that will change , but right now its app store is limited when compared with Google Play . Amazon does have the advantage of having a lot of weight behind it , which is something that the kickstarters have n't benefited from . But it needs to be careful to not fall behind the times in an industry that 's changing faster than ever .
Amazon might be the name you think of when it comes to business cloud infrastructure , but with all the features Microsoft has been adding to Azure ( with updates and improvements coming every two to three weeks ) , corporate vice president Scott Guthrie thinks Microsoft 's cloud platform has the advantage . It 's priced to be as cheap as Amazon but with more options worldwide . `` We have global coverage everywhere Amazon does and we have more regions too , '' Guthrie told us . `` We have China , they do n't have it yet ; in Europe we have two [ regions ] , they only have one , likewise in Japan we have two , they only have one . This gives you lots of options around redundancy . Right now , if Amazon went down in Europe or a natural disaster struck , every company that 's in Europe would have to move their data outside of Europe . Our strategy of having multiple regions is helpful for the latency side and also for the disaster recovery side . '' Neither Amazon nor Google offer businesses the same control over accounts Azure does , now that you can associate an MSDN account with your Active Directory account at work , he points out . `` Being able to use your Active Directory credentials now to log in to Azure and associate it with your MSDN account ; even very conservative organisations that previously said 'well , what happens when the employee leaves ? I do n't want them having a password . ' Now you can [ control that ] , now you can do multifactor auth . Now you can tie the two together and I can require that my employees only use ActiveDirectory in the cloud . '' Azure also offers more secure ways to get your data into Azure , whether it 's shipping a hard drive directly to Microsoft ( in your own country ) or getting a private network connection between your data centre and Azure using high-speed MPLS . Many wide-area networks already use MPLS and setting up a new connection is fast . `` For an MPLS customer , connecting to Azure is super easy , '' says Guthrie ; `` it takes less than a day . Getting dedicated fibre , running a cable ? That 's not a day , that 's more like three months . Amazon does n't support MPLS today , so we think we 're differentiated there . '' If you want to upload a lot of data , doing it over a network is necessarily the best way ( it can be expensive or it can just slow down your other network traffic ) . If you ship a hard drive , Microsoft has an extra layer of protection Amazon does n't , because you can encrypt the drive with BitLocker . `` FedEx is usually pretty secure but if you 've got critical data you want to make sure no-one can possibly tap it or intercept it , the BitLocker protection is a pretty unique thing that we offer to do that . '' IBM 's recent entry into cloud services does n't impress him either . `` We keep an eye on them ; they seem to be spending a lot of time on the marketing side , but I have n't seen that much on the engineering side yet . They bought Softlayer , which was n't really a cloud hoster ; it was much more of a managed hoster . '' Just because the IBM name is familiar does n't mean companies will choose them in the cloud . `` For big enterprise vendors that do n't have a solid cloud strategy , especially infrastructure vendors ; well , it 's interesting times . '' Azure offers a lot more than just running your VMs in Microsoft 's data centre and the backup services are proving particularly popular says Guthrie . `` Take backup , take our Storsimple offering , take Hyper-V replicas , take database backup , take SaaS management with Active Directory [ for single sign-on ] ; I think there are a lot of people who are basically extending the on premise environment to the cloud for IT scenarios , infrastructure scenarios . And next year I think you will see even more next year people using the cloud for disaster recovery and as a second backup site in case things go wrong . ''
A few months ago we heard that Amazon was working on an Android games console , but we did wonder if the rumour mill was getting its wires crossed with Amazon 's also-touted set top box . But we 're now hearing that a console is very much on the cards . According to `` multiple sources '' speaking to VG247 , Amazon is looking to release an Android games console later this year . Amazon 's Android-running gaming box will also offer up movies , music and TV content too , making us wonder if this could be `` bigger than Kindle '' product that Amazon recently said it was working on . The console is said to have the appearance of the PS One right now , looking `` grey in colour , oblong in shape and with sharp edges '' – although this could change come its official launch . According to the same report , Amazon is looking to follow its Kindle strategy and sell the console below $ 300 ( about £180 , AU $ 340 ) in the US , undercutting the PS4 and Xbox One . But Amazon will also be taking on Android consoles such as the Ouya , which so far have failed to hit big in the living room . Perhaps it 's going to take someone like Amazon to come in and truly start the fire - but it 'll be facing some stiff competition .

Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) has announced its latest storage option called Dense Compute nodes , a new SSD-based node type for cost-effective scalable storage . The new offering , open to Amazon Redshift customers , will let users start with smaller storage volume of 160GB for just $ 0.10 ( £0.06 , AU $ 0.11 ) per hour . This can scale to terabytes of SSD storage , with thousands of processor cores and terabytes of RAM . Redshift previously only offered Dense Storage nodes , but the new Dense Compute nodes are targeted at customers who need less than 500GB of storage , or those with larger data loads who want improved performance . The previous Dense Storage remains a cheaper option for those who are not as concerned about performance . Up to a petabyte of compressed data can be stored . Amazon 's Redshift platform , which launched in February 2013 , offers customers a quick and easy way to alter their storage provisions as their needs change . Storage clusters can be opened , shut down , or recreated within minutes . It is used by firms like Pinterest and Nokia . Customers can switch between the Dense Storage and Dense Compute nodes with one API call or through the AWS Management Console . Cluster sizes can also be scaled up or down in a similar fashion . `` We have been actively engaging with our customers using Amazon Redshift and watching them tap into insights that were previously out of reach to help grow their businesses , '' said Raju Gulabani , VP of Database Services at Amazon Web Services . `` Today , we are making Amazon Redshift even more accessible to customers , lowering the cost of a single node by as much as 56 percent while increasing the ratio of CPU , RAM , and I/O to storage to offer even higher performance .

Amazon , which has a habit of outing games before they 've been announced , might have just confirmed GTA 5 's arrival on PC . The listings appeared on Amazon 's French and German sites , the former of which has now been pulled . The German listing is still live here and has Windows 7 and Vista listed as compatible platforms . But it 's not just Amazon dropping clues . A leaked bug log for the game makes over 170 references to a PC version of the game , with mentions of a PC version existing as far back as June 2012 . PC Gamer pointed out that the log contains `` PC development bugs , numerous notes on DX11 support and a related 'smog ' weather setting . '' The leak actually appeared in an XML file back in September 23 , and has been passed around GTA fans since . The list has recently put on a Google Drive server , which PC Gamer managed to grab some screenshots from before it was taken off . PC gamers have been calling for a port of the game since its release its release last September . As the clues suggest , we can expect the PC version to look pretty damn awesome . Expect some neat mods to be floating around too , should it ever see the light of day . There have been rumours that the PC will finally get GTA 5 in March this year , so Amazon 's slip-up is timed perfectly . Now , how about getting it on Xbox One and PS4 as well ? What 's hidden away in those Blaine County mountains , anyway ?
Update : Amazon has released a statement , denying the Wall Street Journal 's report that it wishes to launch a live streaming TV platform . `` We continue to build selection for Prime Instant Video and create original shows at Amazon Studios , but we are not planning to license television channels or offer a pay-TV service , '' an Amazon representative said . Original story continues below ... Amazon could be planning to make an even bigger splash in the television market by launching a live television streaming platform to compete against traditional television services . The over-the-top network is in the `` early stages '' of planning , according to the Wall Street Journal , which claims Amazon has approached three major networks with a view to acquiring content . The report does n't explain how the live service would interact with Amazon 's existing original and archive content services , such as Prime Instant Video in the United States and Lovefilm in the UK . However , it seems likely that if Amazon is able to win the rights to live content it would fit in nicely with original content like Betas and Alpha House . Rumours have been rife for months that Amazon is planning to launch an Apple TV-like set-top box , so it seems a safe bet that any live TV offering would be streamed through that box . Apple itself is rumoured to be interesting in acquiring live content for streaming purposes as part of its long-anticipated Apple iTV proposition , but reportedly hit plenty of hurdles in the process . Can Amazon succeed in shaking up the TV industry by going all in on an 'over the top ' network ? It would n't be the first to make such a move ; WWE made its play to change the future of television at CES when it announced a 24-hour live streaming channel over the web . Via The Verge

If you thought the drone delivery system was n't quirky enough , Amazon is now planning to send customers shipments of items they have n't even bought yet , judging by a recently published patent application . The online retailer 's `` anticipatory shipping '' plans would see customers receive items before they 've clicked the buy button , based on their dwell time , visits to a listing , previous purchase habits and other metrics . The idea would be to completely cut out the shipment times and dissuade customers who 've been viewing items on Amazon to simply go out and buy it at a physical retailer . Although that would likely lead to plenty of confusion and lots of returns , Amazon appears ready to take the chance the customer wo n't say no to the Xbox One he 's been procrastinating when it arrives at his door . `` Delivering the package to the given customer as a promotional gift may be used to build goodwill , '' the patent states , although that 's unlikely to include high value goods . Also part of the plan is the idea that shipping times could be cut by delivering items in bulk to half way houses in areas the company knows the item will be popular . So there you have it . Amazon thinks it knows what you want before you do and is prepared to make a bet on it . Via Wall Street Journal
Whatever you watch on Netflix , listen to on Spotify or buy from Amazon this week there 's a good chance you wo n't actually make a choice - it would have already been done for you . With thousands of TV and movie options and millions of songs on tap , it may feel like there is real choice . But these companies with their vast oceans of content have crafted powerful recommendation engines , taking heed of what we already like and drawing conclusions about what else we would enjoy . We gobble up the recommendations because they 're so convenient . But here 's the thing . Netflix says 75 per cent of all viewer choices come from its Suggestions engine . That 's a startling figure for a tool that has its moments , but often that kicks up more crap than the meanest bull at the Texas State Rodeo . Increasingly , on-demand content providers and web portals are using big data to tell us what to watch or listen to , or at the very least narrow down the options , supposedly for our own good . Take Spotify , for example . Its entire platform is underpinned by a finely tuned trifecta of human editors , computer algorithms and social media data , bringing recommendations based on previous listening habits . It 's damn good at it too . While that 's initially gratifying , there 's a risk it could reduce the notion of musical free will to a mere illusion , if we come to rely on tools like Discover . Donovan Sung , the project manager overseeing Discover and the wider recommendations engines that pervade across the service , told TechRadar : `` There 's a fine balance between providing too much choice or too little choice in this information overload society . `` Users do n't want 100 options ; they would rather have one great option or four great options . We err on the side of providing too few . '' `` There 's a fine balance between providing too much choice or too little choice in this information overload society . '' Many have complained that Spotify Discover , which now acts as the service 's homepage , does n't do enough to furnish people with new music . Rather , it takes the 'you like X so you 'll like Y ' which promises more of the same , and the 'you have n't listened to Y in a while , give it another spin , ' approach . Again , Sung says user listening habits have informed these decisions . `` We 've actually found that a lot of music discovery sessions are n't about listening to new music , they 're actually about familiar music or things you 've played recently , '' he said . `` Music discovery , in the case of discovering new things , is not a super main use case for most users , those are the power users who want to hear every indie band they have n't discovered yet . There are ways for them to do that beyond Discover . '' Those users can use the App Finder to find curators dedicated to new music , they can follow influential playlist creators and there 's even a new playlist the company is testing which draws together the most interesting stuff from everyone in the user 's network . The Browse selection has a massive new releases section also . So it 's not that the new music is n't there , but us users are happiest when hunting within our own pack , according to Spotify . If we want new music , the onus is on us to seek it out . Perhaps the problem is n't with bad recommendations because Spotify 's are well thought out . In this case perhaps the suggestions have gotten so good we 've stopped looking beyond them and , in terms of broadening our musical horizons , that 's a problem . So what 's Netflix 's excuse ? It ca n't make the same claims as its musical equivalent when it comes to archive content ( which it cares less and less about ) or new content . It lost the rights to 85 classic movies at the start of 2014 , that New Releases section has been showing Louie Season 3 for about 6 months now , and our `` Suggested for you '' barely changes .

Amazon is running an event for prospective employees in Boston and its invitation hints at something pretty big . The Boston Globe , among others , reports that the company says the secret project it is recruiting for is `` bigger than Kindle '' - which , we assume , does not mean in specs and dimensions . There are a couple more clues to mull over : `` a new revolutionary V1 product that will allow us to deliver Digital Media to customers in new ways and disrupt the current marketplace '' . In plain English , we 're probably talking about the early stages of some kind of streaming product here , possibly bearing the Kindle brand name . It certainly does n't sound like the long-fabled Amazon Phone to us , but could it be some kind of media centre like a set top box , a Google Glass competitor or some kind of product we are yet to even conceive of ? Anything 's possible . It 's probably not a smartwatch though , so stand down . As Amazon 's only just recruiting people to work on version one of whatever the mystery product is , we 're probably in for at least a year 's wait before we find out what it is .

LinkedIn , the business social network , is suing a gang of hackers who used Amazon 's cloud computing service to circumvent security measures on their site . As a result of the breach , data from hundreds of thousands of profiles on LinkenIn were being copied and saved per day . `` Since May 2013 , unknown persons and/or entities employing various automated software have registered thousands of fake LinkedIn member accounts and have extracted and copied data from many member profile pages , '' company attorneys alleged in a complaint filed this week . LinkenIn has more than 259 million members , many of whom are highly paid professionals in technology , finance and business . The website holds a wealth of personal data that can prove highly valuable to those who would attempt phishing attacks , identity theft and similar scams . The unnamed `` Doe '' hackers used a number of techniques designed to bypass the anti-data scraping measures in place on the network . Their main method , however , was the creation of fake accounts , making it possible to circumvent restrictions placed on singular members . `` Registering so many unique new accounts allowed the Doe defendants to view hundreds of thousands of member profiles per day , '' read the complaint . The hackers also managed to bypass the CAPTCHA dialogue system , through which abusive attempts to register with the site are usually detected . Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) is taking most of flak for allowing the hackers to make the attacks they did . The feature allows users to rent virtual computers which can run applications and programs . EC2 has been used by hackers before . In 2011 the Amazon service was used to control a bank fraud trojan and has been a tool used by password crackers . The goal of LinkedIn 's lawsuit is to give lawyers the legal means to learn the identity of the hackers .

Samsung is keen to hurry on the 4K TV revolution so that we 'll all get buying new TVs , so the Korean giant has announced that it is partnering up with media companies to give us a bit more in the way of UHD film and television . A partnership with the likes of Amazon , Comcast and DirectTV along with M-Go and Netflix will see Samsung offering up more content through its Smart TV hub using each company 's respective app . A healthy 'content ecosystem ' more commonly known as 'lots of stuff to watch ' is vital to any new TV tech , with the likes of HD and 3D all suffering from a lack of content at their inception . Mindful that someone has to bite the bullet , Samsung 's move is necessary to show faith in the burgeoning 4K/UHD next-gen televisions . Using Smart TV to push 4K content is also , well , smart - reducing the reliance on local TV platforms to have to commit to expensive new filming equipment and find ways to deal with much higher bandwidth ( ie more detailed ) pictures . Samsung will also release a UHD video pack of popular movies and documentaries from 20th Century Fox and Paramount - which will consist of a hard drive loaded the content .

Amazon may be taking on more than just Netflix with its content streaming ambitions , as the company is reportedly in negotiations to deliver music to its Prime subscribers . The online retailer is in early but `` serious talks '' with major record labels in an effort to launch a music subscription service , according to Recode citing unnamed industry sources . Amazon would therefore be in direct competition streaming services like Spotify , Google Play Music All Access and the freshly launched Beats Music . Right now , music that 's downloaded from Amazon.com can be streamed through the company 's Cloud Player , but it 's only a music locker meant for purchased songs . It stops short of streaming tracks for free or a fee . If Amazon is able to sign with enough record labels , its music streaming service is expected to be bundled with Amazon Prime , rounding out the company 's subscription benefits . However , that could also mean Amazon is looking to justify a possible price increase that it kept mentioning for the US during its latest quarterly earnings conference call . Amazon Prime is becoming awfully bloated with its Instant Video and Kindle Owners ' Lending Library , and expensive decisions to revive shows and create original programming . Amazon has refused to address whether or not it would split its Prime offering for people who enjoy two-day free shipping but never use its movie streaming capabilities .

It might not be making it but without Netflix there would be no reboot of 24 . And I 'm convinced that without Amazon Prime there is no way that Heroes would have been brought back from the dead . Neither of these shows will be available through on demand , but it is the push by streaming services to bring back cult-worthy programming that has almost certainly spurred traditional broadcasters to do the same thing . Usually when a show dies it dies . There is no reappraisal , no second chance - broadcasters have taken into account the ratings , the advertising spend , the price of the stars and come to the very cold conclusion that a programme simply is n't viable anymore . This happened in the UK recently with Ripper Street . The show performed well for the BBC in its first series , averaging 7.1 million viewers ( a 22.9 % share ) , but the audience halved in the second series with some episodes reaching around 3.2 million viewers . Despite this , Ripper Street was voted the best show on TV by readers of the Radio Times in 2013 . The show in its short time has garnered the type of cult status that makes it Prime property , with Amazon announcing a third series will be made available through Prime Instant Video . Ripper Street may be a BBC production but it has global appeal . It was shown on BBC America and the Ten network in Australia , so the idea is that its re-emergence will bag Amazon new users for its on-demand service . This news came just a week after Amazon rebranded Lovefilm in the UK and wrapped it into its Prime service . While this move brought some criticism given that Prime is now £30 a year more expensive in the UK , it was inevitable it was going to happen . The service is now perfectly aligned with its US counterpart - an alignment that needed to happen if Amazon wanted to have a chance against its main streaming rival Netflix . Netflix is the pioneer of show resuscitation . Its resurrection of Arrested Development and The Killing made as many headlines when they were announced as its original programming did . As with Amazon , this two-pronged approach to TV programming is essential for these streaming service to not just standout from the television crowd but also stand up against the likes of HBO and AMC . Cultivating the cult is not always a surefire way of getting viewers , however . We all know what happened when Snakes On A Plane used internet chatter about the film to add new lines for Samuel Jackson . It was great publicity but simply was n't reflected at the box office . You have to make sure that the crowd you are pandering to has the money and the means to pay to watch your stuff . Reviving shows , though , is a surefire way to get people talking about your service . Ripper Street may not yet have the cultural kudos of Arrested Development but it is a savvy move by Amazon - and I wo n't be surprised if it is the first of many . Amazon Studios - where Ripper Street now resides - is actively doing more than Netflix in garnering its users ' opinion on what should and should n't be streamed . It 's serving up show pilots at an impressive rate and asking for feedback . Netflix has struck it lucky so far with House Of Cards but its original content costs a hell of a lot to make . House Of Cards is priced at around $ 4 million an episode - and it pays a similar amount for Hemlock Grove and Orange Is The New Black . Amazon is spending about a quarter of this on its original shows but both studios are making huge gambles with their new properties . This is why reviving older shows makes a great deal of sense - they 've already got a loyal fan base and this should result in higher viewing figures . While I hope original programming goes from strength to strength - it is certainly keeping HBO on its toes - it makes sense that Amazon and Netflix spread bet when it comes to the shows they add . Technology has helped massively in this , though . Where TV studios pour money into advertising , Netflix and Amazon can rely to some extent on their on-demand algorithms - they can choose the programmes you should be watching , giving them a higher chance of success . It 's great to see on-demand services acting as the last chance saloon for old shows - anything that shakes the cobwebs off the TV industry is fine by me .

There 's reportedly going to be a new way to stream all of those Amazon Instant movies and TV shows next month , coming from Amazon itself . The long rumored Amazon set-top box is expected to launch in March after the company scrapped its plans to release a so-called Firetube streaming device before Christmas , according to Recode . As earlier rumors have suggested , it 'll be an Android-based device that competes with Apple TV and Roku 3 , and it should feature other third-party apps similar to those boxes . The Amazon set-top box would also be in contention with Google Chromecast , which has just taken off with an open SDK and new apps - but its design will likely resemble a Roku device . Amazon has a growing catalogue of free movies and TV content through its Amazon Prime service as well as competitively priced Instant Video rentals and purchases of new releases . But the imminent Amazon set-top box might not stop there . The company has been rumored to be launching an Ouya-style game console for some time , and that could tie into the new device . After all , it 's been hoarding game developers , and gaming capabilities seem to be what Apple has planned for its Apple TV 4 tipped to launch in April . Amazon , known primarily for its online store and digital services , has gotten into the hardware business before with its line of Amazon Kindle e-readers and Amazon Kindle Fire tablets . The company 's devices run its own forked version of Android , which could be used by the set-top box , and its Google Play Store-alternative App Store . Like the heavily promoted Kindle , expect the set-top box to get in your face soon with front page promotion and `` you may also be interested in '' suggestions every time you add a new movie .

Amazon has posted job listings seeking game developers with experience making big budget triple-A video games , leading to further speculation that the bookseller is developing its own dedicated game console . That speculation was originally sparked in August 2013 , when anonymous sources said that Amazon was prepping an Android-based Ouya rival . The longer Ouya continues to flounder , the less and less appealing that sounds , but that may not be enough to stop Amazon , which opened its gaming division Amazon Game Studio in 2012 . The job listings , which have appeared on LinkedIn and on Amazon 's own site , call for a senior graphics developers and a creative director for game development . Both positions require seven or more years of game development experience , and Amazon posted that it prefers candidates who have experience with triple-A games . For the graphics developer Amazon prefers iOS and Android game development experience as well , but that requirement was left off of the other listing . These clues on their own do n't point toward anything with certainty , but it would definitely be strange if Amazon is seeking veteran game developers with seven years of big budget experience so that it could put them to work on casual Kindle Fire games or Air Patriots 2 . The other major piece of this puzzle is Amazon 's acquisition of Double Helix , the studio behind Microsoft 's recent revival of the Killer Instinct fighting game franchise for its Xbox One console , in early February . That combined with the job listings is what leads us to believe that Amazon may be hoarding as many experienced game developers as it can . `` Amazon has acquired Double Helix as part of our ongoing commitment to build innovative games for customers , '' the book-and-more seller told TechRadar at the time . Indeed , the company is clearly very committed to games , but exactly how committed remains to be seen . Via Recode

Amazon is said to be working on a console that will bring Android gaming into our living rooms at a price that undercuts the PS4 and Xbox One . Hold up – have n't we heard this all before ? The first console that attempted to bring mobile gaming to the big ( ger ) screen was 2013 's Ouya . But even with the low , low price tag and pleasing design , a lack of worthwhile games sent it plunging into the tepid pools of mediocrity . So what makes Amazon think it 's got a better shot ? We 'll tell you why in this week 's Gaming Spotlight , the first of a brand new series for TechRadar . In our debut show , Patrick Goss and Hugh Langley place their bets on the success of Amazon 's alleged 'Droid-powered system , as well as delving into the gossip surrounding Sony 's ( rumoured ) Oculus Rift-rivaling headset . To top things off , we 've also got our review of the PS Vita Slim . Talk about a tech trifecta .

Retail giant Amazon recently attracted attention for its plans to ship goods to customers using bird-like robotic drones . Collective brows raised even higher when a patent revealed plans for an `` anticipatory shipping '' service , designed to send customers shipments of items based on the time they 'd spent browsing products , their visits to a listing , previous purchase habits and other metrics . Paul Gibson , Regional Director EMEA at marketing and analytics software company AgilOne , talks to TRPro about the technology that Amazon might use to achieve this seemingly psychic feat . TechRadar Pro : What do you make of Amazon 's recent patent announcement ? Paul Gibson : Amazon is one of the best users of predictive marketing , and utilise their vast resources and budgets to achieve a great understanding of their customers behaviour , and therefore deliver relevant , effective messaging . This patent is yet another example of the impressive way they utilise this powerful medium , and would certainly overcome the often criticized delay between ordering and receiving goods . However , it could open the door for abuse , if people realize they can get free product just by browsing on the site . TRP : Why is Amazon always leading the way on predictive marketing ? PG : Having vast budgets and resources has enabled Amazon to fully harness all the elements of predictive marketing , and has lead to them becoming experts in customer retention . They have built systems , and algorithms that are able to collect data at every instance , from every touch-point , using a variety of campaigns logging your actions when you : search for something , purchase something , abandon your cart , send something back and even unsubscribe from their emails . Amazon are then able to understand your preferences , behaviour and likely next steps and then turn all this information into personal messages tailored to your responses . This gives them a unique place in the market , as traditionally this has been out of the reach of smaller businesses . TRP : Can other companies use predictive analytics to do this ? PG : Right now , yes , and this is really exciting ! Few companies have the budget and resources of Amazon , so this capability has traditionally been out of reach for all but the largest enterprises . However , due to the recent advancements in SaaS Predictive Marketing technologies , it is now possible for any-sized retail organisation - including those with a mix of on-line and traditional bricks and mortar operations - to harness this level of sophistication . This helps them to gain a consolidated 360-degree view of the multiple customer touch-points and delivering unrivalled data science , which in turn leads to more effective marketing , loyal repeat buyers and ultimately improved bottom line . TRP : Is software-as-a-service ( SaaS ) predictive marketing technology expensive to run ? PG : On the contrary , Cloud technology is helping to bring predictive marketing within reach of most businesses . Companies do not need to have vast data centres , nor do they need to spend years developing new technology , and adoption of true customer insight and relevance now takes weeks , rather than months or years . Historically , combining multiple data sources , and adding the required science was a time consuming , manually intensive and costly exercise , but SaaS predictive marketing solutions do all the heavy lifting , allowing marketers to concentrate on marketing . TRP : How useful do you think the technology being used by Amazon will be to consumers ? PG : Of course , the actual idea behind delivering something someone has not yet purchased could confuse , and maybe even scare off a potential buyer who may simply be comparing and having already purchased the goods elsewhere . But , in terms of receiving products which someone might need , for example if a retailer knew your printer cartridge needs replacing , this technology could prove to be very useful to consumers . It would mean you would never run out of a product which needs regular replacement .

Some weeks a story breaks that 's just so colossal , so earth-shattering that everything else just fades into triviality . You know , the kind of news that really puts things into perspective . We are , of course , talking about the fact that for the first time in 23 years , Sonic now has blue arms . And a scarf . And bandages on his legs . And Knuckles looks really weird . This week Sega announced Sonic Boom , a new part of the hedgehog IP which will form a brand new game ( for Wii U and 3DS ) and animated TV series . It 's also the first refresh the blue hedgehog has had since he first appeared on our Mega Drives over two decades ago . The gaming community has held nothing back in its response . `` Knuckles ... what did they do to you ? '' said Reddit user certze . `` I figured it out : Knuckles ate Vector , '' was OkamiKnuX 's theory , while Vaxid asked , `` I just want to know why the hell do they have bandages on their shoes ? '' `` Quite frankly I feel like the random bandaging of their feet kind of breaks the aesthetic , but that 's just me , '' added IKinectWithUrGF . All good points . But jest as we might , the game does look pretty good . And besides , consider what could have been - apparently Sonic Boom 's visual director had even wilder ideas for the redesign . After dying down in the post-PS4 reveal , rumours about Sony 's possible virtual reality headset have started ramping up again . Not only did a key Sony exec seemingly confirm it himself , some person , somewhere on the internet this week said they 've actually played with Sony 's Oculus Rift rival and compared it to Valve 's prototype headset in terms of quality . Oculus told TechRadar that it 's just not interested in the limited power of consoles , and so will be solely targeting PC for the time being . That means the consoles will need a different VR hero and Sony could time it just right for the PS4 . Also in VR news this week , Oculus announced its first exclusive launch game , Eve Valkyrie . Eve was one of the first games to let gamers try Oculus in HD and has been one of the most talked-about VR experiences of the last few months . The announcement is also a teeny tiny hint that Oculus might be firming up its market release . We still have our fingers crossed for a Rift under the Christmas tree this year . This week , TechRadar 's been playing ... Outlast ( PS4 ) OH SWEET MOTHER OF MERCY IT 'S TERRIFYING GET IT AWAY FROM US It 's not just been Sony letting cats out of bags this week . Amazon may have just dropped the biggest clue yet that it 's preparing a games console of its own . This week it announced it had bought Killer Instinct developer Double Helix , not something you usually do unless you have some pretty big gaming-shaped plans . It 's the third big clue we 've had in 2014 that something is in the pipeline . Amazon told TechRadar : `` Amazon has acquired Double Helix as part of our ongoing commitment to build innovative games for customers . '' That `` commitment '' is beginning to sound an awful lot like a console to us , and having exclusive titles is exactly what Amazon will need if it wants its rumoured streaming box to be taken seriously . Perhaps this could be a multimedia console to take on the PS4 and Xbox One after all . No links from our Future pals this week , but we think you 'll enjoy what we 've goat for you instead .

Amazon has released its next wave of original TV pilots for its Prime Instant Video and Lovefilm streaming services and will once again ask viewers for input on which shows should make the grade . The 10 new titles , which include potential drama series as well as comedies this time around , are available to stream now . The company asks for feedback once the single episode is complete . Just like last year 's offerings , the web giant says it 'll take audience feedback into account when it chooses which of the shows will be green lit for a full series . Amazon , of course , will still have the final say , but hopes gauging wider audience response will result in better success rates than traditional Hollywood methods . Among the new line-up is cop drama Bosch , The After written by X-Files creator Chris Carter and Mozart in the Jungle , a drama/comedy starring Jason Schwartzman . Transparent , a dark comedy , and sports comedy The Rebels round out the grown-up offerings , while the other five are aimed at kids . Last year , following the same process , Amazon ordered full series of Alpha House and Betas , while a TV adaptation of Zombieland failed to make the cut . The company 's more democratic way of choosing and distributing original content differs greatly from Netflix 's . The rival service tends to make the entire show before distributing to viewers to enjoy ( or not ) as they see fit . Via Recode
Amazon 's game console is looking more likely than ever as the company confirmed it has acquired Killer Instinct developer Double Helix . Talk of an Amazon console started last year , and more recently we heard that it had an Android console prepared for release later in 2014 . The company told TechRadar : `` Amazon has acquired Double Helix as part of our ongoing commitment to build innovative games for customers . '' That `` commitment '' is looking more and more like it could be a games console . And the fact that Amazon is snapping up studios is a positive sign that it may actually have some exclusive content . It 's rumoured that Amazon 's gaming box will also offer streaming of TV , movies and music . And going on what we 've heard so far , it could be arriving later this year . Microsoft told Polygon that it will continue to work on Killer Instinct with a new development partner which it will announce soon .

Amazon maintains its lead in the infrastructure-as-a-service ( IaaS ) and platform-as-a-service ( PaaS ) markets despite strong challenges from Microsoft , Google and IBM . All three of Amazon 's competitors in the cloud market are making giant strides , with Microsoft and IBM doubling their IaaS and PaaS revenues over the fourth quarter . However , in a market that grew by 52 per cent last year , Amazon kept ahead of the chasing pack . The Seattle-based firm recorded a growth of 65 per cent , increasing its total global share of the market to over 30 per cent . Data from Synergy Research Group indicates that IaaS/PaaS revenue in total for the last quarter totalled $ 3 billion ( £1.84 billion , AU $ 3.4 billion ) , with revenues for the whole of last year coming close to $ 10 billion ( £6.1 billion , AU $ 11.2 billion ) . `` The big three global IT vendors are putting the pedal to the metal on cloud infrastructure services and are rapidly expanding their service footprints and revenues , '' said John Dinsdale , a chief analyst and research director at Synergy Research Group . `` However , while they are gaining market share it is not at the expense of Amazon . It is doing a very impressive job of maintaining its leadership in this strategically important high-growth market . '' IBM and Microsoft , according the research , gained impressively large cloud-based revenue , though the bulk of that originated in software , private cloud services , cloud hardware and professional and technical services . Total Amazon AWS revenue , on the other hand , topped $ 1 billion ( £600,000 , AU $ 1.1 billion ) in the final quarter and well over $ 3 billion for the full year , more than the revenue of all its competitors combined . IaaS and PaaS revenue as a whole has more than doubled since the fourth quarter of 2012 .

It 's been suspected for months now that Amazon is cooking up its own streaming video device , and those rumors may finally take shape in a product shown April 2 . Press invites have headed out the virtual door for an event that day , asking attendees to `` join us for an update on our video business . '' While the Seattle company has some stakes in the entertainment scene with Amazon Prime video , but next week 's announcement may finally unveil its living room hardware initiative . A dedicated media device from Amazon has been rumored since last August , so it seems about time for this gadget to show its face . A report from last week suggested the internet warehouse might introduce a dongle that plugs directly into TVs to stream video and other content like Google 's Chromecast . Amazon has an expansive library of digital video , so it 's not a far stretch to consider that it would want to make web-to-TV streaming device . After all , Kindles were introduced to take advantage of Amazon 's wide eBook library , followed by the Kindle Fire for other digital content , magazines , and its Instant Streaming collection . While a streaming device seems likely , Amazon will run into plenty of competition with similar stick-like devices such as the Roku Streaming Stick as well as larger media boxes like the Apple TV and Roku 3 . A traditional Amazon set-top box is n't out of the picture , either . Alternatively , the new product Amazon may introduce on April 2 could be the gaming console we 've also heard rumor of recently . Last month , Amazon dipped its toes into the gaming world by first buying Double Helix , the video game studio that produced Killer Instinct for the Xbox One . The company has also put up job listings looking for more game developers . Then earlier this month , we caught a glimpse of the controller that will likely pair up with Amazon 's console . In addition to the controller looking like it came with an OnLive box , Wall Street Journal sources said that Amazon 's console would stream `` top-tier PC games '' at 30fps . Update : According to a March 27 report from Wall Street Journal , Amazon 's streaming media device will feature apps from other content providers , such as Hulu and Netflix . Amazon is also reportedly working on a free , ad-supported video and media streaming service that may launch in the coming months .
A price war for cloud services has broken out between the major players Google , Amazon and Microsoft . Google started the war last week by announcing that it was dropping the price of its cloud storage by more than 68 per cent . Amazon followed suit with its own cuts which range from 10 to 68 per cent and this morning Microsoft followed suit by matching AWS ' lowest prices ( US East Region ) for S3 and EBS , and reducing prices by up to 20 per cent and making the lower prices available in all regions worldwide . For Microsoft 's `` Locally Redundant Disks/Page Blobs Storage , '' the company is reducing prices by up to 28 per cent . It is also reducing the price of Azure Storage service by half . The cost of cloud services has been dropping steadily since AWS introduced the service eight years ago . This is the 42nd price cut during that time . The new pricing sees the S3 object-storage service drop by 51 per cent , while the raw computing services on EC2 fall by as much as 40 per cent . Amazon 's new prices take effect February 1 . Amazon , which pioneered public cloud computing in 2006 , is still the undisputed King . Its fast-growing AWS business helped transform the company from traditional online retailing into a tech industry giant . Earlier this week , Cisco announced plans to spend $ 1 billion over the next two years to build a new cloud services business , and Microsoft rebranded its Azure service .

Amazon is expected to launch a streaming device that beams video and game content to TVs , but it may come in the form of a small streaming stick , not a full-sized set-top box . The online retailer is preparing to launch the diminutive-sized streaming dongle with a design that resembles Google Chromecast , according to TechCrunch , citing anonymous sources . That differs from previous reports that indicated Amazon was developing a more generic-looking box , codenamed Firetube , that resembled the Apple TV or Roku 3 . Such is the trend , however . The thumb-drive-sized Roku Streaming Stick is serving up a similar streaming-on-a-stick approach next month and it too plugs into any HDMI port . While Amazon may be taking cues from others on the design of its unofficial streaming device , it could easily set a trend among dongles with video game streaming functionality . It is said to go as far as supporting full PC titles in an effort to better compete with PS4 and Xbox One in the living room , according to TechCrunch , this time citing a single unnamed source . The service is being compared to the ill-fated OnLive cloud gaming platform in which the internet and remote processors did all of the heavy lifting . Users needed minimal hardware . Add in the leaked Amazon controller , and this bundle could bring something considerably new to the front room with a cheaper entry ticket than any PlayStation Now streaming hardware . There 's no Amazon streaming dongle release date tied to today 's report , but with Chromecast expanding its footprint to the UK and the Roku Streaming Stick set for April , it should n't be long .

As you read this , flocks of people are descending on San Francisco in the name of gaming . GDC kicks off on Monday and it 's going to be kind of a big deal . Sony will bust out its VR headset . Microsoft will talk DirectX 12 . Valve will talk more about Steam Machines . And Oculus Rift may finally give us a firm release date . Our pants are already wet with excitement . Can you feel them ? Feel them . First up , Valve just threw us a bone in the form of an up-close look at its new and improved Steam controller , which has switched its touchscreen for a bunch of more familiar face buttons . Initial thoughts ? It 's certainly more down the traditional route , but it 's those still-present haptic feedback pads that are the real headline act here anyway . Trust us , you 'll see what we mean when you get your hands on one . And if you 're at GDC next week , the good news is that you 'll be able to - Valve will be showing off its updated controller at the event . But Amazon was n't going to let Valve take all the limelight . To top off the week , pictures of Amazon 's alleged console controller leaked onto the web for our viewing pleasure . We 're a little less enthused about the blocky , somewhat-uninspired design on this one ( Where 's the soul ? WHERE 'S THE SOUL ? ) but that might not be Amazon 's biggest problem . Source Zatznotfunny claims that the gamepad wo n't come bundled with the console , selling as a separate , optional accessory instead . If that 's the case it could seriously limit incentive for developers to build games for the console . The controller design does suggest that Amazon 's set-top box will be about much more than games though , so we 'll just have to wait and see what else is on offer before we pass any hastened judgements . After the `` incident '' that was Aliens : Colonial Marines ( you know what you did , Gearbox ) , we 're exercising every ounce of strength to not become become too excited about Alien : Isolation . But it 's proving f* % king difficult . The game looks better and more terrifying by the day , and the team have just put together a nice behind-the-scenes vid in which they discuss the creation of the game 's alien antagonist . `` He 's hunting you , using his senses , his instincts , to hunt you down and kill you . He 's intelligent , unpredictable and extremely dangerous , and nowhere is safe . '' Finally this week , Titanfall continued to wreak havoc on its path of global domination , and we popped along to the big UK launch . It was a night of heavy mechs , heavy drinking and some light parkour . Even Jonathan Ross showed up for a spot of photobombing .

What appears to be an Amazon Bluetooth gaming controller has just surfaced online , as rumours of Amazon 's set-top box continue to hot up . Two analogue sticks , four face buttons , a D-pad , trigger and shoulder buttons all adorn the Xbox-esque gamepad , but it 's the buttons in the middle of the controller that have caught our eye - those are Android icons . Apart from the bottom-middle one , of course , which looks an awful lot like the Amazon GameCircle logo . On the bottom sit some buttons for media playback - play/pause , rewind , fast-forward - and there are LED indicators for ... something ... on both sides . According to Zatznotfunny , which picked up the pictures from Brazilian regulatory agency Anatel , the controller will be sold as an accessory and wo n't actually come bundled with the box . If true , that suggests Amazon 's box wo n't have gaming as its central focus and will likely be a more rounded streaming system . The gamepad will also be powered by a pair of double A batteries and will allegedly work with Kindle Fire tablets . Our opinion ? It 's not much of a looker . Not much else is known about Amazon 's box for the time being , but given the proliferation of leaks and rumours , we expect we 'll hear something official very soon . Via CVG

Amazon Prime members have begun receiving emails detailing changes to the service that will have them paying 20 % more per year . A year 's subscription to Amazon Prime , which used to cost $ 79 , will now cost $ 99 . Amazon Prime users were notified that the price increase will appear on their next renewal if that renewal takes place after April 17 , an Amazon spokesperson told TechRadar . The yearly subscription price goes into effect March 20 for new members . Amazon is n't exactly apologetic about the change , which it all but confirmed was happening in January , but it did offer some explanation to members . `` Even as fuel and transportation costs have increased , the price of Prime has remained the same for nine years , '' Amazon wrote its email to Prime members . `` Since 2005 , the number of items eligible for unlimited free two-day shipping has grown from one million to over 20 million . We also added unlimited access to over 40,000 movies and TV episodes with Prime Instant Video and a selection of over 500,000 books to borrow from the Kindle Owners ' Lending Library . '' The bookseller has got a point - the value of Amazon Prime has increased immensely over the years . Nobody likes a price hike , but the company 's case is n't without merit . In an announcement on its website , Amazon noted that Amazon Student Prime memberships are also being raised to $ 49 a year , while Prime Fresh memberships will still cost $ 299 a year .

Amazon is rumored to be launching a music streaming service for its Prime subscribers , but it might feature time-limited playback of songs . The online retailer is in negotiations with major record labels that do n't want this `` free '' option to compete directly with subscription-based services , according to the Wall Street Journal . That 's to the benefit of paid services like Spotify , Beats Music and Google Play Music All Access , all of which offer unlimited streaming for a monthly average of $ 9.99 ( £9.99 , AU $ 11.99 ) . Over a year , that 's more than an Amazon Prime subscription , which comes with other benefits like two-day free shipping , Amazon Instant Videos and the Kindle Owners Lending Library . Hence the dilemma . Amazon 's music streaming plans are said to be more akin to Apple 's iTunes Radio service that launched alongside iOS 7 . It 's a promotion-heavy route that encourages users to buy songs eventually . The path could benefit the online retailer , which began selling DRM-free music in 2007 . Of course , it 's not completely altruistic of Amazon to include a music streaming service in its members-only subscription plan . It admitted to wanting to increase the price of Amazon Prime in January . Launching new Amazon Prime features in addition to the price increase would certainly reduce the chance of a mass exodus , though many subscribers are likely to want its various underutilized features split up .

Thanks to a new court decision , unmanned commercial drones are more or less legal for the time being . Unfortunately for the drone industry , it probably wo n't have a field day just yet . A US National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) judge has ruled that the US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) has no legal authority over unmanned drones , which qualify as small aircraft . The judge dismissed a $ 10,000 ( about £6,000 , AU $ 11,000 ) fine that the FAA had leveled against a commercial drone operator . The FAA is the organization that 's been enforcing the ban on commercial drones in the US since 2007 , but with its wings effectively clipped , Amazon and every other company that wants to use the aircraft is technically free to do so . That said , Amazon and the likes of Facebook ( possibly ) probably are n't dumb enough to start flooding the air with drones considering this ruling will inevitably be appealed . In fact , the drone industry is adopting a measured approach in the ruling 's aftermath . `` We are reviewing the decision very carefully and we have also been in touch with the FAA to discuss its implications and the agency 's response , '' Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International President and CEO Michael Toscano said in a statement . He continued , `` Our paramount concern is safety . We must ensure the commercial use of [ unmanned aerial systems , or UAS ] takes place in a safe and responsible manner , whenever commercial use occurs . The decision also underscores the immediate need for a regulatory framework for small UAS . '' Before this decision the FAA was working on writing actual rules for drone operators in the US . Those rules are supposed to be drafted by 2015 , but the appeals process and whatever follows will almost certainly cause delays , and this might end up harming the drone industry more than it helps it .

The wearable tech space is getting a bigger by the day - you need not look further than today 's addition from Acer . With this in mind , it 's no surprise Amazon has opened up a new branch of its internet warehouse just for the burgeoning tech segment . Even without a wearable device of its own , Amazon 's new web storefront is dedicated to smartwatches , activity cameras , wearable cameras and other kinds of wearable tech . The store holds products from all the big wearable names , including Samsung , GoPro and Jawbone , as well as emerging brands like Misfit and Narrative . To help users get caught up with the times , the store also includes a learning center complete with videos to inform buyers of the different categories of wearable tech . `` Wearable technology is an exciting category with rapid innovation and our customers are increasingly coming to Amazon to shop and learn about these devices , '' John Nemeth , director of Wireless and Mobile Electronics at Amazon , said in a release . It 's a smart move for Amazon to catch the wearable wave just as it 's beginning to rise with more mature devices like the Pebble Steel and Samsung Galaxy Gear 2 . Now the question is whether Amazon has any interest in producing a wearable of its own . So far , we have n't heard any wrist- or other-worn rumblings from the e-tailer . However , given Amazon recently rumored activity in the phone space and the introduction of its own Fire TV streaming and gaming box , Amazon is expanding into to all sorts of new technological avenues . Wearables seem like a logical next step .

Well it was probably only a matter of time , but Amazon has dropped in-app purchase functionality for the Comixology iOS app and halted purchases through Google Play within the Android app . The wildly popular digital comics app was snapped up by Amazon for an undisclosed fee earlier this month and the firm has wasted no effort in giving the app the Kindle treatment . The app updates , released this weekend , are designed to ensure Amazon will not have to fork over 30 per cent of every purchase made through the apps to Apple and Google . However the move makes things less convenient for iOS users , who will now need to buy Comixology.com website before downloading to mobile devices . Android users must sign up to the new PayPal or credit card payment system , as opposed to Google Play , before they can continue purchasing from within the Comixology app . As if to compensate , the app update also offers a $ 5 ( around £3 , AU $ 5.40 ) credit for all existing users . In a statement Comixology 's VP of Communications and Marketing Chip Mosher told Engadget : `` As we move to complete the acquisition with Amazon , we are shifting to the web-based purchasing model they 've successfully used with the Kindle , which we expect will allow us to strike the best balance between prices , selection and customer experience . '' Mosher pointed out that iOS users can easily add the web store to their device 's homescreen , while claimed purchasing through the site would offer additional benefits such as access to web-only bundles .

We 're still not sure if an Amazon Phone actually exists but there 's word that if and when it launches , the device will come with a special data deal called Amazon Prime Data . In a similar way to the 3G Kindle giving you free 3G to download books and browse the web , sources kind of familiar with Amazon 's plans told BGR that the data bundle could see users able to use certain Amazon apps for free . That could potentially include Kindle downloads , Prime Instant Video streaming and access to your music and films in Amazon 's Cloud Locker , although we would n't be surprised to see a cap on some of these . Either that , or Amazon may have negotiated a subsidised contract rate with networks which gets you a lower monthly fee along with the handset . All that BGR 's sources know for sure is that something called Amazon Prime Data exists : at this point , it could be anything . Except , perhaps , something that 's likely to be available outside the US at launch .
Rule number one of launching a new streaming set top box : check if there is a porn-streaming set top box that has already baggsied the name . A company called WREAL , which operates a porn-streaming website called FyreTV as well as selling a set top box called FyreTV for the watching of said grumble on your TV , is suing Amazon over the similarly-named Fire TV box . Porn . Lawsuits . Stupidly-spelt words . At least Roku only has one of these problems . Via Mashable Everyone needs to stop suing each other and just read blips :

Apple CEO Tim Cook 's explained that he no longer labels to the Apple TV as a `` hobby '' box because of its growing hardware sales and the amount of content people are buying directly from the set-top box . He revealed that total Apple TV sales have reached 20 million units only when confronted by a question about the Amazon Fire TV and its newly announced HBO Go content deal . `` If I look broadly at the content on Apple TV , I think it compares extremely favorably to the content that is on the Amazon box , '' Cook said during today 's quarterly conference call . `` We 've sold now 20 million of the Apple TV . We 've got a pretty large install base there and I feel quite good about that business and where it can go . '' The `` where it can go next '' reference may hint at the long-rumored Apple iTV , though the set-top box is reportedly due for a Siri-incorporated fresh before the year is out . In addition to touting the 20 million figure in the face of a question about the Amazon Fire TV , Cook said that the video streaming rival `` got a deal for older content '' from HBO . Indeed Amazon Prime subscribers only get access to select HBO shows and earlier seasons of still-running series . An HBO Go app is also coming to Fire TV at later date while it 's on Apple TV right now . An even more impressive number came from Apple 's iTunes account growth . It now sits at 800 million , most of which have credit cards attached to the account , according to Cook . The Apple CEO said he was already pleased with content sales through the set-top box , so he should be even happier when more of these existing iTunes account holders finally spring for an Apple TV .
Amazon has announced that a large chunk of HBO 's extensive and high-quality content library will be coming to its Prime Instant Video unlimited streaming service on May 21 . The company also announced that the HBO Go streaming app will be coming to Fire TV later in the year . The streaming app was notably absent from the streaming box at launch , despite its long-standing availability on Chromecast , Roku and Apple TV . Until now , HBO has resisted licensing its content to any third party services , instead offering it exclusively to HBO subscribers through on-demand cable or the HBO Go streaming app . The announcement intensifies the ongoing battle between Amazon Prime and Netflix . Both companies have put a premium on locking down exclusives and creating their own original content such as House of Cards ( Netflix ) and Alpha House ( Amazon ) . The new multi-year deal will bolster Amazon 's content lineup with unlimited streaming of shows including The Sopranos , Six Feet Under , The Wire , Big Love , Deadwood , Eastbound & Down , Flight of the Concords , Enlightened , and Treme , along with mini-series such as Band of Brothers and John Adams . Many of HBO 's comedy specials and documentaries will also be available . Amazon subscribers wo n't get everything with this deal . HBO will continue to reserve the most recent three years of its programming for subscribers only , meaning no Game of Thrones or Girls yet . However , early seasons of Boardwalk Empire and True Blood will be available at launch . To this point Netflix has been the favorite in terms of content lineup and been dominant in terms of subscriptions . Adding HBO content is power move for Amazon , as viewers without a cable subscription are unable to buy HBO Go a la carte , which has historically put its content out of reach for cord cutters . Access to this programming could be a key driver for people to invest in Amazon Prime subscriptions , which also includes free two-day shipping from the retail behemoth .

The long-rumored Amazon phone will reportedly sport enough sensors to rival Microsoft 's Kinect , and those sensors will enable some unique forms of interaction . The Amazon smartphone will feature four infrared cameras on its front so it can effectively track the position of users ' faces in relation to the display , according to BGR , which spoke with `` multiple trusted sources '' on the matter . Perhaps even more revolutionary than this set-up will be the Amazon handset 's tilt controls , which may aim to make the large phone ( 4.7 inches , according to whispers ) easier to use with one hand . It seems these tilt controls will not only replace existing essential functions , but also create new features , like revealing extraneous but helpful information without requiring touch interactions . For example , tilting the Amazon phone in the maps app might reveal Yelp ratings for any visible restaurants . Or tilting the phone could reveal labels beneath icons in apps where they are n't normally present , in case you forget what a button does . The tilt gestures would be present in Amazon 's included first-party apps , of course ; tilting in Amazon 's video store could reveal IMDB ratings , and moving the phone on Amazon.com product listings might flip between photos . However , the new controls might also cause menus that previously would have been accessed with a tap to slide onto the screen when the phone is tilted in the corresponding direction . Tilting could reveal the X-Ray menu in the Kindle app , or a photo pane in the messaging app , or extended forecasts in weather . And really obvious functions - like scrolling up and down in books and websites when the phone is tilted - would be possible as well . There 's one more new feature of note , sources said : the Amazon phone will have special optical character recognition software that can interpret and convert text captured using its rear camera . Using this function you might snap a photo of a business card to have the phone automatically add information to your contacts , or be able to quickly translate signs written in a foreign language . There 's plenty more we 'd like to know about the Amazon phone , but for now there 's no official word . That could change any time , so keep watching for more info .
Amazon has gone from retail giant to unlikely tech powerhouse , with first the Kindle ereader , then the Kindle Fire tablet and now a whole host of products , such as Prime Instant Video and Fire TV set top box . Clearly Amazon is serious about making it big in the consumer technology market and the Kindle Fire was one if its early successes , going a long way to popularising the 7-inch tablet market . Amazon has since brought out a few similarly successful follow-ons , but the most recent two , the Kindle Fire HDX 7 and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 , were both released back in November 2013 . One year on and the company is back with brand-new upgraded version of the HDX 8.9 . It 's not called the Kindle Fire HDX 2 but instead simply Amazon Fire HDX 8.9 . The company has dropped the `` Kindle '' branding this time around , keeping it specifically for its ereader products . The new Fire HDX 8.9 is going head-to-head with the likes of the Apple iPad mini 3 and Google Nexus 9 with Amazon clearly hoping its massive bank of content and exclusive features will give it the edge . Read on to find out all we know about the new versions . Cut to the chase What is it ? Amazon 's next generation top tier tablet When is it out ? November 4 What will it cost ? Starting at £329 , $ 530 for the 8.9-inch slate Amazon 's latest incarnation of the Kindle Fire HDX goes on sale on November 4 for both the Wi-Fi and 4G versions . The company has confirmed that pricing will start at £329 / $ 530 for the entry level model , which is to say Wi-Fi only with 16GB of storage . The price then goes up to £409 / £660 for the 64GB Wi-Fi only model and further to £479 / $ 773 if you add in the 4G connection . If you want the cheaper 4G configuration ( 32GB ) you 're looking at £449 / $ 725 . All the models are already available to pre-order over at Amazon 's site and will begin shipping on November 4 . Although Amazon is n't updating its HDX 7 model , it is continuing to provide the tablet at a lower price point than the new HDX 8.9 . Prices for that device start at £199 / $ 321 . Amazon has kept the 8.9-inch form factor for the 2014 update of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 while the original 7-inch HDX also remains unchanged . Along with the form factor , Amazon has also decided to keep the display specifications as they were in 2013 . The new HDX 8.9 has the same 2,560 x 1,600 resolution and 339 pixel density as last year . We had hoped we might see a Quad HD ( 3,840 x 2,160 ) display from Amazon this year but , alas , it 's not to be . Amazon clearly still feels its enough to compete with the 7.9-inch iPad mini 3 and 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 as it duly notes the HDX 8.9 's display boasts 30 per cent more pixels than Apple 's Retina Display . The current Kindle Fire HDX uses a Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor , but a report from late last year claimed Amazon ordered shipments of MediaTek 's MT8135 quad-core processor for delivery in 2014 , suggesting a MediaTek powered Kindle Fire HDX 2 . In fact , Amazon has stuck with Snapdragon , implementing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 CPU this time around . Like last year 's model , the 805 is a quad-core chip but this time around the speed is upped from 2.2Ghz to 2.5GHz . Amazon is also touting the graphics performance of the new HDX 8.9 , stating it 's a 70 per cent improvement over the previous generation . That 's a claim we 'll put to the test during our full review .

Voice commanding your gadgets is all the rage , and Amazon Fire TV is finding a growing number of services flocking to its spoken-search ranks . Now , it can add another big name to the bunch . Buried within its Q1 shareholder letter , Netflix revealed it expects Fire TV voice search support to land later this year . The streaming service did n't offer any further details or a more specific timeline , but the news has to be heartening to Fire TV owners stuck with a less-than-complete voice search offering . Last week , Amazon announced voice search for Hulu Plus , Crackle and Showtime Anytime would arrive this summer . At the moment , users can only voice search for Amazon content offerings .

Despite many positive early reviews , early adopters of Amazon 's streaming media box have been underwhelmed by many half-baked features including voice search , which will get a little more useful this summer . Amazon just announced three new content partners are working to enable unified voice search on Amazon Fire TV , the e-tailer 's little black box for the living room launched earlier this month . At launch , Fire TV 's coveted voice search feature was limited strictly to Amazon 's own movie and TV show content as well as music videos from VEVO - a shortcoming the company appears ready to start addressing . Starting this summer , Hulu Plus , Crackle and Showtime Anytime will integrate their full catalogs into Amazon 's voice search - and that 's only the beginning of what Bezos and Friends have in store for us . `` We 're excited and energized by the momentum we 're seeing with Fire TV . We 're thrilled to have Hulu Plus , Crackle , and Showtime integrating their full selection of movies and TV shows into Fire TV 's unified voice search , '' said Dave Limp , Vice President , Amazon Devices . While Amazon 's press release Thursday mostly consisted of chest-thumping snippets culled from Fire TV 's more glowing reviews , the web veteran also reiterated its commitment to improving the available content lineup in the months ahead . In addition to previously promised Amazon FreeTime and Amazon MP3 integration with a forthcoming over-the-air software update , Fire TV will soon make it easier for Prime Instant Video subscribers to find movies and TV shows . Gamers will also have something to look forward to with new titles on the way from heavyweights like Telltale Games , Halfbrick and Disney Interactive , while the upcoming Fire TV app will allow smartphone and tablet screens to control the fun as well .

The graphic novel reading experience on Amazon 's Kindle Fire tablets could be in line for a superhero-sized upgrade after the company announced the purchase of digital comics platform Comixology . Amazon has shelled out an undisclosed fee for the popular Comics by Comixology mobile apps , with a Comixology rep hinting one goal would be improve how the service and Kindle devices work together . Amazon has not discussed its plans for Comixology , which is already the equivalent of a Kindle Store for comic books . However , it certainly adds another string to Amazon 's ever-growing digital content bow . Whether Amazon will fold Comixology titles into the Kindle Store and perhaps even the Kindle Lending Library initiative remains to be seen . Amazon could also look to expand on Comixology 's recently launched self-publishing platform , a medium budding authors have come to rely on with the Kindle Store Comixology has been credited with reinventing comic books thanks largely to its Guided View reading mechanism that offers dynamic shifts between panes . The Comics app sells titles from Marvel , DC and over 75 smaller publishing houses will remain in service in its current form , with Amazon planning to chuck in cash to help the company grow further . While all Comixology readers with Kindles will probably benefit the most from this acquisition , it 'll be interesting to see how much work goes into improving the Amazon and iOS apps from here on in .
Eyebrows were raised when Amazon revealed its Prime Air delivery initiative last year , promising to use commercial drones to deliver small packages within half an hour to major American cities . Was it a publicity stunt conveniently timed to coincide with the holiday sales , or was it fanciful thinking from one of the tech world 's most notorious dreamers ? Well seemingly it was neither . Today , Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told shareholders the octo-copters are not only real , but they 're already multiple generations along . In a letter published to the SEC , Bezos wrote : `` The Prime Air team is already flight testing our fifth and sixth generation aerial vehicles , and we are in the design phase on generations seventh and eighth . '' Previously , Bezos had claimed the future-thinking Prime Air scheme could be airborne within four years . The company must wait for the FAA in the United States to set regulations for the commercial , domestic use of drones , that have traditionally been deployed for military purposes . It also faces several challenges over privacy concerns . Whether Bezos can achieve or , more specifically , will be allowed to achieve his goal is still up in the air , but today 's revelations certainly remove some of the doubt surrounding the sincerity of his intentions . Elsewhere in the letter , Bezos gave himself an assist for the FAA 's ruling to allow the use of personal electronics during take off and landing . He added : `` Our public policy team , with the help of many allies , worked patiently for four years on this , at one point loading a test plane with 150 active Kindles . Yes , it all worked fine !

Amazon 's set-top box might be a little late to the game , but do n't write it off just yet . In fact , there are more than a couple of reasons why Fire TV may not only be able to hold its own against the likes of Apple TV , Chromecast and Roku , but could actually make it a stronger offering than the competition . There 's a lot going on inside Amazon 's mysterious little black box . Alongside a quad-core Qualcomm Krait 300 setup and dedicated Adreno 320 graphics , the company 's also been working hard to address the irks we 've come to hate so much in the video on demand era . It 's even chucked in a dedicated controller to one-up the gaming capabilities of its rivals . Bottom line : we think Amazon 's on to a winner here . Here are 5 ways we think Fire TV could leave its adversaries in ashes .

Having just heard about the of Microsoft 's ambitions for producing original TV content on Xbox , we now understand that Yahoo is set to make a push of its own . The Wall Street Journal reports that Yahoo is planning four 10-episode comedy series , with experienced TV writers and directors jumping on board to help . Each episode will reportedly have a budget of somewhere between $ 700,000 ande a few million dollars This also comes just a few days after rumours that Yahoo is chasing video starts for its own YouTube rival , which is apparently where the new shows will air . If these rumours are true , Yahoo will officially announce the new shows at its April 28 NewFront event – assuming all the t 's have been crossed and the i 's dotted in time .

Amazon has launched a handheld LED barcode scanner , to allow users of its fledgling AmazonFresh grocery service to pick out low-running household items and add them to a shopping list . The Amazon Dash device , which will be distributed freely to Fresh customers , is Wi-Fi enabled and also has a microphone for adding barcode-less items like fruit and vegetables . The idea is for users to carry the dash scanner around the house and pick out items that need replenishing before completing the order online using the AmazonFresh website or smartphone apps . It 's not just household items among the 500,000 available from the AmazonFresh next-day delivery service . The preview video below shows a user ordering guitar strings . Sadly , for the vast majority of interested parties , getting ahold of a Dash scanner will be pretty tricky as the Fresh service is only available in parts of California and Washington State in the United States . Dash itself is only being trialled in LA and San Francisco . The launch is further indication that Amazon is prepared to make significant losses on hardware in order to make the convenience of ordering from Amazon preferable for the consumers . Can the company 's successes with this approach in ereaders , tablets and also most recently with its Fire TV set-top box , give it the upper hand over brick and mortar grocery stores ? Via Engadget
TechRadar 's just come out of a weird , trace-like state . There was a totem with an eye on it . A ghost . And people with crow heads that would NOT stop squawking at us . Meet Monument Valley , a perspective-shifting adventure that would get M. C. Escher 's blood pumping . Packed with levels that deceive and puzzles that challenge but never quite frustrate , it 's short and sweet - you 'll probably complete it in an hour - but Ustwo 's game has got more `` ahhhh '' moments than its asking price owes . Valley puts you in the shoes of Ida , a hat-wearing princess in a surreal landscape , as you twist , bend and rotate your way through 10 3D spatial levels to an enchanting soundtrack . In case you have n't already worked it out , we think it 's rather brilliant . Have we sold it yet ? Just go and play the damn thing already ( if you 're on iOS - an Android version is on its way ) . It 's not every day the humble smartphone bags a game of this calibre . Ok , so onto the bigger news of the week : Amazon Fire TV . We all knew that Amazon 's streaming box would double as a games console , we just were n't certain as to the extent of the company 's gaming ambitions . Though Amazon says it does n't plan to compete with the PS4 and Xbox One ( it even said it 's `` absolutely not a game console '' ) its behaviour still suggests that it 's about much more than simply putting Android games on the TV . For one thing , Amazon Game Studios just hired Far Cry 2 's Clint Hocking and Portal 's Kim Swift . And that comes shortly after it snapped up Killer Instinct studio Double helix . Guys , come on . Then we have the Fire TV gaming controller . It 's not the most inspired design but it actually exists . However Amazon 's decision to offer its gaming controller as an optional extra and not include it in the box does send a message that it 's not ready to go the whole hog yet . Yet . As this part of its business grows , who 's to say what will happen ? But for now , just the very fact it 's claimed a stake in this space will inevitably have ramifications for everyone - Amazon 's entry price is very , very low - and could be the first decent microconsole on the market , given time . Poor Wii U , it has n't had the best of starts . But if anything can revive the ailing console , we reckon it 's Mario Kart 8 . And if it does n't , we 're going to play it to death anyway . The past few months have seen Nintendo teasing tidbits about its Wii U racer , and this week it had a proper splurge with a bunch of sexy new footage . Sure , it 's got all the trappings of another typically superb , glee-filled , throw-the-controller-across-the-room-because-f* % k-that-blue-shell Mario Kart game . But most surprising of all , we found ourselves drooling over just how good it looks graphically . Do n't look so surprised . We certainly were n't the only ones .

Comebacks are funny things . Sometimes you get an Elvis 68 Special or , more recently , Prince doing guerrilla gigs in London . Other times you get Axl Rose , full of pies . So we 've got good news for anyone who feared this year 's Microsoft Build conference would be more Axl than awesome : the Microsoft we 've seen this week is fighting fit and wearing its skinniest trousers . We should have known , because last week 's launch of Office for iPad showed how new boss Satya Nadella is already changing the company : Microsoft wants to be awesome on everything , whether it runs Windows or not . That does n't mean Microsoft is giving up on Windows , of course - and this week we saw the latest moves to undo the damage of the original Windows 8 launch . Build delegates were treated to details of Windows 8.1 Update 1 - Nadella 's new broom clearly has n't reached whoever names Microsoft 's products yet - which runs on more modest hardware , boots directly to the desktop , and should be less annoying for desktop and laptop users . It is n't perfect , but it 's an awful lot better . If Microsoft had shipped it rather than Windows 8.0 , the world might be a happier place . Microsoft 's vision is of a single ecosystem across all kinds of devices , and we saw more of that this week : DirectX 12 graphics and Windows apps are coming to the Xbox One , and the latest Kinect is coming to Windows . For our money the most interesting new technology was Windows Phone 8.1 , which introduces Cortana . Cortana , named after the Halo character , is a very impressive virtual personal assistant that 's a kind of cross between Siri and Google Now . As Michael Rougeau explains , Cortana will be a beta at first but `` Microsoft plans to unleash the full version in the US , the UK and China in the second half of 2014 . '' Windows Phone has a new flagship too : the Nokia Lumia 930 . Michelle Fitzsimmons has the specs : `` It 's packing Windows Phone 8.1 , of course , and features a 5-inch Full HD display . The PureView camera rings in at 20MP . It features optical image stabilization and Zeiss optics . An HD 1.2MP wide-angle camera is affixed to the front . '' Fitzimmons also has the skinny on Windows Phone 8.1 . The new Action Center lets users get notifications from any app and personalisation is a key theme . There are new apps too , including Skype , Calendar and a clever new keyboard called Word Flow - it 's rather like Swype and holds a world record for typing speed . It 's all looking great and will roll out in the next few months . Microsoft 's not the only one with new phone software on the cards : Apple announced the dates for WWDC 2014 to cries of `` iOS 8 ! Mavericks 2 ! iPhones and iPads and iWatch ! '' - tune in on June 2 for the official news . Another giant had new toys to talk about this week , too : Amazon . There is n't a pie Bezos 's blockbuster business does n't want its fingers in , and the latest pie it wants is streaming TV . The new Amazon Fire TV is coming for Chromecast and taking aim at Apple TV . `` It 's elegant , powerful and scary for the competition , '' Scott Alexander says . It 's more powerful than its competitors , it has a massive selection of content - not just Amazon Instant Video , but also Netflix , Hulu Plus and , soon , streaming music - and it 's a games console too . Amazon has clearly been studying the competition . `` Almost every aspect of the Fire TV improving or refines the aspects of the Roku , Apple TV and Chromecast that currently vex consumers , '' Alexander says . `` Roku , Apple and Google are all probably feeling a little nervous today , and with good reason . Jeff Bezos does n't like to compete , he likes to dominate . And this box has the potential to do just that . '' For now it 's US-only , but as Amazon put it : `` We 're a global company with global ambitions , so stay tuned . ''

Amazon announced its app-filled Amazon Fire TV set-top box as a simplified method of delivering movies , TV shows , music and games to your living room television . To that end , it 's a major competitor to video streaming rivals Apple TV , Roku 3 , and Google 's Chromecast , with a few exclusive features that make it stand out from the pack . The world 's largest online retailer promised to improve in three areas : search , performance and the openness of its Android-based ecosystem . Here are a few reasons to consider adding Amazon Fire TV to your already cluttered home entertainment system . Amazon promised to deliver faster search with Amazon Fire TV , noting that typing out a movie title or an actor 's name on a Roku is a slow and tedious process . The wear on our Roku 3 directional pad proves it . Voice search means you do n't have to use a D-pad to hunt down individual letters or even a QWERTY keyboard to misspell a name . Simply talking to your remote searches through the set-top box for what you want and what you need . We already talk to our remotes in an angry voice when it does n't work properly anyway . Amazon Fire TV is late to the game compared to Chromecast and the third-generation Apple TV , but its no slouch when it comes to tech specs . The little set-top box packs capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 8064 System on a Chip with a Qualcomm Krait 300 quad-core to 1.7 Ghz processor as well as a dedicated Qualcomm Adreno 320 graphics chip . That should help alleviate buffering times . The 2GB of RAM should help in the area too . That 's four times as much memory as the 512MB Chromecast , which is probably why Amazon chose the larger set-top box form factor over a streaming stick clone . Amazon is promising thousands of games by next month thanks to notable partners like EA , Disney , Take 2 , Ubisoft , Sega and Gameloft . Minecraft is skipping out on Oculus Rift due to what the developer called its `` creepy '' Facebook acquisition , but the indie game is coming to Amazon 's Android-based set-top box . The company also demoed Asphalt 8 , proving that the racing game can be on every single platform possible , and a Monsters University endless runner game . Amazon Game Studios is also getting in on game development with a tower defense-style third-person shooter called Sev Zero . You wo n't be forced to use the Fire TV remote to play these game either . Phones and tablets are compatible with Amazon Fire TV games . We also got our first look at the Fire game controller . It 's going to be sold separately for $ 39.99 ( about £24 , AU $ 43 ) . Amazon Fire TV wo n't break your bank . Its $ 99 ( about £60 , AU $ 106 ) , which matches the price of the Apple TV and Roku 3 . Chromecast and the new Roku Streaming Stick are cheaper , but their tiny thumb-drive-sized bodies do n't have specs on par with Amazon Fire TV . Best of all , the online retailer hit the sweet spot in terms of cost and it 'll be able to deliver it within two days with free shipping via Amazon Prime .

Microsoft has announced significant price reductions for its Azure cloud service as it attempts to rival Amazon 's dominance in the area . Compute prices will be chopped by up to 35 per cent , while storage prices will be axed by as much as 65 per cent . The reductions mean that Microsoft has either matched Amazon Web Services prices or dropped them even lower . This fulfils a previous pledge to equal Amazon prices . Windows-based Standard A5 is now between 12 to 14 per cent cheaper than Amazon , while the Linux-based version is between 9 and 10 per cent cheaper . There are also reductions in many of its other services . The move is likely to spur Amazon to consider another price drop of its own , and with Google recently slashing prices for its cloud service , there could be a full-on price war . `` We recognize that economics are a primary driver for some customers adopting cloud , and stand by our commitment to match prices and be best-in-class on price performance , '' Steven Martin , General Manager for Windows Azure said in a blog post .

Forget the latest hits , Amazon 's going after the greatest hits with its upcoming music streaming service . Sources chatting to Buzzfeed claim that the rumours that Amazon plans to add music streaming to its Prime service are true . Prime already offers Amazon Prime Instant Video , the Kindle lending library and inclusive express delivery for $ 99 a year ( £79 in the UK ) . But instead of going toe-to-toe with Spotify , Rdio , Deezer , Beats and co , Amazon apparently plans to pick albums and tracks that are over six months old , choosing them based on its users ' buying data . There 's this track called Get Lucky you might want to check out once it launches . Quite a catchy pop song . The sources claim that Prime Music will work across your phone , tablet , computer and other devices , with `` some offline capabilities '' which does n't sound as fully-functioning as Spotify 's offline syncing , for example . It sounds as though Amazon is n't looking to be your average Pitchfork reader 's number one music streaming destination . Rather , it wants to lure the casual music listener into the Prime fold with the promise of other goodies besides .

Is Amazon eyeing up the smartphone game ? With its Kindle range making a big splash in the tablet and e-reader markets and its huge catalogue of online content , a venture into the smartphone fray would be the next logical step for the world 's largest online retailer . In fact , we 're almost certain it is . If recent leaks and industry whisperings are to be believed , Amazon already has a prototype up and running and it 's packing some rather interesting features . An absurd-sounding five ( count it – five ) cameras are thought to adorn the front of the Amazon phone , the belief being that they 're there to introduce advanced 3D gestures and motion tracking capabilities . Sadly , the design we 've glimpsed leaves a lot to be desired , and we think there 's untapped potential for Amazon to make its phone a unique offering in the overcrowded and often same-y market . Here 's TechRadar 's own vision - take note , Amazon .

Amazon Fire TV has barely been out more than a month , and Twitch 's video game broadcasting app has already arrived on the platform . Twitch announced the new app in a blog post . `` Amazon Fire TV just got game ! '' the announcement reads . `` You can now get the Twitch app on Amazon Fire TV and turn your big screen TV into your personal gaming theater . '' The Fire TV version of the Twitch app lets users watch players ' gameplay footage from other platforms , but unfortunately does not let them broadcast gameplay themselves from the device . Twitch users on Amazon Fire TV can browse other users ' channels and view their favorites , but ca n't stream their own gameplay . That 's a bit unfortunate , considering the way Amazon Fire TV is being positioned as something of a gaming platform ( it even has its own game controller ) . In any case , Twitch on Amazon Fire TV was n't fully unexpected , as the service 's icon appeared during Amazon 's announcement of the set-top box , according to a Reddit user . Meanwhile Twitch is also available on Xbox One , PS4 and a score of other platforms . Update : Continuing on the Amazon Fire TV 's gaming bent , Rockstar announced the Grand Theft Auto trilogy is headed to the platform as well as the Kindle Fire . Three titles - Grand Theft Auto III , Grand Theft Auto : Vice City and Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas - are available for immediate download .

Amazon is finally making headway with its Sunday delivery service . Announced last year with only two cities on the docket , Amazon is now expanding deliveries to the following cities : Indianapolis ; Lexington and Louisville , Kentucky ; New Orleans and Shreveport , Louisiana ; Cincinnati and Columbus , Ohio ; Oklahoma City ; Philadelphia ; Dallas , Houston , San Antonio , Austin , Waco and College Station , Texas . Seven days of delivery coming to more towns may have been implemented to sweeten the fact that Amazon Prime has jumped up to $ 99 a year . This comes just after a new shopping service tied into Twitter which makes adding items to your cart practically instantaneous thanks to the addition of a little hashtagging . With the e-tailer giant doing so much lately to perpetuate your shopping addiction , Sunday deliveries are likely to roll out to more cities this year . Via Yahoo
A large group of internet companies , led by some of the biggest names in the business , have taken a stand against new net neutrality rules put forth by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler . Amazon , Google , Facebook , Microsoft , Netflix , Twitter and Yahoo are just some of the cosigners on a short yet sharp letter ( PDF ) to the FCC . `` According to recent news reports , '' the letter states , `` the Commission intends to propose rules that would enable phone and cable internet service providers to discriminate both technically and financially against internet companies and to impose new tolls on them . If these reports are correct , this represents a grave threat to the internet . '' The companies note that instead of `` permitting bargaining and discrimination , '' the FCC 's edicts `` should protect users and internet companies ... against blocking , discrimination and paid prioritization , and should make the market for internet services more transparent . '' The internet companies ' furor comes amidst public outcry against proposed rules that would open internet `` fast lanes '' for firms willing to pay . Those who are n't would invariably be stuck in internet slow lanes . While FCC Chairman Wheeler has maintained he 's on the side of an equal and open internet , even fellow Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said there are `` real concerns '' with his net neutrality proposals and wants to delay the commission 's `` consideration '' of them by at least a month . The rules are set for a vote May 15 , and a Sunshine Period by which the FCC can accept public comment ends tomorrow . Due to the `` torrent of public response '' the proposed rules have elicited , Rosenworcel states more time is needed to collect and consider public input . As of this writing , the FCC 's vote is still scheduled for May 15 . Via Engadget

See something in your Twitter feed that you want to buy but do n't want to leave the comfort of the Twitterverse ? Thanks to a freshly inked deal , you wo n't have to . Starting immediately , you can add items to your Amazon shopping cart by replying to tweets that have # AmazonCart in the message . According to the e-tailer 's site , you simply link your two accounts to `` tell Amazon that # AmazonCart requests coming from your Twitter account should be added to your Amazon.com Shopping Cart . '' You also do n't have to worry about accidentally purchasing anything either since you 're essentially saving items for later , and can always review and remove . If successful , it 's possible you could start seeing a very different way to shop online . A spokesperson from Amazon also told CNET that the system could migrate over to other social networks in the future . However , there 's also the fact that everyone can see what you buy , which may not fly over so well if you 'd prefer a little discretion .

Unlike the Amazon phone 's first alleged public appearance , this time it looks like the handset is n't wearing any armor . True , it 's just a computer-generated render , and not an actual photo , but BGR 's sources maintain it 's real . It does match up nicely with what we 've seen and heard previously , though it should be noted much of that info as of late has been coming from the Boy Genius ' sources . The rumors are coming together to form a picture of a phone that makes up for what it lacks in hardware innovation with a strange new interface and software features . As for the phone we see in the render , it basically looks like an iPhone with the Galaxy S5 's home button . In fact it seems to more closely resemble an older iPhone , like the iPhone 3G , than anything more contemporary . Granted , the Amazon phone reportedly sports some unique tilting , gesture and head-tracking controls , and Amazon will be able to differentiate it with software sold through its own Amazon app store . A previous report said Amazon phone owners will be able to subscribe to a special data plan called Amazon Prime Data , though the details are far from clear at this point . So what if it looks like a Frankenstein monster made of parts from more popular phones that have been out for years ? As has been said many times before , no point in reinventing the wheel . Of course , one has to wonder whether Apple and Samsung , two amply litigious companies who are more than happy to roll around in court battles like pigs in ( you know ) , will feel the same way .

Amazon is reportedly putting the squeeze on book publishers in the UK demanding more favourable terms and the right to print out of stock books using its own equipment According to reports from The Bookseller and the BBC , Amazon wishes to use its own print-on-demand facilities in order to fulfil orders when publishers are n't able to supply their own copies . While that might look a fillip for the consumer seeking to get their hands on an elusive book , they may be getting a lower quality product for their money . The tech can produce books faster than a traditional printing press , but an inferior product is the payoff . Meanwhile , the company is allegedly seeking to force Most Favoured Nation clauses into its deals with publishers , preventing them from offering deals elsewhere unless Amazon is allowed to match them . That would allow Amazon to rival prices even when they appear on the publisher 's own website , according to reports . One UK publisher told the BBC , Amazon was becoming `` increasingly ruthless '' while another flat out accused the retailer of bullying . The controversy comes as Amazon continues to come under fire in the U.S. for its standoff with Hachette with the publisher claiming Amazon is seeking to `` dramatically change terms . '' It is thought there are parallels between the agreements proposed on both sides of the Atlantic . Via The Verge

Update : Contrary to the latest reports , Amazon maintains that its plans are proceeding as normal - and the FAA is backing it up for once . `` This is about hobbyists and model aircraft , not Amazon , and has no effect on our plans , '' Amazon Vice President of Global Public Policy Paul Misener said in a statement sent to TechRadar . `` Our plan has always been to operate as a commercial entity to deliver packages to customers in 30 minutes or less through Amazon Prime Air and this has no effect on that , '' he continued . According to an Amazon spokesperson the confusion stemmed from errors in Ars Technica 's original report . An FAA spokesperson confirmed that , saying , `` The interpretive rule we issued only dealt with hobbyist/recreational drones . The Ars Technica story was inaccurate . '' Original story follows… Word back in March was that the skies were getting friendlier for Amazon 's proposed delivery drones , but the US Federal Aviation Agency has just shot that idea down . A federal judge for the US National Transportation Safety Board had ruled that the FAA actually has no authority to make laws regarding `` model aircraft '' like the ones Amazon wants to use - not without public input , at least - but the agency is fighting back . In a filing published in the US government 's Federal Register on June 23 , the FAA said Amazon is still barred from unleashing its delivery drone army , regardless of what any judge has said . And in the meantime the regulators are appealing that March ruling . As has been pointed out before , the FAA has considered using drones and other `` model aircraft '' for commercial purposes illegal since at least 2007 . That includes `` delivering of packages to people for a fee , '' which might seem to exclude delivering packages to Amazon Prime subscribers , who pay a membership fee but get packages shipped for free . That loophole wo n't hold water , though , as a footnote in the FAA 's June 23 filing notes that `` if an individual offers free shipping in association with a purchase or other offer , FAA would construe the shipping to be in furtherance of a business purpose , and thus , the operation would not fall within the statutory requirement of recreation or hobby purpose . '' Bummer for Amazon , but it 's not like the online retailer is the only commercial entity affected by these regulations . The FAA also singled out such acts as using drones to monitor crops , photojournalism using drones , using them to photograph commercial property , and professional model aircraft stunt-flying ( seriously ? ) as against the law . It 's not like Amazon did n't see these troubles coming - `` putting Prime Air into commercial use will take some number of years as we advance the technology and wait for the necessary FAA rules and regulations , '' reads the Amazon Prime Air website - but the back-and-forth is at least interesting to watch . Meanwhile we 've asked Amazon for its official comment on the FAA 's latest move , and we 'll update here if we get a statement . Via Ars Technica
When Amazon announced the Fire Phone , my initial response was , `` Are you kidding me ? '' I 've been covering the wireless industry for about seven years now , so it 's not a good sign when that 's my first thought . You may already be familiar with the Fire Phone by now , especially since years of rumors and hype preceded its announcement . But if this is your first time hearing about it , you are n't missing much . It 's basically a mid-range smartphone with two big gimmicks : a 3D feature called Dynamic Perspective , and a camera that can scan and recognize products , so you can spend all your money buying those things on Amazon . The latter is called Firefly . My level of frustration with this scam of a phone is so intense that it 's hard for me to put my thoughts down into words , but here 's what I 've got in terms of why you should not buy this phone . You may think it 's an exaggeration to say Amazon is going to be in your face on a daily basis , but if you 're ever owned or used a Kindle Fire HD , or a Kindle Fire HDX , you 'll know exactly what I mean . First , it 's almost pointless to use the Kindle Fire devices without an Amazon Prime account because that 's where you 'll get the most out of the device . Video streaming , premium app downloads and everything else is better when you have Prime . With the Fire Phone , you 're essentially buying a device that 's going to act as your primary tool into the world of Amazon . You 'll be watching multimedia , reading books and buying all kinds of things you probably do n't need because this phone will make it that much easier . Did you just see something you might want to buy , but you are n't sure what it is ? Point your phone 's camera at it and within seconds you 'll be taken to the related Amazon product page , ready for you to hit `` Buy now with 1-click . '' Oh , but before you think this is some kind of revolutionary technology , Google Goggles was doing this years ago . A 720p display ? Really ? In a world where we have 2560 x 1440 smartphones on the high end , and 1080p displays on almost every other phone being released today , Amazon gives us a phone whose primary function is to get you to spend more money on Amazon junk with a 720p display . Oh , but it has four front-facing cameras on it so you can tilt the screen around and peer into a 3D world ! Yawn . That will either get really annoying , really fast , or you 'll disable it for good after about a week . I 'd knock it for having a 2.2GHz Snapdragon CPU , but it probably does n't need much more than that for its very limited selection of apps , running on a tweaked version of Android 4.2 . Yes , it 's ancient . Let 's talk quickly about the Dynamic Perspective . The idea is that with the ability to move the phone around to peer around corners , barriers , walls , edges or whatever is a little ridiculous . It 's just as useful as augmented reality in smartphones . Sure , being able to tilt the phone in a map to see around buildings is neat , but is it necessary to have all those cameras tracking your eyes/face instead of you using two fingers to move around ? It 's a gimmick . Secondly , there 's Firefly . Maybe you see a camera that you like and you ca n't quite make out the make or model . Just scan it with your Fire Phone 's camera and Amazon will tell you what it is , along with a link to buy it - from Amazon . It 's neat if all you ever do is spend all your hard-earned cash on Amazon , but it 's certainly not a new idea . Google Goggles has been doing this for years , perhaps not as elegantly , but its utility and usefulness is pretty limited .

Search engines , social media and text messages are history . The major 'walled gardens ' of the the internet are developing fast , but all of the big four are betting on various visions of the future . Will the next big things be home automation , virtual reality social networking … or something else entirely ? With two-thirds of the world 's population not yet online , what happens next to the internet is truly up for grabs . `` Google is thinking of mobile in a much broader manner , '' says Aaron Goldman , CMO of Kenshoo , and author of Everything I Know About Marketing I Learned From Google . `` It 's not just about phones and tablets . It 's about devices in your home , such as Nest , in your car – such as Waze and Android OS in navigational systems – as well as on your face with Google Glass . '' Last year everyone was obsessed with Google Glass before a collective fear of a loss of privacy took hold . The smart glass now seems destined for a life as a speciality product used as a rather boring work tool , though that has n't stopped a Google Glass 2 going into development . Will it run on Android Wear ? Although Google will release its own smart watch , the master plan behind Android Wear is creating this new operating system , complete with built-in access to Google Now contextual features and voice commands , Google search , and probably Gmail , too . With products due from HTC , Samsung , Asus , Motorola and LG , Android Wear could be a way-in to the future of how we all interact with gadgets . You should also expect a layer of cloud-powered sporty goodness called Google Fit , an app that will provide those all-important stats on steps , heart rate and calories that we all simply must have access to . Or not . Yes , the internet of things is here and Google wants to be part of it . Whether your home and your car run on Android , iOS or something else is a decision that looms in all of our futures . Google 's acquisition of Nest and its smart thermostat and smoke alarm products is more a signal of intent that a concept in its own right . Its Android @ Home initiative is likely to expand into Google Home , or something similar , that creates a smart dashboard for homes . As an app , obviously . Google is covering all of the bases here ; it 's also interested in robotics and artificial intelligence . Google has big money and big plans , and some of them are probably nonsense . There 's a reason Google X , is called the 'moonshot factory ' . On the sensible side comes a Google Maps upgrade : just this month it acquired Skybox Imaging , the company responsible for Google Maps ' images , and Google have also opened talks with Virgin Galactic about getting mapping satellites into orbit . As well as improving Google Maps – something its acquisition of social mapping app Waze is now doing – it could also become part of Google 's drive to increase internet access in rural and remote areas of the globe . So far those ambitions come under Project Loon , a bizarre concept to put a network of Wi-Fi balloons at the edge of space to help fill coverage gaps , and bring people back online after disasters . However , with its purchase of solar-powered drone maker Titan Aerospace it could possibly get off the ground . Other projects to come out of Google X include Calico which focuses on tackling ageing and illness with technology , and a patent application for smart contact lenses with camera sensors embedded inside . It may have tried and failed with its Facebook Home OS layer for Android phones , but there are precious few products and service that Facebook does n't want to offer its 1.28 billion monthly users . By adding voice WhatsApp could be huge across the globe . `` It will disrupt mobile telephony like Skype did . By integrating a platform like WhatsApp into Facebook , the new owners have a real deep-reach into the day-to-day communications of users , '' says entrepreneur and strategist Vikas Shah , President , TiE Manchester . `` WhatsApp was one of the few 'off platform ' ways people did this , and that 's important . '' Facebook is also creating its own version of SnapChat called Slingshot , which could become a valuable mobile business tool . Facebook is also thinking about the next major computing platform . Why else would it have bought virtual reality headset maker Oculus Rift ? `` Unlike mobile , which was not seen as core to the Facebook story , virtual reality is set to be central to its ambitions , '' says Dave Wallace , CEO of digital agency Heath Wallace . `` Imagine being able to step inside a social space , with a virtual representation of yourself , and going to meet others – it certainly has appeal , '' he says . Banking is also in Facebook 's future , with the money transfer market rumoured to be on the company 's to-do list . `` Going after the money transfer market could help Facebook gain access to payment information on a huge number of users while also extending the network 's presence in emerging markets , '' says Patrick Salyer , CEO of social media infrastructure company Gigya . However , he points out that to succeed Facebook will need to find a unique model that differentiates from money transfer providers like PayPal or Western Union . Money transfers are a way of getting people locked-in to Facebook on smartphones , but what if there 's no phone signal ? Cue the Connectivity Lab . `` In most countries Facebook is the internet , '' says Lorry Destainville , Head of Product Development at Glow . `` If users are far from phone relays , Facebook may deploy internet network via drones , so that these users want to start accessing the web . '' File next to Google 's Project Loon . Amazon is no longer just a place to buy books . Its brazen attempt to get people to pay a monthly Amazon Prime fee to use its services seems to have worked ( thanks in part to Amazon Prime Instant Video ) , and we 're on the cusp of Amazon being integral to some people 's daily lives and habits . It cleared-up in the e-books market with its Kindle , but there 's much more emphasis on the Amazon ecosystem in its follow-up Kindle Fire tablets . It 's no surprise that Amazon is putting more of its hardware into the market ; for now we 've got Amazon Fire TV , Amazon Prime Instant Video and – soon – Amazon Prime Music , but what comes next ? Here comes Amazon 's 'missing link ' , the 4.7-inch Fire Phone that 's all about tying-in owners to Amazon services . The Amazon Appstore now hosts 240,000 apps and games available in almost 200 countries , and its first handset will boast a glasses-free 3D screen . That novelty might wake-up the dozing smartphone market , but this is about Amazon popularising its locked-in platform while also breaking free from its website-only retail model . The Fire Phone is a gateway to Amazon 's digital content library , with the likes of the Kindle Store , Audible , Kindle Newsstand and its newly acquired Comixology service embedded . It 's all about popularising Prime ; members will get unlimited streaming access to music , movies and TV . Having taken a chunk of business from high street shops , Amazon now wants to put the postman out of work , too . An air delivery system that would deliver orders in just 30 minutes , Prime Air is a fleet of autonomous octocopters that can deliver 86 per cent of Amazon deliveries – as long as there 's a warehouse 10 miles away . Amazon 's Jeff Bezos has plans to go even higher ; his Blue Origins private spaceflight company has its own hydrogen-fuelled rockets and has ambitions to lower the cost of spaceflight . It could begin to make suborbital flights in 2018 , both for space tourists and astronauts visiting the International Space Station . It 's hard to know exactly what Apple thinks will be the next big thing since it is so massively secretive . But with its trend-setter position gone , Apple is quickly becoming a follower , with its iPhone 5S & 5C split and Apple 's acquisition of Beats the evidence . Apple 's OS X 10.10 Yosemite announcement is small-fry in the world of the Big Four , but the updates to iOS8 and especially iCloud Drive should allow Apple to catch-up with rivals Dropbox and Google Drive . As well as allowing 5GB email attachments called MailDrop , the storage available will be much larger than the current tiny limits . November saw Apple acquire PrimeSense , an Israeli company whose motion tech was used in the first version of Microsoft 's Xbox Kinect . Is this for Apple iTV , the iWatch or a future iteration of the iPhone ?
Years of leaks , rumours , guesswork and quite a few lies-for-attention were put to bed last week , as Amazon revealed the Amazon Fire Phone , a little smartphone friend for the successful Kindle Fire tablet series . Most of the pre-launch excitement from phone nerds quickly disappeared , though , when Amazon 's boss revealed the pricing strategy for the phone 's US launch . There is no 'free with Prime ' option many had hoped for ; it 's a high-cost , high-end model , priced similarly to the top-drawer Samsungs and HTCs of this world . Those hoping for stellar performance on a tiny budget from the delivery logistics specialist were disappointed , while many others were simply confused by Amazon 's baffling head-tracking tools that surely wo n't add much to the phone -- or the buying stuff from Amazon -- experience . As is commonplace on the internet , no one was particularly happy about anything . Beneath a report on the Guardian , reader Naa27 is already predicting some heavy discounting due to the Amazon Fire Phone 's hefty launch price , posting : `` The Fire tablets worked because they were cheap . Not sure why anyone would pay a premium for this . The specs are n't anything to shout about and benefit of the added features are arguable . Be surprised if this succeeds - though less surprised if a huge price cut happens early on . '' And Phaser is n't exactly a fan either , bemoaning the lack of the core Android apps that arrive pre-loaded on the army of other Google-based phones it 's competing with , saying : `` I really do not like Fire OS from trying it on tablets , and this is very expensive for what it is , while missing best in class services like YouTube and Google Maps . None of the other stuff feels very significant to change my mind on that . '' Rakbeast had a business plan for Mr Bezos , but it 's not a particularly kind one : `` They are the least strategic company around , financially successful due to their dodgy tax dealings and their only strength is the online store . They would be best placed buying Argos , instead of making a damn phone . '' Overseas readers should know that Argos is a mainstream household goods shop , where men go to buy last-minute presents for family members and shower curtains . That is therefore perhaps meant as a bit of an insult . On The Register , things were as cynical as usual . Reader R11 wo n't be trying the Fire Phone out no matter how much it 's discounted to by Q2 of 2015 , scoffing : `` Moving your head a lot is typically uncomfortable . Try tilting your head and keeping it at an angle for a minute . To me at least , this user interface sounds exhausting at best , and downright painful at worst . '' He finished his exclusive hands-nowhere-near-it review with : `` I really ca n't think of a worse way to navigate a phone than moving my head . '' Reader JDX came back with some facts , or at least some authoritatively-typed words that appear like they might be proper facts , explaining how bodies work with : `` People move their head constantly when interacting with the real world or talking to people . Whereas sitting still with a fixed , unblinking stare at your screen is proven to be bad for your health . '' And besides , it 's all about the apps anyway , as reader Joe K put it : `` One of the main reasons that WinPho fails for most people is the lack of app store . Amazon 's app store is like a random scattering of apps , some you 've heard of , most you wo n't have , and whose only criteria is their devs who decide to give some money to Bezos . '' The tight integration with Amazon , which even goes so far as to include a physical button to let you scan and buy items , was another sore point for many . Gizmodo reader Dinsy Jones summed up the thoughts of many , with : `` So this whole thing is a tool to get me to buy more stuff from Amazon ... and I have to pay £500 for the privilege ? Right , I ca n't wait to buy one . '' Make sure you buy it via Prime if you 're that excited , Dinsy , it 'll come quicker . In response , reader ScyBy would clearly rather Amazon had announced a £100 budget marvel , agreeing : `` Exactly , it should at least be subsidised . Their tablet offerings stand up as media consumption devices , but this ? I ca n't see why it exists other than to benefit Amazon more than it does the consumer . '' A more aggressive response was offered by Nenslo , who mocked : `` This phone seems completely useless and here I thought Samsung touted useless gimmicks ! '' The most sarcastic comment came via Eurogamer reader Sadakos_fury , who does n't feel particularly empowered by the one-click item barcode-scanning and ordering system that 's built into the Fire Phone . He painted this sad picture of modern-day retail : `` Hold on - so now I can make my way into town , go into a bookshop , scan a book , order it online a bit cheaper , put the book back on the shelf , leave the shop with a happy wave , go all the way home and wait for a few days ( give or take ) for the book I previously held in my hands to drop through the door , all the while enjoying the feel of the one pound seventy-nine that I saved rolling around in my hands ? Amazing . What an age we live in . '' Just you wait until the drones are dropping all your stuff on your doorstep . Then you wo n't want to carry things home like a caveman .

In years to come , we 'll tell our children that Amazon was n't always the only company on earth - and they 'll laugh at us , and make goofy faces when they think we 're not looking . Jeff Bezos 's latest step towards total world domination is an Amazon-powered phone , but is it good enough to rival iPhone 6 ? And will there even be a Nexus 6 for it to face off against ? If only there was a fact-filled weekly missive that could answer those questions and more . Hang on ! There is ! It 's here ! It 's Week in Tech ! We 've had Fire tablets . We 've had Fire TV . Guess what Amazon 's new smartphone is called ? It 's the Amazon Fire Phone . The key USP leaked ages ago - we knew it would use multiple cameras and head tracking to create a glasses-free 3D interface , which so far seems limited to interesting lock screens and some fun map-related tomfoolery . But the Fire also includes Firefly , a camera- and mic-based recognition system that 's designed to let you scan or listen to anything in the world and immediately buy it on Amazon . You can see why Amazon might want that . Will potential smartphone buyers ? We suspect that depends on whether developers embrace the SDK to make their own Firefly-enabled services . The closer we get to the iPhone 6 launch , the more the leaks move from `` unlikely and probably entirely made up '' to `` man , Tim Cook 's going to be annoyed by that one . '' The rumoured sapphire displays are indeed coming , it seems , but they 're only coming to the larger , 5.5-inch iPhone 6 ; the 4.7-incher is getting Gorilla Glass and a significantly lower price tag . The ETA is still September . It 's the battle of the century , a genuine clash of the titans . In the red corner it 's Snapchat , king of messaging in this crazy mixed-up world of ours . In the blue , Facebook , everybody 's favourite potentially Orwellian social network with its new Slingshot app . The battle ? Social image sharing . As Nick Pino explains , Facebook wants to `` shoot Snapchat out of the sky '' - but Snapchat is a moving target . `` Nice fanbase you 've got there , Google appears to be saying . Shame if something happened to it . '' That 's Gary Marshall 's interpretation of the spat between Google and indie record labels , with the big G threatening to boot them off YouTube if they do n't agree to join its imminent streaming music service . With both Google and Amazon playing hardball with suppliers , Marshall fears `` streaming firms refusing to carry particular artists ' products if they do n't do what the streaming service says… Fancy being held to ransom by Jeff Bezos or Sergey Brin ? '' 3D has something of a mixed reputation , largely because it 's often rubbish - so hurrah for IMAX , which promises to revolutionise 3D and provide `` a thrill ride that audiences have n't seen before . '' The secret ? A fabby new 65mm 4K 3D camera that promises to transform 3D movie making . You 'll be able to see the first results in Transformers : Age of Extinction , although sadly the camera ca n't do anything to improve scripts . Good news for footie fans and and haters alike : the World Cup is helping decide the very future of TV . Over to you , Gareth Beavis : from the first colour game in 1970 , `` the World Cup has been a constant proving ground for new technology that affect the way we watch TV every day . '' 4K World Cup footage will be delivered to retailers to help showcase the tech , and if that helps drive 4K adoption that will in turn encourage more 4K content . In the meantime , there 's always 4K Breaking Bad on Netflix . Hands up who thought Nike had abandoned Android ? Us too , so it 's all the more surprising to see the arrival of a FuelBand app for Android 4.3 and above - a whole two years after the FuelBand first went on sale . If athletes took the same approach we 'd still be waiting for the 2012 Olympics to finish . Hands up who thinks LG will make the Nexus 6 ? LG 's hand is conspicuous by its absence , because Google has n't asked it to make the next-gen Nexus . That does n't mean the Nexus 6 wo n't happen - as Hugh Langley points out , HTC is apparently making the Nexus 8 tablet , so Google may have given it the 6 too - but the Android Silver leaks do suggest that the Nexus 's days may be numbered .

Dynamic Perspective looks to be a big selling point of the Amazon Fire Phone , but Microsoft seems to be exploring some hands-free technology of its own . A recently uncovered Microsoft patent describes a system whereby the content displayed to a user changes depending on how far away the device is from their eyes . The obvious application of that is for hands-free zooming , so if you want to zoom in on an image for example then rather than pinching or double tapping the screen you 'd simply bring the phone closer to your face , while holding it further away would zoom out . Now this is just a patent so it may not make it into a finished product and even if it does it would be some way off the level of hands-free control that Dynamic Perspective gives you , but it might just be one piece of the picture . We 've already heard rumours that there 's a Windows Phone handset codenamed McLaren in development which apparently features Kinect-like motion controls , allowing users to interact with games and applications without touching the screen thanks to an array of motion and proximity sensors . Now that really does sound like an alternative to Dynamic Perspective and if Microsoft is planning on putting this hands-free zooming concept into a phone then McLaren would be the ideal candidate and with the handset expected to ship later this year Amazon might have some serious competition before long .
Not only is Amazon forcibly smashing its way into the smartphone market with its Fire Phone today , it 's got BlackBerry singing its praises as well . The Canadian smartphone maker has piggybacked on Amazon 's coattails , announcing that its BB10 smartphones will support the Amazon App Store when BlackBerry releases its 10.3 software update in Q3 this year . That means that BlackBerry Z10 owners will be able to download from the 240,000 Amazon App Store library . With sales of BlackBerry handsets not exactly setting the world on fire - possibly because BB10 is hard to learn - the platform is struggling to attract key apps for its customers . With the Amazon partnership , BlackBerry has an opportunity to expand the company 's software repertoire fairly simply . In the leadup to the 10.3 update , BlackBerry and Amazon will be working with BlackBerry developers to help them migrate their apps to the Amazon App Store . BlackBerry will also be launching a new enterprise application partner program for corporate developers , to develop enterprise level solutions for the company 's corporate customers . Of course , there 's no guarantee this will help move BlackBerry units , although perhaps if it 's coupled with some impressive new hardware , we might start to see BlackBerry return to its former glory .

After being long-rumored to introduce its own smartphone , Amazon has finally unveiled the Fire Phone , complete with a new 3D interface and a helpful information and shopping tool called Firefly . The Amazon phone is counting on these novel features to grab customers , but are they enough to help the device stand out in today 's crowded smartphone market ? Armed with its feisty name , the Fire phone is joining the already frantic fray between the LG G3 , Samsung Galaxy S5 and iPhone 5S . While the Fire is n't equipped with the latest bleeding edge hardware , it offers some enticing features that may draw users away from the safety of Samsung and Apple . Below , we pit key features of the latest smartphone entrant against the more established old guard . Amazon has n't skimped on the industrial build quality of its first handset . Featuring a rubberized frame , Gorilla Glass on both the front and back , CNC aluminum buttons , polished button chamfers , and injection-molded steel connectors every part of this handset should have a tight and precise fit . The Fire is also smaller than most of its competitors thanks to having a more conservative 4.7-inch screen . Overall the Amazon smartphone measures 139.2 x 66.5 x 8.9mm in size and weighs 160 grams . Despite having the second smallest screen of the bunch the Fire is still heavier than even the LG G3 and its 5.5-inch screen . This is likely because the Fire comes with two panes of Gorilla glass , whereas the LG G3 has a lightweight 149g plastic frame measuring 146.3 x 74.6 x 8.9mm . The Samsung Galaxy S5 is made of a similarly lightweight 142 x 72.5 x 8.1mm plastic frame weighing only 145g . The Galaxy S5 also has the honor of being the only waterproof handset with a removable back , allowing users to replace the battery . Despite its metal body , the iPhone 5S is by far the lightest at 112g but also the smallest at only 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm . It 's screen measures a relatively scant four inches . On paper the weakest part of the Amazon Fire Phone is its lacking 1280 x 720 resolution screen . It has the lowest pixel-per-inch density at 315 . Compare that to the 326ppi iPhone 5S and its 1136 x 640 pixel display . On the opposite end of the spectrum , the LG G3 comes with one of the mobile industry 's first QHD displays at an eye-popping 2560 x 1440 resolution and 538ppi . The Galaxy S5 lags behind with a standard full-HD 1920 x 1080 panel and a ppi of 431 . Screen resolution is of course only half the story . The Fire still has a leg up thanks to its display being an IPS panel , which should resolve better-than-average colors . Additionally IPS screens tend to have more generous viewing angles that should help keep the picture clear when users are twisting and tiling the Fire at odd angles when using its 3D interface . Sadly the Fire also comes packing an older generation 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU paired with an Adreno 330 GPU , whereas most of its Android competition - including the Samsung Galaxy S5 and LG G3 - are powered with a 2.5GHz Qualcomm quad-core chip and Adreno 300 GPU . All three handsets , however , come packing the same 2GB amount of RAM . That is , unless users are looking to pick up the 32GB version of the LG G3 with 3GB of RAM onboard . Storage-wise customers can pick up a 32GB version of the Samsung Galaxy S5 to match the lowest level of Fire . Amazon 's handset lacks any mircoSD slot for holding any additional data , though it will be available in a 64GB variant . The iPhone 5S , meanwhile , is in its own older class of hardware using the Apple developed 1.3GHz dual-core A7 chip with 1GB RAM and a PowerVR G6430 GPU .

With anticipation running high for this week 's rumored Amazon smartphone unveiling , interest in all things Amazon is at its peak , making this a perfect time to see what 's coming next . BloombergBusinessweek has offered a glimpse into the top-secret lair where Amazon does most of the R & D work for new hardware such as Fire TV , not to mention a smartphone expected to be announced at a media event on Wednesday . Known as `` Lab126 , '' the facilities are home to more than 1,600 employees , many who have been working there since Amazon founder Jeff Bezos set up the division to create the first Kindle e-book reader back in 2004 . Amazon 's hardware gurus will reportedly return to the Kindle well for a new `` remarkably thin '' version of the Kindle Paperwhite codenamed `` Ice Wine , '' with insiders also dishing on a Square-style credit card reader Amazon may use to shore up its payment business . The report from `` The Everything Store : Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon '' author Brad Stone does n't offer details as to how Amazon plans to slim down the Kindle , instead offering a tantalizing peek into other devices spearheaded by the billionaire CEO . According to loose-lipped employees , Amazon 's rumored smartphone has been in gestation at Lab126 since 2009 , along with other so-called `` science projects '' that include a device capable of projecting computer images onto any surface . Said to be powered by a forked version of Android similar to the company 's Kindle Fire tablets , Amazon 's smartphone will reportedly offer a 3D user interface that uses four infrared cameras to track the user 's face and pupils as they 're looking at the display . Known internally as `` Duke , '' the Amazon handset may wind up an AT & T exclusive at launch thanks to the carrier 's Sponsored Data program , capable of offloading some or all mobile data expenses to a user 's annual Amazon Prime subscription .
Update : It seems one US carrier CEO is n't happy about the possible set-up . Opinionated T-Mobile exec and vocal AT & T critic John Legere took to Twitter to lambast the still-unconfirmed exclusivity of the Amazon phone on the rival network . `` When # big ( @ ATT ) and # bigger ( @ Amazon ) get together , the industry feels a whole lot smaller , '' he wrote . Another gem : `` Exclusivity sucks for customers . Exclusivity on @ ATT sucks for the industry . # justsayin . '' It 's of note that Legere made these comments because he 'd know whether the Amazon phone was coming to his network . Since it appears it 's not , it 's safe to say we can rule out at least US carrier who will be selling the device . Original article below ... It seems all but certain the Amazon phone is almost upon us , but less exciting is word it may come exclusively to AT & T . Ahead of the big launch event on June 18 , The Wall Street Journal has broken the news that AT & T will be the Amazon phone 's exclusive carrier . According to sources familiar with the e-tailer 's plans , the exclusivity agreement is an extension of deal that provides wireless service to Kindle tablets and e-readers . There 's no word on international availability of the Amazon phone , but it 's looking less and less likely it will extend beyond American shores for some time after launch . It 's not the first time the big blue carrier has struck up an exclusive deal . Years ago the original iPhone launched in 2007 and was available only to AT & T customers for over three years . With the Amazon phone AT & T may be hoping to catch the same sort of groundswell of buyers , especially during the current climate of intense competition among wireless carriers - namely T-Mobile . The new smartphone is rumored to be equipped with a unique 3D interface that tracks users with four front-facing cameras . To create the optimal hologram-like experience , the phone will supposedly use low-power infrared sensors to track users ' eyes and faces as well . As we 've previously reported it seems extremely certain we could see Amazon 's new smartphone unveiled Wednesday . Following the big reveal , the handset has been rumored to start shipping by the end of September . Stay tuned to this space as we will bring you all the developments from Amazon .

E3 is n't short for Extremely Exciting Electronics , but it should be : the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo is where we get to find out just what fun Microsoft , Sony and Nintendo have lined up for gamers in the coming months . We 've also got the skinny on Samsung 's new tablet , discovered Amazon 's plans for music streaming , spotted a secret Facebook app and looked at what appears to be the iPhone 6 . It 's the Week in Tech ! The playground chants of `` my dad 's better than your dad '' are back , but instead of dads they 're about games consoles : at E3 we saw the Xbox One and PS4 face each other in the playground , yell a bit and give each other dead legs and Chinese burns . Microsoft showed off all the Halos for Xbox One alongside a new Tomb Raider and - yes ! - a new Crackdown , while Sony showed us a white PS4 , Little Big Planet 3 , Uncharted 4 and - yes ! - legendarily brilliant adventure Grim Fandango , remastered and re-released to delight a new generation of gamers . Sony also introduced what our Scott Alexander described as `` the most important product of E3 2014 '' : the PlayStation TV . Imagine an Apple TV that plays games , a world-class console that 's cheaper than anything else on the market . It could be a game-changer . Nintendo `` is the tortoise to Micro-Sony 's hare , '' Nick Pino says . It 's a shy tortoise too : unlike its rivals , it did n't bother with an elaborate press event at E3 , preferring something much more low-key . It 's got a brand new game to talk about , the steampunk/strategy S.T.E.A.M. , it 's launching Skylanders-style figures and it 's bringing Mii support to the upcoming Super Smash Bros on Wii U and 3DS . These days you 're nobody until you have a streaming music service , and Amazon 's the latest big hitter to go all streamy : its Prime Music service offers a relatively titchy 1 million tracks to US Prime customers and works on PC , Mac , iOS and Android . It 'll no doubt work on the Amazon phone we expect to see next week too . Samsung has unveiled not one , but two Galaxy Tab S tablets : one with an 8.4-inch screen and one with a 10.5-incher . And those screens are n't ordinary LCDs , either . They 're Super AMOLEDs , which means they 're bright enough to give you a tan . Samsung 's ads pronounce AMOLED as `` ahm-led '' , says our mobile expert Gareth Beavis . `` That 's going to get annoying , '' he predicts . The tablets are extremely thin , very light and available in Dazzling White and Titanium Bronze with US price tags of $ 399 and $ 499 , and we 've got the most in-depth review you can possibly imagine . Beavis 's verdict ? `` My legs hurt . '' What 's white and invisible ? That app ! No sooner had Facebook 's Snapchat rival Slingshot appeared on the App Store than it disappeared again . The reason ? Facebook had launched it by accident . An official release is coming soon . Here 's a different kind of three-G : three new G Pads , courtesy of LG . The tablets were `` unleashed '' - now there 's an exciting word - this week in three different sizes : seven inches , eight inches and 10.1 inches . The little one is for `` optimum mobility '' , the big one for `` delivering a media-focused experience '' and the in-between one for swatting wasps or something . Remember Jimmy Lin , the Taiwanese driving and movie star who was waving an iPhone 5C about before it was actually launched ? He 's at it again , and this time he appears to have an iPhone 6 . As John McCann explains , as Lin 's previous leak was spot on , `` hopes are high that he 's managed to repeat the trick this year . ''
As predicted , Amazon is launching a streaming music service into a market that already has eleventy-billion music streamers to choose from . Any doubts that Apple was right to buy Beats headphones should be evaporating : downloads are dying , and the songs of the future will be streamed . That 's bad news for the likes of Thom Yorke , who says that the money musicians get from streaming is pitiful - but it could be even worse news for music fans . Fancy being held to ransom by Jeff Bezos or Sergey Brin ? `` Big businesses are n't nice '' is hardly hold-the-front-page news , but even the most rapaciously capitalist corporations usually try to hide their nasty side from the general public . That does n't seem to be the case with Amazon any more : it 's deliberately messing with book buyers over a dispute with the publisher Hachette , and it 's currently refusing to accept pre-orders for films such as The Lego Movie because it 's in a huff with Warner Bros . That 's big , because Amazon now seems willing to inconvenience its customers if that 's what it takes to win business battles . The issue is n't that Amazon is bad and its rivals good - they 're big firms too , and if you told me that record label executives spend their days kicking puppies or that a publishing house was fitting anti-homeless spikes to the pavement outside its head office I would n't be surprised . The issue is that their disputes could end up affecting you . If music is something you stream , data you rent rather than items you own , then you ca n't be sure that it will be there when you want it - or that it 'll even come to the service you subscribe to . Streaming services promise all the music for little or no money , but as we 've already seen with video the catalogues are n't set in stone : titles are routinely delisted when rights expire or when the services ' priorities change , and studios often refuse to license their content or ink deals that keep their films exclusive to a single service . That happens with music too . We 've already had high-profile Spotify refuseniks such as the aforementioned Radiohead frontman , and now that Dre and Iovine are part of Apple you can be sure you 'll be seeing a lot more iTunes Exclusives in the future . But what 's worrying me is n't the odd exclusive . It 's the prospect of streaming firms refusing to carry particular artists ' ( or more likely , labels ' ) products if they do n't do what the streaming service says . I think it 's case of when that happens , not if , because Amazon is n't the only firm willing to play hardball . Google 's doing it too . According to indie label network WIN ( the Worldwide Independent Network ) , Google is `` directly attempting to strong-arm [ labels ] into non-negotiable contracts '' for its incoming music service `` with the threat of being removed from YouTube '' . Nice fanbase you 've got there , Google appears to be saying . Shame if something happened to it . We called it : Apple and Beats ai n't about the headphones

It 's official - Amazon has entered the music streaming arena . Amazon Prime Music has now gone live , offering Prime customers over 1 million songs to stream . Right now , the service is just available in the US ( we 're chasing Amazon to see when everyone else will get it ) and offers ad-free streaming , curated playlists and unlimited offline playback Prime Music works on iOS , Android , PC and Mac , and you 'll have no cap on the number of times you can play any song . It 's also hitting users with a bunch of curated `` Prime Playlists '' , which have been put together by Amazon 's editorial . If you 're an existing Prime customer you 'll get instant access for no extra cost . If you 're not , there 's a 30 day free trial available . We 're hearing reports that Amazon 's catalog only features songs older than six months , which confirms one of the more recent rumours about the service . Its 1 million-strong library does n't quite compare to Spotify 's 20 million tracks though . The odd thing is , Amazon has n't actually made an official announcement regarding Prime Music yet - it just quietly put it live - so we expect it to go public about the service later today . And what 's that ? Just a week ahead of the launch of the Amazon phone ? What great timing .

Amazon is on the verge of announcing its entry into the music streaming world , but it may not start out as an all-encompassing Spotify beater , according to reports . The New York Times claims the company could launch a `` limited '' service offering thousands ( as opposed to millions ) of songs free to Amazon Prime subscribers as soon as this week . However , the catalogue will apparently be bereft of new releases , current hits and will not have access to the entire Universal Music library . Sony , Warner and smaller independent labels have signed deals with the retailer , but no Universal means no Katy Perry , Lady Gaga , Taylor Swift or Eminem . The proposed service would sit alongside the Prime Instant Video service , which offer Amazon Prime customers thousands of movies and TV shows . The firm recently raised the rates on customers so a music service , albeit a limited one unlikely to threaten the streaming big guns , could sweeten the deal for those enjoying free 1-2 delivery in various territories . The company is planning an event on June 18 where it is likely to unveil the rumoured Amazon smartphone . Perhaps the streaming service will be on board , too ?
Amazon is planning to expand its ever-growing empire to connect customers with local tradespeople according to reports on Tuesday . Reuters brings word from sources claiming a forthcoming breed of Amazon local services will allow users to call in babysitters , painters , plumbers and more . According to the report , the firm plans to test out the scheme in certain markets before it goes nationwide across the US , in much the same way it has with the Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service . The program would muscle in on the turf of services like Yelp as well as traditional brick and mortar stores that are able to earn kickbacks by hooking customers up with local businesses . The Reuters sources claimed Amazon has already started schmoozing with startups in the San Francisco and Seattle areas who 're currently connecting customers with such services . An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the story .

I never thought I 'd be hearing the words : `` Oh my God . Is that THE Amazon phone in your hands ? '' I 've not been this excited about a closed ecosystem since I arrived too early for the Kew Botanical Gardens . The numbers do n't lie - it seems many of you ending up here are wanting to read about the almost-confirmed Amazon phone . I do n't blame you either : what was once a weird rumour that bandied about on the Wall Street Journal and NY Times has suddenly become almost fact - and word is it 's going to be a stormer . While Amazon and others like HTC , Google and Samsung still have some way to go before they get the kind of rabid , slobber dribbling excitement Apple 's unveilings do , credit where credit 's due : I am super intrigued by this thing , and that 's because it 's going to be packing something clever with 3D . We 've been here before with the third dimension , remember . LG gave us a taste a few years back with the Optimus 3D , but it was n't pleasant . The 3D worked - kinda - but only in a separate section of the phone on certain apps and it was enough to induce a headache after too long . And here 's the double fail : the shocking battery that died just as the migraine arrived . It 's pretty telling that nobody has really made any effort since . Until now . Rumour has it that the Amazon phone will have five cameras . Although some will be infrared units , solely for the purpose of scanning your noodle to see which way you 're looking , thus providing you with a true , no glasses 3D experience . And if Amazon does n't cock this up ( *cough* 3DS *cough* ) , Bezos and co are on to a winner . For several reasons : There are few companies that can unveil a technology and be guaranteed that people will buy into it . Apple has that luxury with the devs killing themselves to get to those lucrative iTunes account holders and their cash . If Apple were to bring 3D to the masses , you can bet the developer world would go crazy busy with depth-defying amazement . Unfortunately for Android , it 's not as rosy a picture . Sorry diehards - I love your OS , but the fact is that too much fragmentation means few developers will concentrate on one particular handset . It 's too diluted . Amazon 's Kindle range runs Android but it 's a locked version . A walled garden of iOS proportions - and it is this that gives it security . Developers are not having to shoot into an Android shaped dark space , instead pointing directly at the bullseye of Bezos ' devices ( and one with users ' payment details baked right in - do n't underestimate that draw ) . This will make it easier for Amazon to ensure a consistent experience . What exactly Amazon has up its sleeve here is anybody 's guess . And that 's why it 's so fascinating . Amazon is rising up to become one of the bigger media players , with its access to movie brands and music . If we 're about to finally get something that can deliver movies , games and music at a consistently low price ( plus do it in 3D ) then this could be the phone that I 've been waiting for . The company has nailed the eBook market and has done it successfully ( albeit controversially ) . It could be about to bring something genuinely revolutionary to market here and the beauty is we do n't yet know what it is . Part of the fun is in the guessing - although I ca n't wait for the June 18 to arrive .
From time to time we like to play a game called Ask The Internet . `` Hey , internet ! '' we say . `` What starts with A and is , like , totally doomed ? '' The answer is always `` Apple '' - but we ca n't help wondering whether this week 's WWDC , the most interesting one in years , is going to quieten the howls of doom somewhat . And that was n't the only news this week : Samsung 's giving Tizen to TVs , Valve 's going VR and Amazon 's unveiling something that 's apparently amazing . It 's been a particularly alliterative Week in Tech . The star of Apple 's annual WWDC was n't Craig Federighi 's hair : it was iOS 8 , the latest and greatest version of Apple 's mobile OS . There 's stacks of interesting stuff including third party keyboards , huge improvements to messaging , a really clever feature called Continuity that moves seamlessly from mobile to Mac and back again , and a new app called Health . No sign of the iWatch just yet , but we reckon we spotted plenty of not-so-hidden hints . The news that Apple is calling OS X 10.10 `` Yosemite '' caused a flurry of `` how to pronounce… '' Google searches , but the named-after-the-place-not-the-cartoon-character operating system is much more than a name lots of people ca n't say . There 's ammunition for Apple fans and foes alike , from the excellent iOS integration to what looks awfully like Windows Vista 's Sidebar . To the amusement of everyone on Twitter , Amazon has debuted a video that looks awfully like its customers are seeing their sexy bits for the first time - but the out-of-frame object is n't man or lady parts ; it 's Amazon 's incoming 3D smartphone . We 'll see the Amazon phone for ourselves on June 18 , but you can chortle at the video right here and right now . Alas , poor PSP . The trusty PSP is off to the great gaming graveyard in the sky , with Japanese shipments facing the final curtain this month . It was a lovely bit of kit but it suffered from two fatal flaws : it was awfully expensive , and it was n't a Nintendo . Tech news has a long tradition of printing rubbish blurry shakycam shots and asking `` is this the new New Thing ? '' while readers squint at a torx screw from an alleged iPhone case - but this Nexus 8 leak is a lot less blurry and a lot more interesting as a result . The Nexus 8 will be like a Nexus 7 but one louder , and it 'll probably have improved performance too . More at Google IO later this month . Samsung has been showing off its Tizen-based Smart TV interface , offering a `` sneak peek at something big '' . An SDK for developers is coming in July and Samsung promises that its Tizen TVs will play nice with other Tizen kit such as the Gear smartwatches and the Samsung Z smartphone . Is this the beginning of Samsung 's move away from Android ? Pictures have surfaced of Valve 's new virtual reality headset , which immerses you in imaginary worlds where all kinds of far-fetched things might happen - such as the release of Half-Life 3 . But it apparently is n't for the likes of you or us : Valve 's VR plans are focused around helping other headset developers such as Oculus Facebook .

Update : Blink and you miss it , but one eagle-eyed Google+ user snagged a screen grab of what everyone in the video is gawking at . Aaron Kasten paused Amazon 's vid at just the right moment to reveal a phone-sized black item in the hands of one woman . You can also see the device reflected in her glasses . We obviously ca n't say with 100 % certainty this is the Amazon phone and the device we 'll meet June 18 , but , well , it 's hard to argue otherwise . Keep checking this space for more on the forthcoming Amazon smartphone . Original article below ... It looks like the end to eternal wait for the long-rumoured Amazon phone is finally coming to a close . The e-tail giant is throwing a launch event June 18 hosted by CEO Jeff Bezos , and all signs point to the company 's 3D smartphone hitting the stage . Along with making the event pronouncement on Twitter , Amazon released a YouTube clip featuring `` Amazon customers '' ( most probably actors ) , wowed by a mystery device . The positioning of some of the people 's hands suggest they are holding a phone , and as you can see in the image above , it even makes a flash cameo appearance . One person in the video said it was , `` very real life and incomparable to anything I 've ever seen . '' Others waxed lyrical while moving their heads from side to side as if checking out a glasses-free 3D effect . `` It moved with me , '' one gushed . The actions performed by the gap-jawed video stars also tie in with previous rumours suggesting that intuitive tilting gestures would play an important role in commanding the phone 's user interface . The kind folks who agreed to be part of the video called the experience `` flawless and seamless , '' although we probably should n't read too much into that . At the end of the clip and on Twitter , Amazon pointed viewers to a web form to request an invite to the Seattle event . In other words , the fledgeling flying drone maker is extending the invite to everyday customers as well as journalists and developers . A smartphone launch would end at least two years of speculation regarding Amazon 's entry into the smartphone hardware market . Previous reports have suggested the phone would have a 4.7-inch display , four Kinect-like front loaded cameras capable of tracking the movements and facial features of users . Meanwhile other whispers have raised the prospect of a high-specced device that would cost a fraction of the iPhone 's price tag . Whatever we 're in for June 18 , tune back to TechRadar for up-to-the-minute details .

Amazon 's success in cloud computing might be short-lived as data compiled by the Synergy Rersearch Group shows that Microsoft and IBM are growing at a much faster rate than AWS . The market , worth a cool $ 13 billion ( about £7.67 billion , AU $ 13.8 billion ) , is growing fast at a rate of nearly 50 % year-on-year . SRG figures show that both IBM and Microsoft have gained market share over the past year while that of Amazon Web Services and Google have remained flat . AWS revenues are still far bigger than Microsoft , IBM and Google cloud ( IaaS , PaaS , Private and Hybrid ) combined . Both IBM and Microsoft have also surpassed Salesforce , which now has the slowest growth rate in the top five . John Dinsdale , a chief analyst and research director at Synergy Research Group , said : `` While it [ Amazon ] remains a formidable leader of the market , Microsoft is making some huge strides in IaaS and PaaS while IBM now has clear leadership in the private & hybrid infrastructure services segment . '' Last week , reports suggested that Amazon was on the verge of winning a $ 600m CIA cloud contract to provide a unified platform for all its divisions . Via SRG

Update : We asked Amazon whether fully custom design printing will ever be added to its 3D printing store , and a spokesperson responded that the company is `` always looking for ways to improve the shopping experience and increase the selection of items for customers . '' The spokesperson continued : `` We plan to grow the new 3D Printed Products store and we are evaluating several approaches to better serve end-customers , and our Sellers that are also our customers . Stay tuned ! '' Original story follows… Even if you do n't `` get '' 3D printing , you can still take advantage , thanks to a new Amazon store opening today . The bookseller opened the Amazon 3D Printing Store with no bombast , and now customers can order their own 3D-printed knickknacks straight from Amazon.com . Products are being offered by a wide variety of 3D-printing companies and range from phone cases and dog tags to jewelry , home goods and bobbleheads . Users can customize certain aspects of these goods , often including color , size , shape , and more , but unfortunately Amazon 's 3D printing store does n't currently accept original designs from shoppers . But enterprising would-be 3D printing enthusiasts are n't totally out of luck , as the new Amazon store also lets users order their own 3D printers , parts , equipment , software and guides . And besides , companies like Shapeways already offer that service , so Amazon at least has some competition . `` From futuristic fashion accessories to home decor , this is your source for the gear you need to shop the future , '' the site says . It continues : `` 3D printing is considered the future of print and manufacturing , and is set to dramatically change the way we buy and produce products in the future . '' That much seems certain at this point .
July 28 Update : The Amazon Fire Phone release date has come and gone , so if you 're a US citizen you can up and buy the handset right now . Be sure to check out Page 2 for an Amazon Fire Phone vs iPhone 5S vs Samsung Galaxy S5 vs LG G3 showdown to see which handset is right for you . It 's here ! Meet Amazon Fire , the etailer 's very first smartphone . Anyone out there nail its name ? The Amazon phone is about what we expected on the spec front , but it 's loaded with two features that Amazon claims help users `` see and interact with the world through a whole new lens . '' Those features are Dynamic Perspective and Firefly , which we breakdown further below , plus plenty of details on everything else the Amazon phone has to offer . Perhaps the biggest takeaway from Amazon 's phone event , besides the eye-catching 3D ( which does n't necessarily mean customer-catching ) , is the phone 's heavy ties to buying . Amazon wants you to purchase things , and now it 's come up with a way for you to do so from your pocket . What are your thoughts on Fire ? Is it everything you were hoping for and more ? Or a let-down that ca n't hold a candle to the iPhone 5S , Galaxy S5 or other flagship devices ? Is Amazon simply trying to sell you more stuff , or looking like it legitimately wants to succeed in the smartphone space ? The Amazon phone costs $ 199.99 ( about £117 , AU $ 213 ) for a 32GB version and $ 299.99 ( about £176 , AU $ 320 ) for 64GB . Off contract , Fire costs $ 649.99 ( about £382 , AU $ 691 ) and $ 749.99 ( about £441 , AU $ 798 ) , respectively . The Fire Phone is an AT & T exclusive , and it 's shipping now . Order it on Amazon.com or AT & T.com , or walk into an AT & T store to pick your new handset off the shelves . AT & T customers with a Next early upgrade package can get away with paying $ 32.50/month for 20 months on Next 12 or $ 27.09/month for 24 months on Next 18 for the lesser storage flavor . A 64GB runs $ 37.50/month for 20 months on Next 12 , while a next 18 option costs $ 31.25 for 24 months . As an added bonus , customers who buy the Fire phone are being treated to 12 months of Prime membership free , but the offer is only running for a limited time . We 're still lacking early sales figures , but do n't expect Amazon to panic if its first phone turns out to be a flop . CEO Jeff Bezos told The New York Times : `` We have a long history of getting started and being patient . There are lot of assets you have to bring to bear to be able to offer a phone like this . The huge content ecosystem is one of them . The reputation for customer support is one of them . We have a lot of those pieces in place . It 's our job to keep inventing and to be patient . One thing leads to the next . '' In other words , the pieces are there for long-term success , Bezos believes . It 's just a matter of sticking it out with the phone until it reaches that point . The device features a 4.7-inch screen , a size ideal for one-handed use , said CEO Jeff Bezos . It ranks with 590 nits of brightness and other goodies like an ambient light sensor and Dynamic Image Contrast to make your screen images sing in various viewing situations . The resolution sits at 1280 x 720 with 315ppi . Gorilla Glass 3 is slathered on the front and back , the buttons are made of aluminum and stainless steel details and a rubberized polyurethane grip make for a chic profile . On the inside , the Fire Phone features a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor , Adreno 330 graphics and 2GB of RAM . As expected , the Fire runs a forked version of Android , Fire OS 3.5.0 . As for cameras , we know it 's fixed with a 13MP snapper on the rear , complete with OIS and a powerful f/2.0 lens . There 's even a dedicated camera hardware key - press once to turn it on , twice to take a shot . Amazon is throwing in free unlimited photo storage on Amazon Cloud Drive to sweeten the deal . The front camera - the normal one - is a 2.1MP-er . Both it and the rear camera can capture video in 1080p . Dolby Digital Plus surround sound speakers crank out the Fire Phone 's audio . The Fire phone features global LTE and connectivity on nine LTE bands , four GSM bands and five UMTS . It features 802.11ac support , Wi-Fi channel bonding , Bluetooth and NFC . Note this is regular Bluetooth and not the LE kind that makes for wearable connections . We suspect the device is going to need a lot of juice to run its 3D features , and Amazon only managed to put a 2,400mAh battery in to fuel the Fire . The company said in release notes that the Fire has 285 hours of standby time , up to 22 hours of talk time , up to 65 hours of audio playback and up to 11 hours of video playback . But running Dynamic Perspective and extensive testing is needed to see if these numbers are attainable . Finally , a nanoSIM is pre-installed and the phone has space for a microUSB 2.0 and 3.5mm headphone ports . In the days leading up to the Fire Phone 's release , Amazon made it be known that developers are flocking to flush out the phone 's software offerings . `` In the week following the announcement of the device , the Appstore received more app submissions than any other weeks since it opened in 2011 , '' the company said in a press release , noting developers are taking advantage of the Dynamic Perspective SDK and Firefly SDK in their apps . Companies like eBay , Groupon , Kik , Sega , Trove , TV Guide , the Wall Street Journal and WhatsApp are already using Dynamic Perspective and Firefly , Amazon said . Other apps and games that will be available on the Amazon phone at launch include AirBnB , Angry Birds Epic , Badland , Cut the Rope 2 , FOX Sports Go , The Room Two , ToDoist , Where 's My Water 2 and Wunderlist . The likes of Facebook , Instagram , Pandora , Pinterest , Spotify , Stubhub , Uber and WhatsApp are ready to rumble when the Fire Phone ships , too . Amazon Game Studios is also serving up two Fire Phone exclusive titles in collaboration with other game makers . Saber 's Edge and To-Fu Fury both use Dynamic Perspective as part of their game play , letting users peek around corners and objects inside the game , control gameplay with head movements and tilt the device to change direction or their view . Microsoft made quite a big deal July 22 that Skype is headed to the Amazon Fire Phone . The app will be available at launch and will adopt some of Fire Phone 's flare , complete with a 3D icon and notification badge . Thanks to a carousel widget , users can see chats and notifications at a glance , meaning they wo n't have to launch the Skype app to stay on top of their conversations . The Redmond firm also came out July 24 with word that its OneNote note-taking and to-do list app is now available for the Fire Phone and Kindle Fire tablets . OneNote is free on the Amazon Appstore for Android . Unlike Skype , OneNote for Fire Phone is n't optimized for the device - it 's just the regular Android version available on a new phone . Also available for the Fire Phone is Slacker Radio , a music application . The app uses the Amazon phone 's tilt controls , letting users learn more about a song , find similar artists and access recently played tracks . The Amazon phone screen has an interface called Dynamic Perspective that adjusts a 3D-like view of the screen to match users ' head position . Lockscreens and wallpapers have a 3D effect , though that 's not all . Bezos demonstrated on stage how the device could render a building on a map in Dynamic Perspective . The building - the Empire State , to be exact - was rendered in a three-dimensional sort of way and moved as the user moved . It was a neat trick of animation , though not the reach-out-and-grab 3D of our youth . Neatly , in maps , you can tilt the phone to see what 's `` tucked '' information that lives on another layer , like Yelp ratings and reviews , and see under and around edges . The fun does n't stop there . Fire Phone also lets you one-handed tilt through a line-up of items you may be shopping for , like women 's dresses , in the Amazon Shopping app . You can also auto-scroll through an article , a web browser or ebooks , and tilting in Amazon Music reveals song lyrics . And Dynamic Perspective seems acutely tuned to games , making the images you see on screen pop out and forcing you to maneuver around them just by moving your head . Dynamic Perspective is good at recognizing what 's a human head and what 's not , and there will even be an SDK for the feature so app developers can 3D-ify their games and offerings . Bezos explained onstage in Seattle that in the early days of the Fire Phone , Amazon went so far as to make its own headset to emulate 3D effects . That 's not really practical for real-life , Amazon concluded , which is perhaps a little jibe at Google Glass . To solve the 3D issue , Amazon did indeed stick four front-facing cameras on each corner of its phone . No matter what angle it 's being held at , two cameras will always be facing the user , Bezos claimed . They are of the infrared variety - ultra-low power , Amazon swears - so they work in darkness . The Dynamic Perspective system also relies on four infrared LEDs on the front to compliment the cameras . The Amazon phone is full of little touches , like swipes , to make it easier to use . Bezos and Co. seem very keen to make the Fire Phone as user-friendly as possible , probably hoping to keep their customer satisfaction rankings cozy in their No . 1 slots . Following in line with the Kindle tablets , the phone features a dedicated Mayday button to connect to customer support . It will work over Wi-Fi , 3G and 4G , and is free . Because video is so tied to the Amazon experience , the company has included a number of video features with its first handset . IMDB 's X-Ray is headed to the Fire Phone , and Second Screen lets uses Miracast video from their Fire phone to their Fire TV . ASAP , another Fire TV feature , is also making it to its phone-y cousin . The Kindle Store , Audible , Kindle Newstand and the recently purchased Comixology are accessible on the phone . Taking advantage of Amazon 's digital content library , the Fire provides `` instant access '' to over 33 million songs , apps , games , movies , TV shows , books , audiobooks and magazines . Prime members will get unlimited streaming access to movies and TV episodes at no extra chard . The same sort of deal applies to Kindle Owners ' Lending Library and Prime Music members . An enhanced carousel features `` active widgets '' that show you the last several messages , emails or alerts in your various communication and organization apps . The info pops up right on the home screen and users can deal with it without ever wandering away . Third-party apps can come up with their own uses ; USA Today flashed headlines that are relevant to a user while Zillow popped up property information based on location . The Music app features a `` three-panel design , '' with the left for navigation , the center for various controls and the right with lyrics . Amazon also unveiled something called Firefly . By pressing and holding a dedicated button , the Fire Phone can recognize printed phone numbers , email and web addresses , business cards and much more . Firefly even works at a distance , so you can capture a phone number on a sign from across the street , for example . The idea is to be able to send an email , make a call , save a contact or go to a website without having to type it all into your phone . It does n't stop there though ; Firefly can also recognize songs , TV episodes , art , magazines , movies , music , QR codes and bar codes . iHeart Radio and StubHub build their own apps with the Firefly SDK to make it easier for customers to start a new radio station or find concert tickets . Users can pull up info on items like books or a painting , potentially making it a handy information tool . By the numbers , Firefly recognizes 245,00 movies and TV episodes , 160 live TV channels and 35 million songs . It can supposedly ID 70 million items ( over 100 million all told ) , such as books , DVDs , video games and CDs , and even work around issues like folds , glare and curves . Users can then read product details for these items , add them to their Wish List , and order them on Amazon.com . Translation - it 's easier to buy things with the Fire Phone . Amazon is releasing an SDK for the feature , meaning third-party developers can take advantage of its item-recognition abilities in their apps , too . The SDK is available immediately .
Amazon is reportedly gearing up to launch a mobile credit card reader that would allow stores to take payments using a smartphone . According to internal Staples documents obtained by 9to5Mac , the office and electronics supplier will roll out a device called the `` Amazon Card Reader '' to its US stores starting August 12 . It will apparently go head-to-head with competing card readers from market leaders Square and PayPal and will cost $ 9.99 ( around £5.80 , or AU $ 10.63 ) . Square , which was founded by Twitter co-founded Jack Dorsey , offers its card reader for free but charges a fee between 2.75 % and 3.5 % for each transaction processed . It 's not year clear whether Amazon will also charge a fee per transaction . Amazon recently launched a Mobile Wallet app for Android , which will likely be compatible with the card reader should it turn out to be an actual thing . Despite seeing sales of $ 19.3 billion , the company recently reported a loss for the second quarter , which saw it launch its Amazon Fire smartphone .
Web giant Amazon is about to release a mobile-based credit card reader to rival the likes of Square , according to reports on Sunday . 9to5Mac has obtained a copy of a recent Staples ( an American office supplies store ) inventory , that claims Amazon is planning to launch a device known as the 'Amazon Card Reader ' next month . The internal document says the reader will cost $ 9.99 ( around £5.90 , AU $ 10.60 ) , but adds Staples staff are to hold off on making stock available until August 12 . For those keeping score at home , this is n't the first time such a rumour has manifested itself . Earlier this year the Wall Street Journal reported Amazon was working on a point-of-sale system . Currently Square , founded and operated by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey , dominates the mobile card reader market in the United States , although the PayPal Here rival is also on the scene . Square provides a small , square ( hence the name ) reader to vendors , who can plug them into a smartphone 's 3.5mm headphone jack in order to take credit card payments via an accompanying app . Square takes a small cut of the transaction , but offers a far more cost effective solution for small businesses who do n't wish to invest in credit card machines or pay inflated fees associated with them . However , all is far from rosy in the Square garden after it announced losses of $ 100m earlier this year . Could Amazon capitalise on its perceived weakness ? Amazon is yet to comment on the reports , but with August 12 just around the corner , it wo n't be long until we find out for sure . Via The Verge

Amazon has ventured into YouTube 's territory with a new Video Shorts section that offers over 100,000 free music videos , movie trailers , concerts , interviews and more . However , rather than seeking to sell ads , Amazon is hoping you 'll buy products related to the video you 're watching . So , for example , if you browse to The Beatles Anthology video , there 's a bunch of 'related items ' links attempting to entice you to part with the pennies on Beatles CDs , vinyl LPs and the like . If you watch movie trailers , you 'll be shown links to DVDs , digital downloads and , in the case of Marvel 's Guardians of the Galaxy , action figures . As well as all of that entertainment content , there 's also sections how-to videos based around food , technology and beauty . For example , the video on 'the best coffee maker ' will naturally encourage viewers to buy that item from the side-loaded links Some would say that 's a pretty smart ploy ... Via Variety

Amazon kicked off its own streaming music service , Amazon Prime Music , in June , but critics lamented its limited music library . Now the bookseller is attempting to remedy that by adding hundreds of thousands of songs - no exact figure given , unfortunately - as well as hundreds of new curated Prime Playlists . The new artists being added and artists ' catalogs expanded in this update range from Kendrick Lamar and Skrillex to Nick Cave and Ella Fitzgerald , according to a press release . Makes you wonder , does Amazon need to visit a record store , or does it just order new music from itself ? It 's unclear at this time whether these additions address the main complaint with Amazon Prime Music at its launch : that it only features songs that have been out for six months or longer . We 've asked the company to clarify this point , as well as on exactly how many songs have been added , and we 'll update if we hear back . Nevertheless , `` the response we 've had to Prime Music has far exceeded our expectations and we 're excited to make Prime Music even more valuable for Prime members , '' Amazon VP of Digital Music Steve Boom said in the release . He added that Amazon has received positive feedback regarding Prime Playlists as well . Amazon Prime members in the US have full access to Prime Music , with unlimited plays , offline playback and ad-free streaming on iOS , Android , Windows , OS X , Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire HDX . Plus , you know , all the other benefits of Amazon Prime membership . There 's also a 30-day free trial available for non-Prime members .

The Amazon Fire Phone is just days away from launching and to head off the big release , Amazon has introduced a new digital payment system . The Amazon Wallet quietly launched into a beta on the Amazon app store with limited functionality , at least at the start . Currently users can only store and use loyalty and gift cards from multiple large retail stores and restaurant chains . Users perusing Amazon 's digital shelves can also store their credit card , debit card and checking account information on the app . The Amazon Wallet app is still well behind other digital wallet options like PayPal and Google Wallet . However , this is only a beta and it could be a very early look of what Amazon has planned for its own digital payment system . Amazon Wallet will come pre-loaded on the Fire Phone , but anyone interested in trying it out can download the app from the Amazon App or Google Play Store . One of the most unique ( and somewhat dangerous ) features of Amazon 's Fire Phone is its ability to recognize real-world objects using its camera and then pull a store listing for them . As shopping is an instrumental part of Fire Phone 's experience , more mobile payment options will almost assuredly follow soon . Until then , stay tuned for more news on the Fire Phone as we get closer to its July 25 release date .

Amazon is set to win a $ 600 million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to provide a unified platform for its 17 internal divisions . According to GovExec , not only will that save money for the US taxpayer , it will also help solve some of the issues that brought up the 9/11 terrorist attacks . Hailed by CIA CIO Douglas Wolfe as `` one of the most important technology procurements in recent history '' , the bidding process was marred by controversy . Microsoft , AT & T and IBM all protested to the US Government Accountability Office forcing the CIA either to go to court or to amend the procurement document . To win the contract , Amazon will have to build a cloud within the CIA 's own virtual secure premises , in other words , a `` public cloud built on private premises '' . Deals like that one have helped Amazon become one of the fastest growing software businesses in history according to Bloomberg ( although AWS does n't deal in traditional , client-side software ) . According to Pacific Crest Securities , web services will bring in a whopping $ 5 billion for Amazon , up 58 % year-on-year , almost matching that of VMWare and , at that growth rate , not far from the likes of Dell , IBM and HP . Amazon still derives most of its revenues ( $ 74.45 billion ) from the traditional retail arm of its business but AWS allows it to generate revenue ( and margins ) from a completely different audience - businesses and enterprise . And with web services revenue expected to rise fo $ 6.7 billion in 2015 , one would n't bet against Amazon to become the third-largest server company by the end of the decade .

After it was outed in a leak earlier this week , Amazon 's Netflix for ebooks , titled Kindle Unlimited , is now official and available to use . Kindle Unlimited is a subscription service that will let customers stick their teeth into over 600,000 ebooks and `` thousands '' of Audible audiobooks with unlimited access for $ 9.99 per month . But that 's only a section of Amazon 's entire library , so it wo n't be a total gorge-fest . And if you 're tempted but not entirely convinced then you can give the service a 30-day trial from today . Amazon says you 'll be able to use the service across all Kindle devices and apps . Unfortunately , Kindle Unlimited is restricted to US customers for now , but an Amazon spokesperson has told TechRadar to `` stay tuned '' . So that 's exactly what we 're going to do . Oh , and to help lure you in , Amazon 's also offering up a free three-month Audible membership for Kindle Unlimited subscribers , which will give you access to the fully library of audiobook content .

We kid you not . This is n't the latest season of Star Trek , this is July 2014 - Planet Earth , and Chinese firm Takee has produced the world 's first holographic smartphone . Holographic displays on our mobile devices have been nothing more than a pipe dream , but it appears no longer with some bold claims being made in the company 's promo video . Sporting four front-facing cameras to track eye movement - similar to the quad-cam setup on the Amazon Fire phone - the Takee 1 is able to generate holographic images that float above the display . You can interact with these holograms via a series of air gestures - a wave of the hand here , a pinch of the fingers there . Round the back you 'll find not one , but two camera lenses , allowing you to capture 3D images and create holograms from them to display on screen . The Takee 1 will also apparently let you 3D print scanned images from the rear camera setup . If we 're honest , it does all sound a little too good to be true , and the holographic effects in the video are more than likely computer generated , so it 's unclear how far into development the Takee 1 actually is . Take a look for yourself in the video below and let us know what you make of the Takee 1 in the comments . Via GforGames

Amazon Prime Instant Video , the company 's answer to Netflix , is available on just about every platform under the sun , from games consoles , to smart televisions , computers , set-top boxes , iPad 's and Amazon 's own Kindle Fire range of tablets . But so far Android devices have been left out . That might be about to change , as PC Advisor reports that Amazon Marketing Director Russell Morris told them its arrival on Android was `` imminent . '' Unfortunately he did n't say just how imminent and nor did he shed any light on whether it will be available for both smartphones and tablets . Amazon itself has n't officially confirmed that it 's coming , but a comment from its marketing director seems pretty promising . It 's good news too , as we 'd wager there are quite a few Prime Instant Video subscribers who 'd benefit from an Android app and quite a few other people who might now consider taking out a subscription .

Babak Parviz , the first head of the Google Glass project team , will be joining Amazon . Parviz announced the move in an update to his Google+ profile . In addition to helping create Google Glass , Parviz , a Univ . of Washington Assistant Professor , was a Google X team member who helped the organization develop the first bionic contact lenses . He holds a PhD in electrical engineering from the Univ . of Michigan , and he was a postdoctoral fellow in chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard . Parviz has also been tied to Microsoft . In 2011 , the technology giant funded Parviz 's research at the Univ . of Washington to develop a smart contact lens that could help diabetics monitor blood-sugar levels . Although it is immediately unclear what role Parviz will hold at Amazon , it is likely the e-commerce company is looking to move into the wearables space to add to its burgeoning tablet and smartphone business . However , if Amazon is making a move on wearables , it will be an uphill climb , as Google has an extreme head start in the field . Google Glass 2 is reportedly in development . The company has already improved the original version of Glass by equipping it with 2GB of RAM and a viewfinder designed to help users better frame photo shots . American fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg created a new collection for Google Glass that Google said will make the headset cool . In the enterprise space , Google has partnered with Salesforce to develop a tool designed for businesses to create applications on wearable devices such Google Glass , among other wearables .

Amazon said it was ready for a legal fight over in-app purchases , and now the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) is giving it exactly what it asked for . The commission announced it 's seeking a court order that would force Amazon to give refunds back to customers for unauthorized charges . The court case stems from a complaint dating back to November 2011 that alleged apps purchased from the Kindle store allowed children to purchase coins , stars , acorns and other virtual items . Parents felt they were unfairly forced to pay for charges on their credit card bill made without their consent . `` Even Amazon 's own employees recognized the serious problem its process created , '' FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez charged in a release . `` We are seeking refunds for affected parents and a court order to ensure that Amazon gets parents ' consent for in-app purchases . '' The FTC received a complaint in March 2012 outlining how Amazon had updated its IAP system to only require password entry for purchases over $ 20 . Then in early 2013 , another complaint reported the in-app purchase process required a password while also opening a 15-minute window for the user to buy anything they tapped on . Amazon submitted a letter to the FTC last week warning the commission it would pursue legal action if the commission continued its demands over in-app purchases . The e-tailer argued it 's already put in enough protections to prevent kids from further making unauthorized purchases . However the FTC fired back , noting Amazon did n't change its in-app charge framework until June 2014 . The tweak made it so users could only make purchases with informed consent . The commission claimed the web warehouse only made the change after the FTC decided to file suit . This will be the second case the FTC has pursued in regards to inadvertent in-app purchases . Apple decided to settle with the agency earlier this year , handing over $ 32.5 million to 37,000 customers , rather than pursue a legal scuffle such as Amazon 's current predicament . Amazon claims it 's worked hard to correct the problems with its IAP system and wo n't settle as Apple did . The FTC is just as adamant in its pursuit to see Amazon pay significant fines to refund the customers it 's wronged .
Amazon has unveiled an enterprise storage and collaboration service designed to compete with Box , Dropbox , Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive . The service , Amazon Zocalo , allows users to save , send , and collaborate on documents stored in the cloud . Zocalo users will be able to access the platform via PCs , Macs and most tablet devices , including iPad , Kindle Fire , and Android tablets . Amazon has given IT administrators the ability to integrate the platform with their corporate directories , so that they can monitor how , where and with whom files are shared and stored . Amazon Zocalo is available with a 30-day free trial that offers 200 GB of storage per user for up to 50 users . After the trial , Zocalo will be priced at $ 5 per user per month ( around £2.92 , AU $ 5.33 ) , for 200 GB . Amazon 's main competition in the field is Dropbox , which has been a step ahead of everyone in the enterprise cloud storage space . In April , Dropbox made its storage offering more attractive by providing users with a means of working together on Office documents including Word , Excel and Powerpoint . Earlier in the month , Dropbox made Dropbox for Business available to all users , and it also enabled users to access two different online storage compartments : one for personal use , and one for professional . Box is on the verge of an initial public offering . The company just announced an additional $ 150 million ( around £87.6 million , AU $ 160 million ) in funding , a revenue increase of 94 % in the first quarter for 2014 from the same period in 2013 . However , it also reported having lost $ 38 million ( around £22.2 million , AU $ 40.5 million ) for the quarter an increase of $ 4 million ( around £2.3 million , AU $ 4.26 million ) compared with the same quarter the year before .

Amazon is n't backing down in a fight against the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) . The world e-tailer submitted a letter to the FTC warning the commission it would take it 's case to court regarding a legal spat that stems from a lack of parental controls over in-app purchases ( IAPs ) preventing kids from ringing up tens to hundreds of dollars in faulty charges . To reimburse outraged parents the commission has demanded Amazon pay significant fines . However , the company insists it has already implemented plenty of safeguards to prevent tikes from accidentally unlocking every level in Plants vs. Zombies 2 and other virtual purchases . The web warehouse claims it clearly highlights apps and games that contain IAPs in its Kindle store . What 's more , Amazon says it also sends out real-time notifications and allows users to set parental controls to prevent small hands from inadvertently making purchases . Earlier this year Apple decided to settle in a very similar case with the FTC over circumstantial in-app purchases . Rather than taking the case to court as Amazon plans to , the Cupertino , Calif.-based company forked over $ 32.5 million ( about £18.9 million , AU $ 34.4 million ) to 37,000 customers demanding money back for faulty charges . The iPhone maker also implemented an additional step in the iOS app store to prevent children from buying digital items without explicit parental consent . In Amazon 's letter , the company 's lawyer Andrew DeVore wrote , `` The commission 's unwillingness to depart from the precedent it set with Apple despite our very different facts leaves us no choice but to defend our approach in court . '' The FTC is adamant that Amazon still needs to pay significant fines to repay the `` thousands '' of consumers saddled with charges they never agreed to . Via The Verge
Amazon has added three new instances to its range of cloud-based compute EC2 services . These cater primarily for `` modest demands '' of continued compute power with random , occasional bursts in performance . The cheapest instance ( T2.micro ) comes with one vCPUs with a a baseline performance of 10 % of a single core of an Intel Xeon processor running at 2.5 GHz ( up to 3.3 GHz in Turbo mode ) and 1GB RAM , amounting for 6 CPU credits per hour . Prices start from $ 9.50 ( about £6 , AU $ 11 ) per month or $ 0.013 ( about £0.008 , AU $ 0.018 ) per hour , doubles for the next tier ( T2.small ) and quadruples for the last one ( T2.medium ) . Performance and system memory allocations follow the same trend for those latter tiers as well . CPU credits have a lifespan of up to one day and can be accumulated and used to expedite workloads towards the end of the 24 hour period . Jeff Barr , Chief Evangelist for the Amazon Web Services , said that the new instances provide with better performance at half the cost making it a no-brainer swap . The new T2 instances are likely to be a hit for companies offering cloud-based Office-like productivity applications or other lightweight 2D workloads .

It 's been a week to get the emotions running . Amazon kicked things off by announcing it will be acquiring Twitch , causing a lot of gamers to uncharacteristically take to the internet to express their disapproval . And just as we were reaching breaking point with the ridiculous number of spam videos appearing on our Facebook feeds , Zuck has stepped in to announce he 's going to fix it . And with IFA 2014 just hours away , we discuss the biggest things we hope to see at the big bad Berlin show . Oh , and at one point Marc gets distracted by a fly . This is what happens when he skips breakfast . Facebook spam : where it 's from and how to stop it
In the prudent words of Batman 's nemesis Bane , return to your homes , hold your families close , and wait - Google has begun testing its delivery drones of the future . That might be a tad dramatic , Google 's drones are actually pretty neat . Named Project Wing , the trialing project is being carried out by Google X , G 's top secret research division . The hope is to one day use these drones for delivering goods to our homes . And if this all sounds familiar , it 's because Amazon is doing the same with its Prime Air delivery drones , also in the development phase . But Google 's mini aircraft look a bit more elegant than Amazon 's , sporting wings that span 1.5m in total and four propellers . Google 's been testing the delivery craft in Queensland , Australia , due to the more lax laws on flying robots . The use of commercial drones is pretty restricted in the US at present but Amazon and other parties are lobbying to change that . There 's no guarantee when we might see delivery drones from Google and Amazon actually take off . But as the old saying goes : Shoot for the moon . Even if you miss , you 'll land smouldering in someone 's back garden . Via BBC

Samsung is about to go big on 4K , announcing that it 'll be offering UHD content from Amazon and Netflix very soon . In fact , not only has the Korean company confirmed that it will be bringing 4K Netflix to Europe via its TVs , but it 's confirmed that Amazon 's UHD service will be available starting October . From that month , Samsung 's 4K sets will be able to play Amazon 's UHD content `` globally '' , though it 's not been confirmed how global that will actually be . Netflix has offered 4K content in the US since March , kicking off with its own big TV winner , House of Cards . Amazon announced earlier in the year that it would soon be delivering 4K content via its Prime Instant Video service , and now we know when that will kick off . 4K content is set to keep growing , but this push from Samsung should do its own bit to broaden the market .

Amazon , already the king ( or queen ? ) of the e-commerce jungle , seems poised to pounce on the gaming industry thanks to its recent purchase of popular streaming service Twitch . But where does that leave the beloved gaming site and its fans ? Just barely three years old , and arguably the only streaming site that can stand up to YouTube , Twitch seemed like it was ready to take on the world . So the big question remains : is it a good choice to join up with Amazon ? The short answer ? Yes . It 's always scary when the Goliath buy up growing indie companies , but in the long run , it means the underdog gets a fighting chance in a cutthroat industry overflowing with indistinguishable startups . Honestly , it 's more a matter of time of who buys up who - whether it 's Amazon , or Google or company XYZ , you 'll eventually see all your indie darlings being gobbled up , one by one . Otherwise they 're pretty much stuck in limbo , struggling to maintain a presence . It 'd be a much more beautiful world if we could make a living off accolades , but in reality , we have to suck it up and suit up . There 's always a sense of betrayal when the smaller company accepts a fat wad of cash . It 's selling out . It means change . And change means bad . But only at first . With Amazon 's seemingly endless financial treasure trove , Twitch can give us more services - and there 's nothing wrong with more . Twitch CEO Emmett Shear noted in the PR release that both companies are firm believers in gaming , so it 's not like the core foundation will disappear . Rather , the acceptance of millions of dollars means more gaming related services in the future : `` Being part of Amazon will let us do even more for our community . We will be able to create tools and services faster than we could have independently . '' We 'll have to take that promise with a grain of salt because it 's so early in the game . But know that change is coming , and it 's for the better . Again , it 's unclear exactly what changes we 'll be seeing from the freshly bought company , but it 's possible we might only see drastic changes on Amazon 's site ( more on this in a bit ) and improvement on the Twitch front . Whatever happens , there are bound to be hiccups at first that will probably make you see red - but it 's a learning process ; if we 're to believe both companies ' desire to put `` community and customers '' first , as mentioned in the Twitch town hall , then we have to give it a chance . Realistically speaking , this purchase looks more like Amazon trying to up the ante on its own services than attempting to cannibalize Twitch . $ 970 million ( about £585m , 1,043m ) is all fine and dandy for the streaming site , but Amazon is the one that needs a boost when it comes to video gaming and video streaming - both traditional and non-traditional with the latter . The giant has a decent selection of movies , but of course Netflix ( and even Hulu ) wins that race . With Twitch attached to Amazon , it now has an edge in offering another video service on its site - one that is well-received and continuing to grow . Then you have YouTube , the top dog of internet videos . The acquisition allows a needed separation of the two most popular producers of video content , otherwise we 'd have a monopoly on our hands with Google wearing the crown , and I do n't think anyone wants that . I know I must sound like a corporate shill , but I 'm rooting for the little dude . And if he 's going to partner up with someone with a seedy reputation , at least it 's the lesser of two evils right ? After all , it 's a solid fact that the suits have the money and money makes things happen . It does n't mean the quid pro quo between Amazon and Twitch is n't cringe-worthy . Think about the sinking feeling when Facebook bought Oculus . So far nothing too awful has happened ; Oculus Rift did n't morph into Farmville Rift - and if virtual reality social media happens , it 's not like you 'll be forced to `` plug in '' and use it . I was n't happy with that purchase , but the visibility it gives VR means sacrifices must be made . It 's similar with Twitch ; we want more and we want a great experience to stay amazing . We want Twitch to stay an independent entity , to stick it to the man and survive , but that just is n't feasible . In the end , we 'll just have to wait and see what happens while remembering that it 's better to have something than nothing at all .
Here we go again . Another young , exciting company is being gobbled up by a bigger fish with a flashy amount of cash . We 've already been through this song and dance what feels like an inordinate amount of times this past year , but Amazon buying Twitch is particularly worrisome to me and a move I feel does n't bode well for Twitch or its users . There 's always been something counterculture and subversive about Twitch that 's led me to cheer for it . Kind of an underdog vibe that persisted despite its immense popularity , and it 's probably that vibe that drew in a fair number of its 55 million unique visitors last month . I appreciate how quickly Twitch grew , its upward trajectory in a short three years from Justin.tv spin-off to the fourth largest source of prime time internet traffic in the US . I appreciate the fact that it filled a niche that was , in hindsight , so sorely needed . Twitch has had growing pains , to be sure ; it 's recent decision to mute licensed music in older games was unpopular in its own right , not to mention CEO Emmett Shear 's not-universally loved Reddit AMA to address the situation . Perhaps this is one of the reasons Twitch decided it needed Amazon 's practiced and well-funded hand to get it to the next level . Amazon launched online in 1995 , almost 20 years ago . It 's weathered plenty of storms and suffered through its own aches . Twitch could stand to gain from this experience , not to mention the bucko bucks in Amazon 's rainy day fund . Do n't get me wrong - I understand why a $ 970 million ( about £585m , AU $ 1.04b ) payday and the tutelage/resources/sheer power of Amazon tempted Twitch . It was poised to become Google 's not long ago for more money until those talks reportedly fell apart . That still does n't cut through the disappointment I feel for Twitch or its users who are likely in for some unwelcome changes . The company will remain independent and Amazon has voiced its commitment to helping Twitch `` build new services for the gaming community '' more quickly . For its part , Twitch told TechRadar that the sale to Amazon will `` enable us to accelerate all of the things we want to do for our community . '' More services are great , as is faster delivery . But let 's read between the lines . `` New services for the gaming community '' is an interesting , carefully crafted bit of wording because Amazon does n't necessarily mean more gaming services . It could mean anything , from a marketplace to app store to music service , that 's geared toward people who use Twitch . None of that in its own right bad , but it opens the door for a lot more ads , a lot more user information going to Amazon and perhaps even an adulteration of the very things that make Twitch wonderful for so many people . Another area of concern is Amazon 's bread and butter : selling stuff . The company could n't make a smartphone without including a deep tie-in to its e-commerce business . It 's not out of the realm of possibility for Amazon to , one day , start inserting direct links on Twitch to buy things on Amazon.com . It will already know exactly what kind of games you play and like to watch , who you interact with and when you 're online anyway , right ? Twitch is n't doing anything that countless companies have n't done before it , and again I ca n't fault it for going for the big payday and the big company that can help it realize more than it may have been able to on its own . Who knows how much longer Twitch could have kept growing if it continued to fly solo . But maybe I just ca n't let go of the fantasy of a smaller company making it on its own in the Wild West of the tech world , sticking it out and one day turning into a titan in its own right . I worry that we 'll never have another Apple , Microsoft , Google , Facebook or Amazon if these smaller firms keep selling themselves out . It 's a tough world out there , but someone 's got to make it . Those guys sure did .

Amazon is buying video game streaming giant Twitch , the companies announced Monday . `` Amazon and Twitch optimize for our customers first and are both believers in the future of gaming , '' Twitch CEO Emmett Shear said about the sale . `` Being part of Amazon will let us do even more for our community , '' he continued . `` We will be able to create tools and services faster than we could have independently . This change will mean great things for our community , and will let us bring Twitch to even more people around the world . '' The news comes after The Information and Wall Street Journal reported Amazon was closing in on a deal to acquire the video game streaming firm . The Journal 's initial report had the price of sale at more than $ 1 billion ( about £600m , AU $ 1.07b ) , but according to the release Amazon will buy all outstanding Twitch shares for approximately $ 970 million ( about £585m , AU $ 1.04b ) in cash . In July it was believed Google was set to buy Twitch for $ 1 billion ; all that was missing was official word from the companies . However , talks reportedly went chill over the last several weeks amid possible antitrust concerns , and it seems Amazon swooped in to take Twitch out from under Google 's feet . TechRadar asked Twitch whether users can expect any changes in the company 's offerings with the sale and a spokesman replied : `` It will enable us to accelerate all of the things we want to do for our community . '' In a thank you note to the Twitch community posted to Twitch.tv , Shear said , `` We 're keeping most everything the same : our office , our employees , our brand , and most importantly our independence . '' `` But with Amazon 's support we 'll have the resources to bring you an even better Twitch , '' he continued . Pending regulatory approval , the deal is expected to close in the second half of this year . Amazon offered few details about what the sale means for Twitch or its other services moving forward . However , it did emphasize growth and new offerings . Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said , `` we look forward to learning from them [ Twitch ] and helping them move even faster to build new services for the gaming community . '' Twitch counted 55 million unique visitors in July who lapped up more than 15 billion minutes of content . The firm can hang its hat on one million broadcasters , among them amateur and pro players , publishers , developers , media outlets , conventions and esports organizations . The growth of Twitch from Justin.tv spin-off to the game-streaming giant it is today has been well-documented , and it is impressive for a company that 's just over 3-years-old . Owning Twitch will likely be a boon for Amazon as it continues to break out of its traditional etailer confines . It dove headfirst into hardware with Fire TV and the Fire Phone , and now appears just as serious about getting into gaming , too . You have to wonder though if this will ultimately be good for Twitch users , especially since Amazon relies heavily on , well , selling stuff . The Fire Phone features heavy Amazon purchasing tie-ins ; could Twitch soon sport something similar for games ? Kevin Lee contributed to this report

Barnes & Noble is struggling , but it has a plan to rescue its book selling , ereader making , occasional tablet producing business . It wants to associate itself with smart-thing behemoth Samsung , in an attempt to win some kind of leverage over Amazon in the battle for the digital book market . The result ? Samsung 's Galaxy Tab 4 Nook , a Samsung tablet with a couple of token Nook apps pre-loaded on it and a widget to show off the owner 's digital library . The cynical audience member might suggest this is an opportunity for Samsung to further flog its low-end tablets to those who do n't read and compare spec sheets for three months before buying their gadgets . Plus it benefits the Nook brand by associating it with something more popular than the largely ignored Nook HD tablets . But who wants to read a book on a tablet ? And why would you read a book on a tablet , when tablets come with access to much more interesting 21st century entertainment activities , like watching TV and looking at videos of celebrities having buckets of cold water chucked over them ? On The Register , reader Yet Another Anonymous Coward summarised the pros and cons of the tablet-versus-reader market . The end result was : `` Dedicated ebook tablet = expensive , do n't already own one , poor battery , do n't always carry it , ca n't read in sunlight . Why am I buying this ? '' Dunno , brand loyalty to Samsung ? A present for a child ? Perhaps ereader tablets might take off in the same way home computers did in the 1980s , by promising to deliver serious schooling activities ( look ! It has books ! ) but actually being used for nothing other than games once through the ( bedroom ) door ? In reply , reader Stanislaw says the problems faced by the Nook series is n't to do with B & N 's hardware , but is more of an issue with its software implementation . He posted : `` Seems to me that B & N have misunderstood the problem entirely . The old tablets were fine , really - and the ereaders were excellent . Nope , the real problem is B & N 's woeful attempt at an online store . To say it 's clunky would be being rude to clunky things . It 's slow , it 's ugly , and when you finally give up and go to Google Books or the Kindle store you realise just how poor B & N 's is by comparison . '' Reader Gray has also been scarred by the B & N book buying process , explaining : `` Comparing the B & N site to Amazon 's is like comparing a Trabant [ regarded with derisive affection as a symbol of the extinct former East Germany - Wikipedia ] to a Mercedes . Yeah , you ( may ) eventually get somewhere , but afterward you 'll push the Trabant off a cliff lest you ever be tempted to use it again . '' On the ZDNet comments bit , reader MichaelInMa thinks it might be nothing more than a way for Samsung to clear out a bit of warehouse space ahead of the launch of another batch of 50 different Android models , suggesting : `` Maybe Samsung found a way to dump a lot [ of ] tablets . Reading how well they are doing lately in the world market I will bet they had a lot of left over Wi-Fi only tablets they need to get rid of . '' There are books everywhere in every shop you go in . People must really hate books . Commenter MajorlyCool is happy , though , as he likes to flip-flop between providers and does n't seem to have received the memo saying you have to choose one format and hate all the rest for ever more , posting : `` I 'm happy to see B & N still in the fight . Competition is a good thing and with this tablet you have the freedom to install apps from Google Play , including the Kindle app . That 's been a sticking point for me as I have books from both companies . ''

By all accounts , Amazon 's first foray into the smartphone universe has n't quite set the world on fire , but early adopters are being treated to their first software update . The company kicked off the week by pushing out an over-the-air Fire OS 3.5.1 software update for the Amazon Fire Phone , which promises `` new and enhanced features '' for the e-tailer 's freshman handset entry . The update is also available a manual download via PC or Mac . Fire OS 3.5.1 aims to address some of the initial pain points that have kept the Fire Phone from being all that it can be , starting with the ability to pin favorite apps to the home carousel . The update also includes the option to create folders of apps or other content into app grid Collections , while a double-press on the home button now enables Quick Switch for alternating between or shutting down apps or tasks that are currently running . Fans of Lenticular photos will be overjoyed to discover the Fire Phone can now create such content using 11 still images instead of only three , and the device is newly capable of sharing high-resolution videos via email or MMS as well . Not a fan of Amazon 's built-in email app ? The new Fire OS update will let users delete email missives right from the home screen , meaning one less trip to the app proper when all you want to do is purge some junk mail . Last but not least , the Fire Phone software release notes promise `` dozens of system updates for enhanced battery performance , '' which will probably sound like music to the ears of users who 've struggled to get through the day on a single charge . To download Fire OS 3.5.1 from your Fire Phone , drill down into Settings > Device > Install System Update > Check Now and wait as that little slice of heaven gets installed . Alternately , download the update ( direct link ) on your computer to push it to your device via USB .

Amazon has long been criticised for taking business away from local firms but the online retailer 's latest move – the launch of a mobile card reader - looks to recapture some of that karma . Amazon Local Register , valued at US $ 10 ( around £7 , or AU $ 13 ) , is a secure card reader that 's only available in US for the time being and comes with $ 10 worth of credit towards processing fees when ordered . Amazon 's plans were leaked in the past month when an inventory report showing incoming stock escaped from US-based office stationary supplier Staples . The tiny device connects via the audio port to any Android , iOS or Fire OS devices ( Amazon lists 11 devices including the antiquated Apple iPhone 4 ) . Downloading the app helps convert the smartphone or tablet into a portable cash register that allows better tipping , faster deposits , more powerful reporting , automated sales tax , easy employee setup and simple refunds . As a sweetener , Amazon will cut its charge to 1.75 % for the next 15 months for swiped transactions while offering a flat 2.75 % fee for manually keyed transactions and live phone support . There are no other hidden fees ( chargebacks , refunds or international cards ) and Amazon 's charges are competitive compared to Square and Paypal here . Expect them to react , possibly with more features or lower fees . Amazon stocks Square 's reader as well as Intuit 's mobile card reader and PayAnywhere 's solution .

Not content with beating HBO in subscriber numbers , it looks like Netflix and its video-on-demand brethren are set to get VOD-exclusive original programming from CBS . The maker of CSI and NCIS has revealed that it is looking into delivering original shows for on-demand subscription services , marking a new avenue for the TV studio that 's more at home producing content for its own network . In the company 's earnings call , its CEO Les Moonves hinted at a VOD tie-up , explaining that it `` will be producing more and more shows for more and more outlets , including major streaming companies and other emerging distributors . '' Netflix , Amazon Prime and Hulu - the main VOD players - are no stranger to original programming . Netflix has won accolades with House of Cards , its own production , while Amazon has its own studio set up to create shows for Amazon Prime . And then there 's exclusive programming that bridges both terrestrial and online broadcasting . This can be seen with Extant , the Halle Berry starring sci-fi series . Amazon is currently streaming the show mere days after it premieres on CBS in the US . In the earnings call , Moonves also revealed that the popularity of VOD means the way a show 's popularity is assessed will need to change . `` Many people look at a show like our drama , Elementary , and only see a live plus same-day audience of 9 million viewers on CBS , `` explained Moonve . `` We look at Elementary and see a big audience that grows to nearly 14 million , when you add in 7-day viewing on DVR , VOD and online viewing . `` Clearly , we need to look at the world in a whole new way . What appears to be a moderate hit may actually be a big one . As these trends continue , we will get paid for every viewer bringing in hundreds of millions of new dollars .

It seems Amazon could get into a fight with its own reflection these days . Amid its seemingly endless scraps with book publishers , it 's now sticking it to Disney too . The retailer has halted all Blu-ray pre-orders of Disney movies like Guardians of the Galaxy , Maleficent and Muppets Most Wanted . Instead Amazon is requesting users sign up for alerts when the disc becomes available , but it does appear the firm is allowing fans to pre-order digital copies via the Amazon Instant Video service . The spat , which neither side has yet acknowledged , mirrors an issue Amazon had with Warner Bros. earlier this year when pre-orders were also removed . The falling out follows Amazon 's long-running battle with publishers like Hachette as it seeks the right to lower ebook prices and print books for itself if stocks run out . The firm claims ebook prices are being kept 'unjustifiably high . ' In a statement published at the end of July , the seller wrote : `` A key objective is lower e-book prices . Many e-books are being released at $ 14.99 and even $ 19.99 . That is unjustifiably high for an e-book . `` With an e-book , there 's no printing , no over-printing , no need to forecast , no returns , no lost sales due to out-of-stock , no warehousing costs , no transportation costs , and there is no secondary market -- e-books can not be resold as used books . E-books can be and should be less expensive , '' Amazon wrote . Via SlashGear

Ca n't wait two days to get your online goodies ? Well , Amazon is now expending its same day delivery service to six more major cities . The giant e-tailer announced that its `` Get it Today '' delivery service is now available in Baltimore , Dallas , Indianapolis , New York , Philadelphia and Washington , D.C. As long as customers order their items before noon they could get them within just a few hours . Amazon Prime subscribers pay an extra charge of $ 5.99 for all items . Non-subscribers pay up a $ 9.98 fee for the first item and $ 0.99 for each additional item . The service is available seven days a week , however , Amazon 's full warehouse of online items may not be eligible . The list of items is limited to popular movies releases , video games , electronic cables and accessories , travel needs , back-to-school supplies and family necessities such as diapers and shampoo . `` Imagine how much time you will save now that you can get sunscreen , memory cards , toothpaste , hit movies , text books and HDMI cables all delivered to your home in hours , '' Greg Greeley , Vice President of Amazon Prime said in a release . The service initially launched Get It Today earlier this year to a few select cities including Los Angeles , Phoenix , San Francisco and Seattle metro areas . This expansion is Amazon 's latest step towards asserting complete online shopping dominance . Amazon introduced Sunday shipping to the New York metropolitan area and Los Angeles last November . It seems it 's just a matter of time before Amazon becomes a shipping service unto itself . The world web store already has grocery delivery trucks rolling around in the city of angels and Seattle as part of its Amazon Fresh program .

Flappy Bird , the hit mobile game which caused a bit of a storm when the developer withdrew it at the peak of its success for being too addictive , is back , but right now appears to be an Amazon exclusive . The new Flappy Birds Family game has arrived on the Amazon App Store for Android , promising compatibility with the Amazon Fire TV box , remote and dedicated controller . This time you can get your mates involved as there 's a versus mode to enjoy , while floating ghosts will also obstruct your progress as well as those Mario-esque pipes . Developer Dong Nguyen also promises this version will be a little less addictive than the original . Nguyen , who had sleepless nights over how much time people were spending playing the game , has pledged to offer players satisfaction after a few turns rather than hours of gameplay . There 's no news yet on whether the game will be available for iOS or Android devices .

Amazon Web Services issued a statement that shed more lights on an incident that affected a small but still significant portion of its EC2 customers . Jeff Barr explained that AWS had to apply a `` timely security and operational update '' - as part of XSA ( Xen Security Announcement ) - to a tiny fraction of the global EC2 userbase ( less than 10 % he added ) . While some instances that were patched did n't require any reboot , certain types of updates did require a warm boot , with the system restart keeping them offline for a few minutes . Barr confirmed that automated configuration will be kept intact as should be the case for saved data as well . He acknowledged that it might be inconvenient for some customers but stressed the fact that they thought it was important and time-critical . AWS also confirmed that its APIs and backends wo n't be affected by the BASH bug ( or Shellshock as it is commonly known ) . Those using Amazon Linux wo n't need to worry however , those using other Linux hosts will need to make sure that they have an updated Bash login shell .

Although Amazon has thrown its hat into the tablet , set-top box and smartphone arenas , each type of device shares a common goal : make it easier to buy things from the mothership . This objective could soon expand across the entire home . Reuters reported that Amazon 's secretive Lab126 division is hard at work on the next generation of hardware to help shoppers consume more of the e-tailer 's goods with the push of a single button . According to an unnamed source , the estimated $ 55 million ( about £33.6 million , AU $ 61.9 million ) plans involve development of internet-connected `` smart home gadgets '' capable of notifying consumers when consumables or repairs are needed . They could then order items like laundry detergent with the push of a button . Exactly how Amazon customers might conduct these purchases remains murky , but a second unidentified source claims the e-tailer is interested in some form of wearable device , as well as sensors that could facilitate such technology . Apparently an expansion beyond existing Kindle Fire , Fire TV and Fire Phone hardware , the report claims Amazon intends to beef up engineering staff at the company 's Sunnyvale and Cupertino facilities over the next five years . The sources are in agreement that Amazon 's ambitious plans may never bear fruit , while company spokeswoman Kinley Pearsall offered little insight as to what Lab126 is up to beyond the current 2014 hardware lineup . `` We will continue to invent and create new features , services and products , and to support this innovation , '' Pearsall told Reuters in a statement , adding Lab126 was moving `` incredibly quickly '' while growing at an equally accelerated rate . Unfortunately , the engineering group 's most recent endeavor - the four-year odyssey known as Fire Phone - has thus far failed to live up to hype , with a steep price cut from $ 199 ( about UK£122 , AU $ 224 ) to less than a dollar with a two-year AT & T contract .

You wo n't have to go straight through a carrier if you want to pre-order the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 , as Amazon has just announced its own pre-order dates for the newest phablet . Amazon is taking Galaxy Note 4 pre-orders for $ 300 with a contract starting today for AT & T and Verizon customers and beginning September 26 for Sprint users . T-Mobile fans , it seems , will have to go directly to the carrier , but everyone else using Amazon will have the option to get either the black or white version of the phone . Unfortunately the one thing Amazon has n't been specific about is when the Note 4 will actually ship out , with only a `` mid-October '' expectation . Those hoping to grab the Galaxy Note 4 directly from their carriers have plenty of options as well . AT & T customers can pre-order the Note 4 as of today , with the phone expected to ship out around October 14 . The carrier is selling it for $ 300 on-contract , $ 41.30 or $ 34.42 per month on an AT & T Next plan , or $ 826 without a contract . Verizon 's own Galaxy Note 4 pre-orders are available today as well , with the same price of $ 300 on-contract . T-Mobile pre-orders begin September 24 , with the phone releasing online and in stores October 17 for 24 monthly payments of $ 31.24 . And Sprint has n't yet divulged its own Note 4 pre-order details , though Sprint customers can of course head to Amazon later this month .

Amazon is n't about taking customers on a Voyage these days ; it also wants to light a little Fire , too . The company has outed a trio of Fire tablets , namely a new Fire HD , refreshed Fire HDX and , yes , a Fire tablet for kids . Let 's start from the beginning ; the new Fire HD is available in 6- and 7-inch flavors and five different color options , with the smaller version starting at sub- $ 100 or less than £80 . It 's HD display packs a whopping 1 million-plus pixels and its 1.5GHz quad-core processor helps tasks hum along . There 's a front and rear camera and Dolby Digital Plus Audio , a feature that should help Amazon 's library of 33 million movies , TV shows , books and more pop . Available in 8GB or 16GB configurations , the battery life is pegged at up to eight hours . It also runs Amazon 's latest Fire OS 4 , a.k.a . Sangria , which is built off Android KitKat . Wine and chocolate ? Tasty . The 6-inch version starts at $ 99 ( US $ 125 in Australia with shipping ) or £79 for 8GB while the 7-inch version costs $ 139 or £99 ( AU $ 166 ) . You can pre-order either size now , but their official release wo n't be until October 2 . Amazon 's larger slate , the Fire HDX 8.9 , is getting a sizeable upgrade , namely on the inside . Users will find a 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 8084 chip , Adreno 420 GPU and 2GB of RAM . The graphics engine , by the way , is said to be 70 % faster than before . The tablet also features Dolby Atmos , a first for a tablet , and Dolby Audio for booming sound that Amazon claims is twice as loud as the iPad Air . For another iPad Air jab , Amazon says its 8.9-inch tablet is 20 % lighter than Apple 's model . The Fire HDX is also drinking up Sangria as well as the Amazon Fire Phone 's data and product scanning feature , Firefly . The Fire HDX 8.9 is up for pre-order now starting at $ 379 or £329 with a 4G version available for $ 479 ( £439 ) . There 's no news on Australian price or availability just yet . Finally , just in the US for now , Amazon is introducing a tablet for kids called Fire HD Kids Edition . Inventive , we know . Front-and-center among the tablet 's features is a 2-year guarantee that Amazon will replace it , `` no questions asked , '' during that period . A play for uncertain parents , to be sure . Another thing mom and dad should like is the year of Amazon FreeTime Unlimited , a subscription service that brings kid-centric content to the tablet . The tablet is basically the same as the Fire HD in terms of specs , even down to the size options , except for the kid-proof protective case . The Fire HD Kids Edition starts at $ 149 for a 6-inch and $ 189 for a 7-inch .
Amazon is out to redefine e-readers yet again with the new Kindle Voyage , a thin and light electronic booklet that wo n't break the bank . The Voyage is Amazon 's thinnest to date , measuring 7.6mm and weighing less than 6.4 ounces . The Kindle Paperwhite measured 9.1mm thick and weighed 7.3 ounces , to give you an idea . Retailer listings for the Voyage surfaced earlier in the day , and it turns out it was only a matter of time before this e-reader showed its face . It 's up for pre-order now on Amazon for $ 199 or £169 ( cAU $ 221 ) , and the Kindle Voyage release date is scheduled for October 21 or November 4 in the UK . Utilizing a new Paperwhite display , the Voyage counts 300 pixels ( the Kindle Paperwhite has 212ppi ) in every inch of its 6-inch display . Amazon claimed it has highest marks in three area : resolution , contrast and brightness ( 39 % brighter , thank you very much ) . On-board storage measures 4GB , and you should have plenty of time to read all your titles as a single charge can last up to six weeks . The front light is adaptive , meaning it can be personalized to everyone 's reading light preferences . What 's more , the display will dim after 30 minutes in a darker setting as the human eye eventually gets used to the darkness . The Kindle Voyage comes stacked with a new page turning called PagePress . PagePress makes use of a specialty force sensor located right under the e-reader 's bezel . Rest your thumb on the bezel , and the page will turn as you lightly press down . Haptic feedback lets you know the page is actually turning , and both the feedback vibration and amount of pressure needed to turn a page can be personalized . Amazon is offering free 3G with the new slate as well as a new Origami cover designed just for the tablet . The cheap Kindle also got a touch-up , literally , as it now supports your fingers pressing and swiping along its display . The e-reader also now features a 20 % faster processor and double the storage , up to 4GB . Priced at $ 79 or £59 ( cAU $ 88 ) , the new Kindle is also up for pre-order and will launch October 2 . The Kindle Paperwhite , meanwhile , also doubled up on its storage , probably so it would n't feel left out .

Leaks about upcoming devices can come from all over the internet and sometimes even the manufacturer 's own website . This appears to be the case with Amazon 's German and Japanese stores accidentally listing a new Kindle device , named the Kindle Voyage . The web pages have since been taken down , but they were up long enough for us to glean some interesting facts about the new Kindle . From the information seen while the web pages were still up it appears that a new Kindle device would have a 300ppi ( pixels per inch ) display , up from the 212ppi of the Kindle Paperwhite . With dimensions of 112x116mm and a 8mm thickness , the Kindle Voyager would also be thinner and smaller than its predecessor . Even more interesting is that the pages also hinted at prices , with $ 190 ( around £116 , AU $ 210 ) for the WiFi-only model and $ 250 ( around £153 , AU $ 276 ) for the 3G-enabled device . It also claimed that the release date of the new Kindle Voyage will be November 4 . Giving weight to these leaks is information found on yet another Amazon website , this time the Spanish support page , which had replaced some references to the Paperwhite with the name Kindle Voyage , though these references have since been changed back . It looks like we might not have too long to wait to find out if a new Kindle is being released . Via Engadget

It 's not quite the same as having a full-fledged Spotify app , but owners of Amazon 's little black box can now make beautiful music with their smartphone or tablet in hand . Spotify announced the availability of Spotify Connect support for Amazon Fire TV , which allows the tech companies ' mutual customers to `` enjoy the music together '' without the need to install an app on the media streaming device . Instead of a dedicated app for Fire TV , Spotify Connect takes advantage of the Spotfiy app already on your smartphone or tablet , allowing users to stream potentially millions of songs from anywhere within Wi-Fi range . There is one catch : This mash-up wo n't work unless you have a paid Spotify Premium subscription , which is a requirement of Spotify Connect to begin with . Oh , and you 'll have to be a US resident . `` You can seamlessly switch your favorite music from your mobile to the TV and continue to make calls , use other smartphone apps and go out of Wi-Fi range , all without interrupting the music , '' Spotify explained in a brief blog post . Launched more than a year ago , Spotify Connect offers subscribers a way to hook up to supported hardware from anywhere in the home , as long as the connected speakers are within the reach of a Wi-Fi connection . Amazon Fire TV joins a long list of hardware launch partners already Connect-ing , including Samsung , Revo , Sony , Denon , Yamaha , Panasonic and Pioneer . The set-top requires the latest version of the mobile app in addition to a Spotify Premium subscription . This may not be quite as cool as actually having a standalone Spotify app for Fire TV , but being able to beam millions of songs to yet another piece of hardware in your home without having to pay extra is certainly welcome .
The current dispute – between publishing titans Hachette and Amazon – is , when you get beneath the posturing , really a struggle about technology . The success of 99p ( or free ) eBook pricing is an attempt to exploit Amazon 's recommendation algorithms . The harsh reality is that when it comes to marketing muscle , all publishers – not just Hachette – are virtually impotent against the burgeoning power of these Amazon algorithms . Like the ingredients that give Coca-Cola its distinctive taste , the algorithm details are a closely guarded secret , but this secret sauce is a key reasons for Amazon 's dominant market share and huge book sales revenues . Simply put , these algorithms determine how often a given book is shown to potential customers . If a book 's sales start to increase , its rank goes up and it will get shown to more readers . The faster the climb , the more attention it receives . If the climb stops or slows , the algorithms soon lose interest . Looked at this way , Hachette is n't fighting for authors , book pricing , or product quality , but for survival against a set of computational rules that do n't care who you are or how long you 've been in the business . While we await the outcome of this possibly existential contest for publishing power and control , brand new business models are emerging including book promotion websites . By gaming the algorithms in their favour , such book promo sites help authors and publishers gain audience share while helping readers find the best deals on the books they crave . The more advanced sites match the reader 's detailed reading preferences to similarly granular book classifications , and help readers navigate Amazon 's huge unending supply of free and discount books Ultimately however , these sites – just like the authors , publishers and every other business within the publishing ecosystem – will live or die by their use and mastery of the technology , and right now , the most potent technological force in this struggle for survival is the Amazon algorithms .

Amazon has just updated its app in the Play Store to version 5.0 . While this would n't usually be of much note , this latest update gives users access to Amazon 's entire catalogue of movies and TV on demand . You can download the Prime Instant Video player app through the Amazon Appstore , and once installed , you can browse through a wide range of videos on demand . You can also start watching a video on your Android smartphone , pause it , then continue watching from where you left off on a range of devices such as the Kindle Fire HDX , Amazon Fire TV and the PlayStation 4 . Many videos are free to stream if you have an Amazon Prime account , though there are certain titles that you 'll need to pay extra for to buy or rent . The new update to the Amazon app also includes 5GB of free photo back-up space with Amazon Cloud drive .

Amazon , the e-tailer giant wants to be your online everything . From being the proud owner of Twitch to releasing its own Fire Phone , the company now has a little area on the site where you can buy drones . Yup . Drones . In addition to a broad selection brands including Parrot and DJI , the store features building kits , drone parts and accessories , as well as buying guides , educational tools and safety tips . We can only imagine what 's next ... Fly over here for other buzzworthy blips .
With one of the quickest price reductions in tech history , Amazon 's debut smartphone has gone from meteoric rise to a spectacular flameout back on Earth , where the handset can now be found for less than a US dollar . Amazon today announced that US customers can now purchase a Amazon Fire Phone with 32GB onboard storage for only 99 cents ( about UK£0.61 , AU $ 1.07 ) with a two-year agreement - a steep drop from the initial asking price of $ 199.99 ( about UK£124 , AU $ 215 ) only two months ago . The base model Fire Phone , also available in the US without service agreement for $ 449 ( about UK£279 , AU $ 484 ) , remains locked in an exclusive agreement with AT & T , but still includes a full year of Amazon Prime benefits , a $ 99 ( UK£79 , about AU $ 107 ) value . Amazon also announced Fire Phone is finally heading abroad , where it will be available for £0 on O2 Refresh ( with a £33 tariff ) in the UK , or the equivalent of €1 in Germany on T-Mobile contract with a tariff as low as €35.95 per month . Amazon 's press releases offer no real clues to the reasons behind the steep drop in price so soon after launching Fire Phone , instead reminding the world what an incredible value the device is , especially now that it 's practically free . The 64GB model also received a price cut Monday , dropping from $ 299.99 ( about UK£186 , AU $ 323 ) on contract to only $ 99.99 ( about UK£62 , AU $ 108 ) , although with the 32GB base model selling for a fraction of that price , we do n't see too many takers lining up to spend a hundred bucks on the troubled handset . The discount also applies for early upgraders taking advantage of AT & T Next , where the 32GB model drops from $ 0 down and $ 27.09 per month for 24 months to only $ 18.75 per month , effectively spreading the contract-free price over the next two years . Although Fire Phone has been almost universally panned by critics , Amazon 's US press release serves up six quotes ' worth of gushing praise for the smartphone , all apparently written by a few of the customers who actually paid for the device .
Twitch is on a meteoric rise thanks to the increasing interest in live-streaming videos ( and watching said vids ) . Now that Amazon 's bought the barely three-year old company , you can probably expect to see some changes very soon . Whether these changes are good or bad , is still unclear . You 've already heard our reactions from both sides of the spectrum , though there 's primarily been positive feedback about the acquisition compared to the uproar over Facebook snatching up Oculus . Now let 's hear a bit more from Twitch itself . The company held a quick little virtual town hall the day news broke about the deal but we went one-on-one with Twitch 's PR Director Chase ( just Chase ) to see if we could find out a little more . TechRadar : Can you tell us a little bit more about how Twitch will be a part of Amazon and vice versa ? Chase : The big thing for us is that Emmett will stay on as CEO , we 'll be able to retain our leadership and our culture . Right now the whole thing is about acceleration ; Amazon 's going to help us do what we already do , but do it better and faster . TR : What changes can we expect to see ? Chase : At this point the brands are just getting to know each other . We 're not speaking to the roadmap just yet . What 's really important to us is do right by our community . I do n't think we 're going to be going through any changes that will make people want to get their Twitch-forks out . TR : What can you tell fans to alleviate their fears ? Chase : Amazon has acquired companies before and they 've let them run their companies the way they see fit . So we 've seen the autonomy happen elsewhere so we 're excited to see that happen with us as well . They understand that our company is driven by our community so they [ Amazon ] know they we have to keep doing right by them [ fans ] . TR : Amazon has a big server base . Is this something Twitch is planning on taking advantage of ? Chase : It 's not something we 're speaking to right now but obviously we 'd love to be able to take advantage of the resources they have and hopefully that 's one of the things we 'll see . We talked about acceleration and it could be all sorts of things though we have n't announced anything quite yet . TR : How do Twitch employees feel ? Excited ? Chase : Oh yeah , definitely . There were a lot of other acquisition rumors and when this came about , there was a collective thought that this was great … it was a lot of `` oh , this is cool '' TR : Could Twitch have been able to grow on its own opposed to being bought by a bigger company ? Chase : There are many ways to grow , such as acquisitions , mergers , IPOs , staying private and independent . We chose this acquisition because it was best for us and the Twitch community . Amazon came along at the perfect time since they are a company we have a shared DNA and a shared view on community with … one thing that was very important to Emmett that he made clear months ago when acquisition rumors were surfacing : he said , I 'm never going to let this company be acquired by a company that does n't let us retain our leadership and culture . Twitch is still actively hiring and growing its team , with Chase adding that the company would also like to take advantage of Amazon 's global reach . It seems the glow of being bought by big business is still sinking in with a lot to work out in terms of keeping fans happy .

An Amazon exec has admitted the company fouled-up the pricing of the Amazon Fire Phone , cited as just one of several reasons for its abject failure . Poor financial results saw Amazon 's share price dive by 10 per cent recently , and many have blamed the rather dismal launch of the Fire Phone . Amazon Senior Vice President of Devices David Limp has now admitted that the company failed to price the phone correctly , a contributing element in the Fire Phone 's poor sales performance . `` We did n't get the price right… I think people come to expect a great value , and we sort of mismatched expectations . We thought we had it right . But we 're also willing to say , 'we missed . ' And so we corrected , '' says Limp . In the US , the phone launched at $ 199 for the 32GB model , or $ 299 for the 64GB version . Just two months after release , Amazon chopped these prices down to 99 cents ( yes , really ) and $ 99 respectively . Amazon is yet to release solid sales data for the Fire Phone , but we know it 's not good news . Among the company 's Q3 2014 financial results was a note of $ 83 million worth of Fire Phone stock just sitting in Amazon 's warehouses . In the UK , the Amazon Fire Phone was released at a slightly more sensible price than its US counterpart , but that has n't stopped it from receiving a bucketload of criticism . Scoring two and a half stars in our review , we highlighted issues that included an awkward interface , a relatively low-res screen and a rather gimmicky main attraction . The Amazon Fire Phone uses four front cameras that track your face , making interface elements move in 3D style . It scores pretty highly on the fluff-o-meter . Limp says the company is working on the Fire Phone 's failings , though : `` Each release that we 're doing , we 're learning . Beyond that , I leave it out there to see what people think .

Time to free up an HDMI port , as Amazon announced its Fire TV Stick . Similar in size to Google 's Chromecast and the Roku Streaming Stick , Amazon aims to destroy its competition with better hardware and a stunningly cheap , two-day special offer for Amazon Prime customers . While similar to Chromecast and the Roku Streaming Stick , the Amazon Fire TV Stick tries to set itself apart in a few ways . It 's compatibility with the Amazon Fire TV game controller is nice , opening up a selection of over 200 games to download . ( Of course , that requires the $ 40 standalone cost of the controller . ) Naturally , Amazon Instant Video is available from the get-go , an app sorely missing from the Chromecast . On the downside , the Fire TV Stick is missing HBO Go out of the box , but we might see it on the platform by year 's end . Under the hood of this HDMI stick is a dual-core processor , 1GB of RAM and 8GB of flash storage . These internals Amazon made sure to highlight , as they currently oust the Chromecast and Roku Streaming Stick 's spec sheets by quite a long shot . Releasing just a week before Black Friday , the Amazon Fire TV Stick is available for pre-order right now for $ 39 ( about £31 , AU $ 44 ) . Amazon has n't announced global availability , but we 've reached out and will update with new information as it comes . As a special perk for current Amazon Prime subscribers , you can pre-order the Fire TV Stick for a cool $ 20 for the next two days .

Amazon is one step closer to conquering the living room today after the company announced it has reached over 600 apps and games on the Amazon Fire TV . To put things in perspective , the service launched in the US last April and initially had only about 200 apps and games to choose from . Tripling in size in just six months is an accomplishment , and one that the scrappy set-top box desperately needed . That said , 600 apps is still a drop in the bucket when compared to the thousands found on the Roku 3 . The success in this area is primarily thanks to the partnerships Amazon has forged within the gaming community and the move to base the operating system off Google 's Android architecture , making it easier to port games from one set of devices to the other . Smaller mobile developers from Shiny Box Games ( Dungeon Quest ) and HandyGames ( Ninja Hero Games ) have joined larger developers like TellTale Games ( The Walking Dead ) and 2K ( NBA 2K15 ) to speak on behalf of their successful partnerships with the retail giant . `` For us , it was really important to be on Fire TV because of our beyond-mobile strategy , '' said Chris Kassulke , CEO and co-founder of HandyGames in a press release sent to TechRadar . `` The end-consumer should have access to their games , whether they are on the go or at home in the living room , and is the reason why we optimized all our games for Fire TV . '' We have reached out to Amazon for further comment and will update the story when we hear back .

After a flopping Amazon Fire Phone performance , Amazon is deep in the red . According to the company 's third quarter earnings report its losses have increased to $ 544 million ( about £339m , AU $ 621m ) . That 's 20 times the losses compared to last year 's $ 25 million ( about £12m , AU $ 22m ) operating loss . The major contributing factor for this is undoubtedly Amazon 's recent unsuccessful experiment with the Fire Phone . Amazon Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak noted that the company took a $ 170 million ( about £106m , AU $ 194m ) hit stocking and selling the unpopular phone . Amazon also has $ 83 million ( about £51m , AU $ 94m ) worth of Fire Phone inventory in its warehouses . Amazon has also invested into the development of new products including the Fire TV and Kindle Voyage and a new Amazon Dash barcode reader . Not to mention that giant load of cash it dropped on its recent acquisition of Twitch for $ 970 million ( about £605m , AU $ 1.1b ) . Despite this massive operating loss , Amazon 's net sales saw a 20 % increase with revenue amounting to $ 20.58 billion ( about £12.83b , AU $ 23.49b ) in this third quarter . Despite these numbers , it 's still less than investors were expecting . The big take away from Amazon 's earnings is we 're likely not in for the Fire Phone 2 anytime soon . Given that critics panned the handset and consumers were lukewarm on the device , the likelihood of another Amazon Phone is n't looking good .

Amazon announced today that it 's begun shipping the Kindle Voyage , Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and Fire HD Kids Edition . The bookseller aims to dethrone the Kindle Paperwhite with the Kindle Voyage , which it says is its most advanced reader ever . Objectively speaking , the Voyage is certainly the brightest and the thinnest of Amazon 's book-focused Kindle tablets . Amazon is selling the Kindle Voyage for $ 199 ( £169 , about AU $ 221 ) . The Voyage also has a new customizable page-turning feature that lets you flip forward and provides haptic feedback when you press lightly on the Kindle 's bezel . An Amazon spokesperson informed TechRadar that the retailer also began shipping two new Kindle Fire tablets today : the HDX 8.9 refresh and the Fire HD Kids Edition . The new and larger HDX has improved specs , while the Kids Edition has special content for kids , a special case , and a free two-year `` no questions asked '' warranty .

Amazon began its grocery delivery service AmazonFresh waaay back in 2007 , and it 's finally launching for the first time on the east coast . AmazonFresh deliveries in New York City start today , the company confirmed to Re/code . Unfortunately for most residents of the Big Apple the service for now is only available in Brooklyn , beginning in Park Slope and eventually expanding outward . New York customers at this time will also need to be Amazon Prime subscribers . They 'll get deliveries free through the end of 2014 , but next year will have to upgrade to a $ 299 `` Prime Fresh '' membership . Think about how long ago 2007 was . The iPhone was brand new , and people would have looked at you funny if you told them to `` snap chat '' you . AmazonFresh has so far operated in California and Seattle , so it 's nice to finally see it head east after all this time . Orders placed before 10am will be delivered the same day , and orders made after that will arrive the following day . In addition Fresh is not limited to just groceries , and customers can have electronics and other items delivered too . Whether Amazon can compete with the wealth of other grocery delivery services that have emerged in New York in its absence will be fun to watch .

Google just staked its – third , fourth ? – claim for the living room with the Nexus Player . The search giant announced seemingly out of the blue on October 15 that its Android TV-based set-top box will be available for pre-order starting October 17 . Despite previous leaks of what was then known as Android TV ( that 's just the name of the platform ) , the now-confirmed Asus-built box is actually more like a round puck . The all-black , matte plastic device is a 120 x 120 x 20 mm ( W x D x H ) cylinder powered by a 1.8GHz , quad-core Intel Atom chip supported by and Imagination PowerVR Series 6 GPU . That said , of course the Nexus Player is designed for both media streaming and gaming . Hooked up to the Google Play Store , you can download all manner of movies , streaming apps and games to the Nexus Player 's tiny 8GB of storage . Plus , the Nexus Player is 100 % Google Cast ready : beam content from almost any device right to the console , just like the Chromecast . Other specs include HDMI-out ( up to 1080p at 60Hz refresh rate ) , one microUSB 2.0 port , 802.11ac Wi-Fi ( with 2x2 MIMO ) and Bluetooth 4.0 . The latter is how the included Bluetooth Smart remote – with voice control , mind you – connects to the device . Sadly , Google likely just rung the death knells for the crowd-funded Android gaming box with one simple announcement . Google will sell the already-leaked Nexus Player game controller , also made by Asus , separately for a currently undisclosed price . This move also puts extra pressure on the likes of Amazon ; it 's Amazon Fire TV is capable of playing any Android game released through its proprietary app store , which is decidedly smaller than Google Play . Apple , with only its AirPlay technology via its Apple TV puck , seems to also be square in Google and Asus 's sights with this feature . Google has n't said a peep about how much the Nexus Player – and the sold-separately controller – will cost . This is particularly interesting , given that pre-orders start October 17 , and the device hits major retailers come November 3 . Stay tuned , as they .
Google Chairman Eric Schmidt identified Amazon as the biggest competitor to the search giant in a speech in Berlin , rather than Microsoft or Apple Schmidt brought up research from the Forrester group , which suggested that a third of people looking to buy something started on Amazon - more than twice the number going to Google itself . Much of Schmidt 's speech was designed to downplay talk of Google having the monopoly in tech , with the former CEO insisting that the company is merely one amongst several leviathans . Google , he said , accounts for only 10 % of traffic sent to German-based Bild , the most widely read newspaper in Europe , and companies such as Zolando , Qwant and Amazon are more likely destinations for those planning a purchase.. He went on to mention other companies that dominate their respective markets , while bemoaning the criticism of Google 's dominance in search . The company has around 9,000 employees in the EU and has made capital investments amounting to over $ 5 billion ( about £3.15 billion , AU $ 5.8 billion ) in the region .

Amazon has contributed massively the decline of physical retail stores , so it 's pretty dang ironic that the online retailer is allegedly working to join them in the streets . The bookseller is opening its first full-fledged physical location in New York City , in the heart of Manhattan , nestled right next to the Empire State Building , sources told the Wall Street Journal . Apparently the store will launch as an experiment , but it 's easy to see how it could lead to more physical Amazon locations . But what could a brick and mortar Amazon location offer that customers ca n't get more easily by simply visiting Amazon.com ? For one thing the site will reportedly accept returns , like the temporary pop-up locations that Amazon has opened in the past . Customers will also be able to pick up their online orders there so they do n't have to wait as long for them to ship . The retailer may also be considering showing off its Kindle , Kindle Fire , and other devices there , though that 's reportedly still up in the air . If this is an experiment then it could conceivably lead to more physical Amazon stores - depending how customers feel about leaving the house to do something they could more easily do from their couches .

Amazon announced its intentions to buy gameplay broadcasting service Twitch for $ 970 million ( about £605m , AU $ 1.1b ) in August , and now the deal has become official . The transaction 's closure was revealed in a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing from late September . Amazon 's bid for Twitch was preceded by months of rumors that Google would be the one to buy Twitch , and it may never be clear exactly what happened among these three companies . But now that Amazon officially owns Twitch , we can wonder : is this a good thing or a bad thing for gamers ? On the one hand Twitch will undoubtedly benefit from Amazon 's vast resources and wealth . Then again , Twitch was already doing very well for itself , having grown in just a few years into one of the biggest services on the internet . Twitch said the sale will `` enable [ it ] to accelerate all of the things we want to do for our community , '' and the company will retain some independence . But there 's a valid argument to be made that this will turn out bad for gamers in the end . Via Re/code

Amazon is preparing a free ad-supported video streaming service to accompany Prime Instant Video according to the New York Post . Although Amazon is yet to make anything approaching an official announcement , the New York Post claims the company is set to launch a free video streaming service , supported by adverts . This would accompany Amazon 's current offering Prime Instant Video , which comes as a package with a £79/ $ 99 annual Prime membership , also getting you free delivery on Amazon 's store . While far from a certainty , it would be a clear way to combat the popularity of Netflix , which uses 35 % of the US ' total bandwidth at peak times . Amazon Prime Instant Video , well , let 's just say it does n't use up anything like that . The relative unpopularity of Prime Instant Video continues despite Amazon 's use of Netflix-like tactics , including producing exclusive shows such as Alpha House , Transparent and Betas . Amazon has retorted to these rumours saying it has `` not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service , '' but naturally this does not rule out such a move in the future . Adding a free service would make Amazon 's video offering one of the most diverse around , with free , paid-for and on-subscription content , potentially all being doled-out from the same platform . Amazon has n't announced the breadth of its Prime subscriber base , but as Instant Video is just a bonus feature , it is likely that a relatively small proportion actually watch the service regularly compared with Netflix subscribers . via AJC

Amazon was said back in March to be working on a free streaming service , though the bookseller staunchly denied it at the time . Now those rumors have been reignited thanks to a new report from the New York Post . The site says Amazon will launch a free , ad-supported video streaming service early in 2015 . The service will reportedly be completely separate from Amazon Prime . The Post spoke with `` ad sources '' who are allegedly in talks with Amazon about the service , one of whom said it will be designed to ultimately `` lure '' users into paying for Prime subscriptions . And unlike when Amazon was reportedly considering this move in March , it 's now `` a definite go , '' the site says . For now Amazon is remaining mum on this one , so it sounds like we 'll probably have to wait until next year to find out for sure .

Amazon 's already taken a swing at the TV market with Fire TV , but it 's now delivering a follow-up punch with the Fire TV Stick , a smaller plug-and-play dongle to take on rivals like Chromecast and Roku . That dongle is now shipping to buyers in the US for the price of $ 39 ( around £25/AU $ 45 ) - or , if you bought it as a Prime subscriber , you 'll get it for a knocked-down $ 19 ( around £12/AU $ 22 ) . You can go order one right now but you 'd better be quick , as Amazon warns us that it 's selling them on a first-come , first-served basis . The Fire TV Stick can be used for viewing media or , if you fancy it , `` flinging '' apps to the big screen . Amazon also says this is its `` most successful device launch ever '' but is n't disclosing numbers . What we 're more interested in , however , is news of global availability . Amazon told TechRadar that it still has no comment on when the rest of the world might see it . But going on previous Amazon device rollouts , we expect everyone else will be waiting until the new year .

Apple Pay and Google Wallet may have smartphone NFC payments locked down for now , but there 's more to mobile commerce than waving your phone around at CVS . Now PayPal and Amazon have extended their reach on smartwatches , letting you wave your whole arm around instead of just your phone . The bookseller has updated its own Amazon app for Android Lollipop , adding support for Android Wear in the process . It lets users with Google-powered wearables search for , buy and add products to their wish lists with voice commands . Meanwhile PayPal , which already has an Android Wear app , has released a brand new app for Pebble watches that lets users make payments anywhere PayPal is accepted and search for nearby businesses that take PayPal . Thank goodness they 're finally coming up with ways to buy things on the go without having to resort to the arduous task of pulling your big , clunky smartphone out of your pocket . Via Ubergizmo
Amazon revealed that Intel has built a custom , Haswell-based processor called the Xeon E5-2666 v3 , one that will deliver compute-optimised EC2 instances called C4 . The processor runs at a base clock speed of 2.9GHz and can reach clock speeds of up to 3.5GHz . The processor will power instances with a two vCPU count all the way up to 36 with up to 60GB RAM on the latter and 10Gbps network connectivity . Not much is known about that processor ; the 2663 model is a 10-core , 10 thread model with a base clock speed of 2.8GHz . a turbo frequency of 3.5GHz and 25MB L3 cache while the 2667 one has a lower core count ( eight ) but more threads ( 16 ) with a higher base frequency ( 3.2GHz ) and a turbo frequency of 3.6GHz . Amazon is not the first big custom CPU client Intel has enlisted ; earlier in July , the company confirmed that it build a Xeon E7-8890 v2 CPU for database giant , Oracle . What 's interesting with both of those chips is that they contain an onboard FPGA that provides it with a degree of flexibility , allowing the hardware to be tweaked on-the-fly without the need for a reboot . Intel has secured more than 30 custom product wins in 2014 , more than double what it achieved in 2013 .

`` Amazon Prime members will have access to a great selection of Ultra HD content on Prime Instant Video at no additional cost . '' So said Michael Paull , VP of Amazon Digital Video , in a statement given today that confirms the retailer is making UHD content a no-cost addition to its Prime package . That covers both films and TV series ' as well as Amazon original content like Transparent and Alpha House . The decision not to charge more for 4K content could win Amazon some kudos after Netflix announced it wants you to pay more for bumped up resolution . `` 4K is still a new technology . It needs to get inside people 's houses , build up user numbers and prove its worth before it becomes a thing that 's worth extra money , '' opined Gary Cutlack on TechRadar last weekend . This is Amazon 's second announcement this week regarding the extra benefits of a Prime subscription . The company also revealed its plans to offer free , unlimited photo storage to UK customers via Prime Photos . Meanwhile , is the Amazon Echo just another colossal copycat ?

Amazon unleashed an unexpected new device on the tech world with the Echo , a gadget that gives away little at first glance . What is it ? Where did it come from ? Do I need one ? These are all perfectly reasonable questions to be asking yourself right now . And luckily we have answers for you . The Amazon Echo is less than 10 inches tall , but that does n't make it portable . It 's meant to have a home in your living room , and despite its small stature , it may just take over whatever space you put it in . Here are five things you should know if you 're at all intrigued by the Amazon Echo . Perhaps first and foremost , the Amazon Echo is a Bluetooth speaker . That means you can connect any Bluetooth-capable device - from an iPhone 6 to your laptop - to it wirelessly to play music or other audio . As such it has some interesting audio components on the inside of its small , cylindrical chassis . Amazon calls it `` advanced audio design . '' Most of its innards are comprised of audio components , like `` dual downward-firing '' speakers that shoot sound outward all 360 degrees around the device . The bookseller says it can fill an entire room . A `` reflex port '' allows for `` deeper sounds without distortion , '' while a 2.5-inch woofer and 2-inch `` tweeter '' round out the lows and the highs of whatever you 're listening to . The Echo comes with a remote with a built-in mic and music playback and volume controls , and as a wi-fi enabled gadget , it can access streaming music services like Amazon Music , Prime Music , iHeartRadio , and TuneIn . Which brings us to our next point… Given that the Amazon Echo can access streaming music services - but lacks a display with which to navigate said services - Amazon must be pretty confident in its voice recognition capabilities . Underneath the gadget 's light ring on top is a seven-microphone array with something Amazon calls `` far-field voice recognition , '' and these mics , as well as the one in the remote , are always on and always listening . They apparently `` use beam-forming technology '' to hear you no matter where you are in relation to the Echo ( is the name starting to make sense ? ) . In addition it has noise cancellation capabilities that allow it to hear your commands even when it 's piping out music . We 've established that the Amazon Echo has music-streaming abilities , and that it 's always on and listening . So what is it listening for ? The answer is a single word : `` Alexa . '' Saying `` Alexa '' where the Echo can hear you is like saying `` Xbox '' with an Xbox One Kinect in the room , or `` Hey Siri '' when your iPhone 6 feels like listening to you . In other words it gets the thing 's attention . And the main thing you 'll be doing once you have the Echo 's attention is searching - for music and more . You can tell it to play a certain artist or song , but you can also ask general questions : `` Will it rain tomorrow ? '' `` When is Thanksgiving ? '' and `` Wikipedia : Abraham Lincoln '' are just some of the queries Amazon has provided as examples . It remains to be seen how useful it will be to have the Echo read entire Wikipedia entries to aloud , but you ca n't deny it 's an interesting premise . In addition it seems you may be able to change the wake word - extra helpful for people who are actually named Alexa - though so far we have n't been able to confirm this with Amazon . We 'll update here if we do . Thankfully the Echo 's functionality is n't limited to its microphones , speaker and remote . There 's also an app for Android handsets and Amazon Fire phones , plus a browser app for other devices - and we 're guessing that will extend further if the Echo takes off . According to Amazon you can use the Echo 's companion app to manage whatever it 's doing , from the music it 's playing to alarms and beyond . The app will also help you with initial set-up , including connecting the Echo to wi-fi . If the Echo is as capable as Amazon says , it may well be easy to do almost everything without the app , but sometimes you just need to have a screen to accomplish what you want , and thankfully it seems Amazon knows that . But the most exciting thing about the Amazon Echo is that Amazon may be using it to kickstart its own connected Internet of Things at home . In addition to what we 've already discussed , the Echo can manage your to-do lists , alarms and reminders , and it can also play radio stations . But that 's far from the device 's limit , according to Amazon , and the bookseller has promised it will be updated periodically with new features and services . In between updates the Echo will always be learning and improving , the company says , and there are clearly lots of possibilities . Imagine the potential it has to be the access point for your whole connected home : `` Alexa , turn the heat up in the kitchen ; '' `` Alexa , is the front door locked ? '' `` Alexa , turn on the Xbox . '' And the best part ? That way you would n't have to rely on Kinect anymore .
Technology , like art , music and culture , is a discussion . A two-way street . Call and response . If something new pops up this year from Apple , expect Google to have a similar product to show you in six month ’ s time . It ’ s no wonder then , that after Siri , Cortana , Kinect and “ OK , Google , ” we ’ d get Alexa , a personal assistant from Amazon that can do … well , everything the others do but in a Bluetooth speaker . Alexa , I should point out , is a codename . Amazon hasn ’ t told us what the personal assistant will be called , but only that he/she/it will come inside a cylindrical Bluetooth speaker . The speaker itself is called the Echo - named for its ability to pick up commands from anywhere in the room with , or without , music playing . It ’ s smart , interesting technology that I ’ m personally looking forward to owning . But as cool , smart and interesting as it is , the one thing it ’ s not is original . OK. Before I get my torch and pitchfork , I ’ m going to play devil ’ s advocate . What if Amazon isn ’ t just cashing in on the personal assistant fad ? What if this is the next online bookstore or Kindle ? The company is no stranger to innovative ideas . ( If you keep reading you can ’ t miss them . ) Imagine a house where you could say anything , anywhere and you would get a response back . To shout from your shower “ play LCD Soundsystem ” or tell your television to show you the score of the football game . And , bare with me here , imagine that just working without Siri/Google/Cortana telling you that they don ’ t understand that command . Maybe that ’ s what Amazon has planned for us . Maybe behind the curtain its curious minds are hard at work to create a one-to-one duplicate of the eponymous house from Disney ’ s “ Smart House. ” And just maybe the Echo is the first step . There ’ s an eternal optimist in me that ’ s rooting for that . After reading up on Amazon ’ s history , however , that hope for innovation has dwindled . You see , the Echo isn ’ t Amazon ’ s first ‘ me too ’ idea . If you can remember back to the late ‘ 90s , Amazon wasn ’ t always a retail giant that purveyed everything from baby diapers to wolf urine . ( Yes , they still sell wolf urine on Amazon . ) They started off as a quaint online bookseller . And , as far as I can tell , this was a unique idea . Becoming an online , independent book seller was something no other company had successfully accomplished before , and yet here was Amazon and its founder , Jeff Bezos , standing in the proverbial limelight . Bezos even named the company Amazon because it was a place that was `` exotic and different . '' And , for a few years , some original ideas kept flowing from the all-consuming ecommerce giant . But in 1999 , the idea of becoming something more than a book broker set in . In the year before the 21st century , Amazon had an idea , one it borrowed from the market pioneer , eBay . ( Does it sound weird to anyone else calling eBay a “ pioneer ? ” ) It opened a marketplace where users could buy different forms of media like CDs and DVDs directly from them . zShops , as it was called back then , went on to become the Amazon store . Fast-forward to 2007 when Amazon unveiled its first ereader , the Amazon Kindle . The device , on paper , was understated and simple . It read a new breed of PDFs that it called e-books . This was a renaissance for Amazon . The ereader started a revolution that caught fire , further cementing Amazon as the only major generalist retailer of the 21st century . But , innovation - especially in the tech industry - is often short-lived . Four years later the company would go on to launch a tablet , the year after that a second tablet , and two years after that a phone and set-top box . While each of these products brought at least one new feature to the table , all of them were clear indicators that Amazon was just following the trail of money . Which brings us to the announcement of the Amazon Echo ... What camp does the Echo belong in ? The “ me too ” cash-in camp or the actual innovation hangar ? All we can do is root for the latter while expecting the very real , semi-historical former .

Voice commands do n't always work very well on the Xbox One , but maybe Amazon can succeed where Microsoft has floundered ? The bookseller has introduced something called the Amazon Echo , a Bluetooth-enabled speaker with an always-on microphone that listens for voice commands . The Echo can play music or the news , answer questions , create lists , set alarms , and more at your command , according to Amazon . And the trigger word that prompts it to start listening is `` Alexa . '' It may not be ideal for people named Alexa , but Amazon says the Echo can hear you even when it 's playing music from its speaker . A 9-inch cylinder , the Amazon Echo has a built-in subwoofer and reflex port , a light around the top , an `` action '' button , and a button to mute the microphone . A companion app for Android and Fire phones , plus a browser app for other devices , helps with initial set-up and further management of the Echo . And Amazon says the Echo will harness the cloud to constantly learn and get smarter . The Amazon Echo is available to purchase by invite only for $ 199 ( about £125 , AU $ 230 ) or $ 99 ( about £60 , AU $ 115 ) for Amazon Prime subscribers .
The first Fire Phone has proved something of a failure , but Amazon says it is not ready to give up on creating more phones in the range . Amazon president of devices for Amazon in Europe Jorrit Van der Meulen says that does n't mean we wo n't see more Fire phones in the future , though . `` In an honest assessment of the Fire Phone , we 've learned a lot on this one… We 're undeterred , but we 're not immune to the criticism either . '' Rather than plugging away at the same blueprint , Van der Meulen suggests the second Fire phone may be quite different from the first , `` we certainly read everything that 's written from customers to journalists and take note , so might the second step be slightly different than our first step , sure . I suspect that it will be . '' This also suggests we may be a way off the second Fire Phone — although even in the fast-moving mobile world we 've barely waved goodbye to the first phone 's UK launch on 30 September . The Fire Phone 's dismal launch bit a $ 170 million chunk out of Amazon 's recent financial reports , with $ 83 million worth of the things sitting around unsold . Van der Meulen compared this failure with that of the first Kindle device , which was a rather funny-looking thing compared with what we 're used to today . And no everyone loves Kindles now , right ? However , there are obvious differences in terms of the markets these devices are part of . Smartphones are fairly mature – ebook readers were n't back in 2007 . We 'll have to wait to see whether Amazon has already done too much damage with the first Fire Phone to rise again , possibly next year . Via Guardian

Buying an Amazon Fire device , like the Amazon Fire Phone or Kindle Fire HD , nets you unlimited Amazon cloud drive photo storage . But as of today you wo n't have to buy a Fire device anymore to get that benefit - just subscribe to Amazon Prime . The offer extends to photos uploaded from any type of device , not just Amazon gadgets , and any type of photos - including large RAW format snaps . And with automatic photo uploads from all your handsets this is a pretty good perk for Prime subscribers . Microsoft just made a similar move , giving Office 365 subscribers unlimited free OneDrive storage . That 's probably no coincidence . However Amazon 's offer is more limited , as Microsoft 's applies to more than just photos . But Amazon 's cloud drive services have plenty of other benefits , including backup services , connectivity between all your devices and more . Via Neowin

Amazon is a company that is hard to define . Originally built as a book seller , the company has since grown into an immense online warehouse , filled with anything you could ask for . It now manufactures phones , a tablet , has given birth to a range of e-readers , and much more . And all while making virtually no profit , essentially being bankrolled by investor money in place of profits . In 2014 alone , the company made a loss of over $ 400 million and continues to do so , as all available revenues are ploughed back into generating double-digit growth . Almost every major technology company in America has a single goal , or at least a single product line that generates the bulk of revenue and is therefore focused on by the company . For Apple it was the iPod – and is now the iPhone . For Google it 's search , for Facebook it 's advertising based on 'likes ' , for Microsoft it 's Windows , and for Twitter it 's promoted tweets or trends . Contrastingly , Amazon has no such single ambition . The company has its fingers in many pies across a seemingly infinite array of markets – but has it spread itself too thin ? Earlier this year , Amazon attempted to enter the smartphone space with the Fire Phone , a high-end handset to rival Apple 's iPhone and Samsung 's Galaxy range . In Q3 2014 , Amazon announced that it was taking a $ 170 million write down on unsold stock of the Fire Phone . Before this , many outlets in the US dropped the on-contract price of the Fire Phone to 99 cents in an effort to shift the phone ; a plan that obviously has n't worked as well as anticipated . Of course , Amazon has previously had success with hardware in the form of Kindles , which lead the e-reading space , and the Fire range of tablets – so why should phones be different ? The answer is that Amazon strayed from what it knows , and it 's paid for it . Kindles and tablets are content consumption devices and Amazon sells content – books , films , music , and so on – so understands the market and the needs of those who buy the devices . Phones are content consumption devices , but also communications devices and this is an area of which Amazon has very little knowledge . TechRadar gave the Fire Phone two and a half stars , summarising , `` The Fire Phone is a shopping tool for Amazon with some phone features baked in . '' And this is exactly Amazon 's problem : the phone was only `` baked in , '' not an integral part of the experience . Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed a minimalist sentiment to Charlie Rose in an interview this summer saying that Apple `` can lay all the products [ it ] sells on a table '' and yet Apple is inline to make $ 180 billion in revenue during 2014 , a number other companies ( especially those outside of the oil business ) can only dream of . Granted , the operational structure and product portfolio of Apple is entirely different to that of Amazon , and so the comparison is n't entirely fair . But there 's much to be said for a simplistic set of ideals and projects . Many of the things that Amazon invests in – drones , for instance – have very little future revenue-making potential on a large scale , and investors are starting to get worried . After Amazon announced its Q3 results , shares dropped 10 % as investors balked at another quarter without profits ; another quarter where their money subsidised a business running at-cost . There are companies with a large portfolio of products that still generate vast incomes , such as Microsoft and ( to some extent ) Amazon . Where they differ , however , is profit . Microsoft has a headcount of over 100,000 and still manages to make billions in profit per quarter due to a profitable core business of selling licences for Windows to PC vendors and consumers .

Update : Amazon has announced that its 4K service is now live for Prime Instant Video users in the UK too . As long as you 're a Prime customer , you 'll be able to enjoy UHD content at no extra charge . However the app is only compatible with Sony Ultra HD smart TVs right now , with models from Samsung and LG to be added in 2015 . Original story below ... Following in the footsteps of Netflix - and getting in the door just in time for festive viewing - Amazon has launched 4K streaming for Instant Video . The service has gone live in the US , while a spokesperson told TechRadar : `` Today 's news is US-only . We do n't comment on future plans , please stay tuned . '' Amazon 's Ultra HD streams are available through Instant Video app or on any compatible smart TVs . As you 'd expect , the selection is limited for now , with BBC 's Orphan Black joining Amazon 's originals and a handful of titles from Sony . But the best news is that customers wo n't be asked to pay anything on top of their current Prime fee should they want to enjoy some 4K .
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in early December that `` it 's going to take many iterations '' to get the Amazon Fire Phone right . Well , iteration number two is reportedly in the works - though it wo n't arrive any time soon . The Amazon Fire Phone 2 wo n't be released until 2016 , sources told Venturebeat . The phone has been in development for months , but Amazon was reportedly forced to go `` back to the drawing board '' thanks to the first Fire Phone 's failure , according to a source . There 's no indication yet of exactly what that might mean , but given how the Amazon Fire Phone performed , it 's probably for the best .

Amazon has just announced the arrival of its Prime Now service , which will get orders to your doorstep in a matter of minutes , not days . The service offers package delivery times of under an hour to Prime customers although it 's quite limited right now . In fact , it 's running exclusively in Manhattan , New York , and you 'll need to download an app to use it . But Amazon has promised that it will be coming to `` a city near you '' in the future . No doubt it 's using Manhattan as a testbed before it expands further , so fingers crossed there are no hiccups . Amazon promises that it 'll deliver seven days a week , with one-hour deliveries costing $ 7.99 and two-hour deliveries costing nothing at all ( apart from an existing Prime membership ) .

Google is reportedly looking to amp up its Google Shopping efforts with the addition of a `` buy now '' button . That 's according to the Wall Street Journal , which says Google wants to `` more directly challenge Amazon '' with Google Shopping . Sources told the site that Google has been chatting up retailers about including the `` buy '' button in its Google Shopping search results rather than redirecting users to retailers ' own websites . Google letting shoppers buy directly where they 're already searching may indeed be a good idea - though it 's unclear how Google might be trying to sell that to retailers . One incentive might be a marketing program that would let Google 's partner merchants advertise two-day shipping for goods bought through Google Shopping , but so far retailers are reportedly not hot on this idea overall .
HBO today continued its slow-moving efforts to put HBO Go on every platform available with its release on Amazon Fire TV . The Amazon set-top box joins the Xbox One , Google Chromecast and a whole bunch of other devices where users can access HBO 's enormous catalog of TV shows and movies . In its announcement today , Amazon says the number of apps on Fire TV has quadrupled since the device 's launch , but that HBO Go was their `` most requested '' addition . ' The bookseller added that HBO Go will arrive on the Amazon Fire TV Stick in the Spring . And `` to celebrate , '' Amazon explained , Fire TV is on sale for $ 79 - $ 20 below the normal price - until December 28 .

Update : We asked Amazon for its take on what caused its app to be removed from Google Play . An Amazon spokesperson relied that `` we launched a new Amazon App for Android Phones on September 9 that provides an award-winning mobile shopping experience , enables customers to discover and purchase all of Amazon 's digital catalogue , and provides customers access to the Prime Instant Video player and unlimited streaming of over 15,000 movies and TV episodes . `` Google subsequently changed their Developer Distribution Agreement on September 25 . As a result , we removed the app from Google Play and published the Amazon Shopping app . `` Customers who want the best Amazon experience on their Android phone , including access to Prime Instant Video and Amazon 's entire digital catalogue , can still get the Amazon App for Android Phones at amazon.co.uk/androidapp '' . Original story follows ... Amazon has replaced its Google Play app with a new version at Google 's behest - all because the old app linked users to Amazon 's own app store . Google does n't allow other app stores in Google Play , but Amazon updated its app in September with a link to download Amazon apps directly to users ' Android devices . It seemed the bookseller had gotten away with it , but now the app has disappeared , and Amazon confirmed with Android Police that Google forced it to take it down . Apparently the search company changed some language in its developer agreement in late September , making Amazon 's app objectively against the rules . The section previously stated that developers could not release apps `` whose primary purpose '' is to distribute other apps , while the new version prohibits `` any product which has a purpose '' that does the same . Oh well . Instead Google Play now hosts a new and separate `` Amazon Shopping '' app that , other than the removal of Amazon 's app listings , is identical to the old one . And the old one is still available for sideloading from Amazon 's website .

Since Jeff Bezos has built Amazon up from an online book retailer in the late 90s to the behemoth it is today , he probably knows a few things about taking calculated gambles . `` If you 're going to take bold bets , they are going to be experiements and if they 're experiments you do n't know ahead of time if they 're going to work , '' the Amazon CEO told Business Insider in a recent interview . Bezos went on to explain that he would never have an all-or-nothing play to make a particular product or service the saviour of the business : `` I do n't believe in 'bet the company ' bets . That 's when you 're desperate . That 's the last thing you can do , '' he states at the end of the interview . Steve Ballmer famously referred to Windows 8 as a 'bet the company ' moment for Microsoft when it was released in 2012 . The revamped OS was Microsoft 's gamble to stake a claim in the mobile market dominated by Apple and Google . One look at the customer feedback for Windows 8 shows that many were n't convinced by Ballmer 's bet . Is Bezos having a dig at the original tech giant ? It seems that way if you read between the lines . But Amazon has n't had 2014 all its own way , especially given the spectacular flop of the Amazon Fire Phone . The Amazon boss explains in the interview that his job was to run the company in such a way that the successes could pay for the failures . He argued products like the Kindle ereaders and Amazon Prime subscription service have covered bombs such as the ill-advised pets.com . Although Bezos does n't specifically mention the Amazon Fire Phone , the writing 's on the wall . The handset was the company 's first smartphone venture and , although it did n't go down well , Bezos has n't faltered . He 's previously stated that there will be more Amazon Fire phones on the way .
There 's an old saying : `` if you 're in a hole , stop digging '' . Amazon 's Jeff Bezos clearly has n't heard it , because he plans to follow the Fire phone fiasco by making more Fire phones . This week we also heard about the decidedly different Yotaphone , caught rumblings of an HTC One M9 , noted Acer getting hardcore , met a time-travelling PS4 and caught news of what we really hope is the death of those dreaded Captcha boxes on websites . It 's the week in tech ! What 's white and invisible ? That ball ! But it 's no joke for Hugh Langley , who 's been playing catch with an invisible ball . No , he has n't eaten too much blue cheese . He 's been testing the Glove1 , a wearable designed to provide haptic feedback in games and which looks like some kind of cybernetic Michael Jackson accessory . `` Combine this with an Oculus Rift and we may have already solved virtual reality 's input problem , '' Langley says . Remember the Amazon Fire Phone , Amazon 's smartphone with a whizzy 3D display and absolutely terrible reviews ? Amazon boss Jeff Bezos admits that it 's been a disaster , but that eventually it 'll be good . It 's nice to see Bezos agreeing with our very own Max Slater-Robins , who wrote that `` Amazon strayed from what it knows… phones [ are ] communications devices , and this is an area of which Amazon has very little knowledge . '' Google Glass was the head-mounted computer that we were told would change the world and stuff . Well it did n't change the world and we all forgot about it for a bit , but now it 's back ! Back ! BACK ! Or at least , it 's nearly back . 2015 will bring a new , improved , Intel-powered Glass , and it 's getting a new look too . It 's still dorkier than Dorky Dave of Dork Street , Dorktown , but it 's sleeker than before and should deliver better performance and battery life as you flee from muggers trying to steal it from your face . The successor to the excellent HTC One M8 is coming , with the innovative name One M9 - or maybe it 'll be called the Hima , because a device with that very name has just leaked all over the internet . `` If the specifications are true , '' Matt Hanson says , `` then HTC 's next flagship smartphone could be a doozy . '' How does an octa-core 64-bit Snapdragon , 20.7MP camera and Cat 6 LTE grab you ? In years to come people may look back on us and say `` imagine ! Their phones only had one front ! '' That 's what the newly launched Yotaphone 2 might mean , anyway : it has not one but two touchscreens , one on each side . One 's an AMOLED and the other is E-ink , and it goes on sale this week . You just know Samsung 's planning one with 3 screens now . It turns out that Acer has `` internal hordes of hardcore gamers '' and the firm is picking their brains to help it design the next generation of hardcore gaming products . Speaking to TechRadar , CEO Jason Chen said that the firm was talking to gamers within and without the firm to better understand gamers ' requirements ranging from turbo modes to case illumination . Can you believe the PlayStation is 20 ? It is , and to celebrate Sony has made a version of the PS4 in the same colours as the original . We 're gutted - we 've just bought a black one . The retro model will be a limited edition , and it should be out in time for Christmas . Bad news for robots and good news for people : Google has found a better way to combat bots than the hated Captcha boxes that infest the internet . All you need to do is click on a checkbox that says `` I 'm not a robot '' . You 're probably wondering how that 'll stop real robots , and the answer is that the box is upstairs and robots ca n't climb stairs and… actually that 's Daleks . The truth is that Google uses `` a whole bag of cues '' including how you use the cursor , what your IP address is , and what your innermost thoughts are . Er , probably .

It looks like some people just do n't take no for an answer , with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos hinting that we may be getting new versions of the Amazon Fire Phone . The question is why ? The first Amazon Fire Phone was widely considered a flop , with Bezos himself acknowledging that it fell flat . Our review was also less than glowing , pointing out the high price and unintuitive user experience as two major faults of the device . While we would n't blame Amazon for cutting its losses with the Amazon Fire Phone ( which are currently $ 170 million ) and moving on , it looks like the online retailer is going to press on with its smartphone offering . Talking at Business Insider 's conference in New York , Bezos said that he would n't judge the success of the Fire Phone just yet , and instead `` it 's going to take several iterations '' before we get an idea of how the Fire Phone performed . This is the strongest hint yet that Amazon is pressing ahead with new versions of the smartphone . The first Fire Phone might not have been a hit , but sometimes you have to make some mistakes before you get something right . Bezos pointed out that his previous websites were less than successful , as proof that one failure should n't put an end to your ambitions . `` `` I have made billions of dollars of failures at Amazon.com … literally ... You might remember Pets.com or Kozmo . '' Pets.com and Kozmo might not have set the online world on fire , but if Bezos had quit there we would n't have had Amazon.com . Some might claim that would n't be a bad thing , but you ca n't deny that the internet would be a very different place without it . Via Recode
The Amazon Fire Phone has not exactly been the hit that Amazon was no doubt hoping for , but at least CEO Jeff Bezos is n't shying away from that fact . He categorized the Fire Phone as a `` smart failure '' today during Business Insider 's Ignition conference , reports NBC . `` People love to focus on things that are n't working . That 's fine , but it 's incredibly hard to get people to take bold bets . And if you push people to take bold bets , there will be experiments … that do n't work , '' he said . Amazon 's Web Services , Kindle tablets and Prime subscription service are bold bets that paid off , he said , whereas the Fire Phone - though apparently cut from the same ingenious cloth - simply did n't . One might argue that the Fire Phone would n't have failed at all if it was such a `` smart '' idea , but Bezos apparently disagrees . When asked about future Amazon smartphones , though , the CEO said to ask again `` in some number of years . '' `` It 's going to take many iterations , '' he admitted .

If you 're unhappy about how Google 's Gmail or Microsoft 's Outlook is handling your email and displaying your electronic calendar , Amazon is offering another option for corporate users called WorkMail . Citing alleged customer complaints that existing solutions are often expensive and complex , Amazon is focusing on simplicity and security as WorkMail 's selling points . Rather than forcing users to use a new web app or replacing a familiar desktop program like Microsoft 's Outlook , WorkMail is a service that you can use with your favorite email app . WorkMail will deliver your emails to your company 's preferred email app . WorkMail emails are encrypted and sent through Amazon 's servers . With email encryption , Amazon will give companies using its email services the decryption keys for their corporate emails . Emails will only be stored on servers in specific geographic areas for added security . WorkMail is priced at $ 4 ( £2.64 or AUD $ 5.05 ) per email account per month . While the pricing is competitive with Google Apps for Work and Microsoft Office 365 , Amazon 's rivals offer more , including online tools for word processing , creating spreadsheets , and collaborating on presentations . Email is only part of the equation for many businesses , and WorkMail may not offer a complete solutions for intra-office communications . Through Hangouts and Skype , both Google and Microsoft offer similar solutions for chatting , calling , and video conferencing to extend communications . Business-centric messaging apps like HipChat , Slack , and Yammer bring real-time messaging and collaboration , things that may be more difficult to achieve with email . At this time , Google has not announced tools for collaboration and messaging beyond email through its WorkMail service .

You 'd be hard pressed to find a pie that Amazon does n't have a finger in , but it looks like the retailer has had enough of the mobile payments scene for now : its Amazon Wallet beta program is getting canned this week after six months . The limited scheme was only available in the US during its short lifespan and the fact that it 's now being shuttered would suggest that Amazon does n't think it has the potential to be a long-term project further afield . There 's also Apple Pay of course , now up and running in the US and apparently coming to the UK in the near future . It 's possible that Amazon knows a losing battle when it sees one . Amazon Wallet was first announced around the same time as the Fire Phone - and look how well that turned out . CEO Jeff Bezos obviously had dreams of it becoming the default payments system on Amazon hardware , but those ambitions are now on hold . Users of Amazon Wallet were informed via email that it would cease to exist . It will disappear from Amazon 's app store but any current gift , loyalty or membership card balance can still be spent . Amazon never got around to adding debit or credit card support , which is quite a hole to leave . `` We have learned a great deal from the introduction of the Wallet and will look for ways to apply these lessons in the future as we continue to innovate on behalf of our customers , '' said Amazon spokesman Tom Cook in a statement .

Not that happy with just creating original content for Prime subscribers , Amazon is now branching out to the big screen . The company announced it will begin producing and acquiring original movies for theatrical release , with a view to get 12 films on screens per year . It 'll also secure early window distribution for Amazon Prime Instant Video , shrinking the gap between theatrical and VoD release to between just four and eight weeks . `` We look forward to expanding our production efforts into feature films . Our goal is to create close to twelve movies a year with production starting later this year , '' said Amazon Studios VP Roy Price . `` Not only will be bring Prime Instant Video customers exciting , unique , and exclusive films soon after a movie 's theatrical run , but we hope this program will also benefit filmmakers , who too often struggle to mount fresh and daring stories that deserve an audience . '' Netflix is currently at work on its first movie , a sequel to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon , but the big red company 's ambition ends with an online release - Amazon is the only one with the big screen in its sights . Amazon partly determines which of its pilots will be made into full TV shows based on user feedback , and we see no reason why it could n't employ a similar technique for film . Either way , this is an interesting play from Bezos and co .

Although news that Amazon is now producing and distributing original TV shows and movies is hogging all the headlines , cloud computing news from the Amazon Web Services re : Invent conference in Las Vegas is certainly as momentous , especially if your interest lies in enterprise technology areas such as database , networking , virtualization , storage and development tools . AWS has been the clear market leader in public cloud computing since it began operations in 2006 . In the early days , AWS attracted a slew of startups and open source developers looking for a cheap and flexible development environment that could be readily scaled up depending on resource demand . Now it 's becoming the platform of choice for enterprise developers looking for a place to create and deploy state-of-the-art web-scale applications . In the last two months , AWS has begun shipping a number of new products and services targeted at the enterprise segment of the market . These include three new Application Lifecycle Management tools , CodeDeploy , CodeCommit and CodePipeline , that make it easier for developers to build , test , and deploy their applications on the AWS Cloud by automating AWS software release and deployment processes . The new AWS Service Catalog allows IT administrators to set up and configure a portfolio of services ( such as SharePoint or Office 365 ) , which end users can access and deploy via a portal without IT help . The Service Catalog allows IT to maintain control - by individual , group , department , or cost center - over who is allowed to use which products in the catalog as well as limiting how many times an application can be used each month in order to comply with licensing or for other reasons . One of the major concerns regarding cloud computing has always been security . AWS 's new Key Management Service ( KMS ) is a managed service that makes it easier for enterprises to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt their data . The KMS dashboard offers a single place to create , store , view , and disable keys , and provides an audit trail of any activity involving encryption keys . KMS can be used for managing encryption keys for Amazon resources such as Elastic Block Store , Redshift , or Relational Database Service , as well as an enterprise 's on-premises resources . Perhaps the biggest recent AWS news is the announcement of Amazon Aurora , a new enterprise-scale RDBMS . AWS has numerous database related services ( both SQL and noSQL-based ) , including ones that can be used for petabyte scale data warehouses for big data and analytics . AWS 's Relational Database Service ( RDS ) is a suite of relational database types , instances and services that includes SimpleDB , MySQL , Postgres , Oracle , SQL Server and the new Amazon Aurora offering . According to Andy Jassy , Senior AWS Vice President , Aurora is `` a fully MySQL-compatible , relational database with 5X the performance of MySQL and 1/10th the cost . It 's also as durable , available , and fault tolerant as a proprietary database system . '' AWS has been working on Aurora for three years and Jassy says it will be available in early 2015 . Not all the newly announced products and services are available in all the 11 regions , 28 availability zones and 52 edge locations that currently make up the AWS infrastructure , which has data center locations in the US , Australia , Brazil , China , Germany , Ireland , Japan , and Singapore . Gartner Research last year estimated Amazon had five times the cloud capacity of its nearest 14 competitors combined . And its growth rate is n't slowing . As AWS chief Jassy pointed out at the re : Invent conference , AWS has more than a million active customers using AWS at this point , with a revenue growth rate of more than 40 % year over year . Although retail remains Amazon 's primary revenue source , Jassy said he expects `` in the fullness of time '' that AWS revenues will exceed those of retail . Despite strong efforts by cloud infrastructure competitors like Google Compute Engine and Microsoft Azure , Amazon has retained its strong lead in cloud IaaS . One of the many factoids that came out of the recent AWS conference is that each day AWS adds the equivalent server capacity to power Amazon when it was a global , $ 7B ( £4.67B or AU $ 8.86B ) enterprise ( circa 2004 ) . While still a long way from offering AWS 's product breadth and scale , Microsoft Azure has made strides to improve its cloud infrastructure and build on its position as the top alternative to AWS . As part of that effort , Microsoft recently announced three new Azure features , including support for massive virtual machines , Docker container support and a cloud-based encryption key system similar to AWS 's KMS . Leapfrogging cloud vendors Amazon , Google and Microsoft continue to leapfrog each other with new IaaS features . Last week , just days after Microsoft introduced its G series that it claimed was bigger than any virtual machine size currently available in the public cloud , AWS introduced its new C4 Series instances designed for the largest data-processing and e-commerce workloads sent to the cloud , which was even larger . Over the past few years , cloud computing has seen explosive growth with no signs of slowing down . According to a report from Gartner , cloud computing is expected to comprise the bulk of IT spending by 2016 with the majority of large enterprises adopting hybrid cloud systems by 2017 . Because it continues to grow and innovate , it 's likely AWS will maintain its lead in the public cloud space where it 's generally accepted as the number one vendor . But the maturing and diversification of the cloud market , the rise of hybrid cloud infrastructure and increased competition from Microsoft and Google , should keep AWS from resting on its laurels anytime soon .

With one day remaining before April Fool 's , Amazon has unveiled a new gimmick that we 're 100 % sure is n't a prank : Amazon Dash Button . The buttons let you order individual products , from Bounty paper towels to Gatorade , with a press . The idea is you stick them up in your pantry , laundry room or bathroom and give them a tap when you notice you 're running low . Amazon then charges your account and sends your order posthaste . Amazon Dash could potentially make it easier than ever to get certain home supplies - although the absurdity of dedicating an actual , physical dongle stuck on the wall of your home to simply buying rolls of toilet paper has us questioning this a bit . Amazon says the Dash Buttons are free for Amazon Prime users - with an invitation . To grab some for yourself head to amazon.com/oc/dash-button . This also could be a sort of proof-of-concept on Amazon 's part , as the company notes that `` developers , makers , and manufacturers can integrate the same service that powers Dash Button into their product or services , '' with a link to learn more . We asked the bookseller just to make sure this was n't a too-real-seeming joke , and a spokesperson confirmed it : this is a very real thing . Oh , joy .

Just imagine for a minute that The Sims was real life - no , bear with me . Now imagine that , like The Sims , you could solve just about any house problem through one easy-to-use portal . That 's how Amazon sees the future . The retail behemoth has just opened the doors to its Home Services store ( US-only right now ) , offering assistance for a vast range of things at just the click of a button . Those options range from the sublime to the actually quite useful . Snow removal , hedge trimming , patio assembly - these are all things that we can see a lot of people taking advantage of . But some of the services on offer are , quite frankly , a tad more niche . Things like goat grazing , for example . Yes , Amazon has a whole section of the site dedicated to Goat Herders ( beta , apparently ) where you can answer important questions like `` What 's the primary type of vegetation on your land ? '' ( Grassland , March , Shrubbery , Woodland , Other ) and `` Approximately how many acres of land do you need grazed ? '' before someone is sent out to resolve your goat-shaped dilemma . Or if your goat herding needs are already being satisfied , perhaps you 'd like to hire a silk aerialist instead . `` Goats and silk aerialists are where we need to be right now , '' is perhaps what some suit said at an Amazon meeting . We also like how the picture for 'Fly Treatment ' is just a picture of a swatter , suggesting Jeff Bezos might just come to your house and start angrily whacking at the walls . The actual service will be a lot more thorough than that , promises Amazon . Other favourites from the catalogue include pool table assembly , baker 's rack assembly , game console setup ( pretty straightforward , really ) , and , err , maths lessons . Though we joke about some of these , the Uber-fication of some services will surely cause concern for a lot of people . Amazon is going to be offer painters , decorators , plumbers , a removal service and even `` bed bug consultation '' at the click of a button . Welcome to the future . Would you like to start your 30-day trial ?

It 's been a funny old week . We 've seen One Direction go in two directions , witnessed a global outcry because a man was disciplined for punching a co-worker in the face and seen the worst viral video of all time featuring Nick Clegg . But while the world outside may be frightful , the world of tech is mainly delightful . This week we discover why Google Glass will make a comeback , how Facebook plans to claim your immortal soul and why this year 's laptops will make you more excited than a Top Gear presenter in a Porsche . Guaranteed to be 1,000 % more interesting than a star in a reasonably priced car , it 's week in tech ! `` Facebook wants to be everything to everybody '' , Gary Marshall says , and it `` wants to replace the internet . '' He might be right . This week Facebook unveiled the latest steps in its world domination plan with apps to replace email , SMS and newspapers and what Marshall describes as `` all of our messaging personal data and interpersonal interactions and shopping and health data and hopes and fears and dreams and darkest secrets . '' One of the biggest stories is the news that Facebook Messenger will become a platform that third parties can use , so you 'll see apps using Facebook to deliver their messages . There are already 40 apps for the platform , and they 'll show up inside the Facebook app so you never have to leave its warm embrace . That 's not all . There 's video embedding so you can put Facebook videos in non-Facebook places , a new phone app that enables you to make calls from inside Facebook , reports of newspaper and magazine deals so you can read their content from inside Facebook , an update to Messenger that enables you to pay people and buy things from inside Facebook , Facebook at Work so businesses can do business from inside Facebook and Oculus VR apps so that you can live your entire life inside Facebook . In short : Facebook Facebook Facebook Facebook Facebook . It seems that live video streaming is set to be the next big wave in `` social media '' , with Meerkat debuting to a lot of buzz earlier this month . Periscope , the latest app of this ilk to get people talking , launched this week with one key differentiator : it 's backed by Twitter . It also lets you archive clips for viewing later - something that Meerkat does n't . We had a go at making our own Periscope stream on the day of launch , before putting it head to head with Meerkat . We love PC gaming , and we 've devoted an entire week to it : from the best PC Zombie shooters of all time to the power of Minecraft and the tech that 's going to transform the way we play games , everything you need to know about gaming 's past , present and future is right here . Let 's be honest . For all its joys , Android is often spoiled by manufacturers and carriers who insist on putting their own apps on your pristine new smartphone . Hurrah for Samsung , then , because it 's decided that customers who buy the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge will be able to remove the pre-installed applications . That 's going to make a lot of Samsung fans very happy . Technology is a happy , sunny thing , except for when it is n't . Rene Millman has uncovered the tech sector 's dirty laundry and shared some of the dark secrets of the industry . Those secrets include crazy cost-cutting , discrimination and disappearing kit . While Facebook tries to take over the virtual world , Amazon 's continuing to annex more and more of the real one . Its latest wheezes include sticks and drones . The former is its Fire TV Stick , available for as little as £7 to new Prime subscribers and capable of turning even hotel TVs into Amazon Prime Instant Video viewers , and the latter is its ongoing investment in flying machines . While its drones are still grounded in the UK , the US has given Amazon the go-ahead to begin test flights for drone deliveries .

All the major cloud services offer an unlimited storage option - now , at last , including Amazon Cloud Drive . The bookseller announced today that Cloud Drive customers can pay a yearly fee for either unlimited everything storage ( $ 60 , about £40 , AU $ 75 ) or unlimited photos-only storage ( $ 12 , about £8 , AU $ 15 ) . Amazon Prime users and Fire device owners already have unlimited photo storage , and like that existing plan the new one offers subscribers 5GB for storing other types of files . And whichever you choose also include a three-month free trial for new users . Microsoft OneDrive , Google Drive and Dropbox offer similar deals , although theirs are markedly more expensive and mostly business-focused . Microsoft 's is even tied to an Office 365 subscription . But Amazon made it clear in today 's announcement that unlimited Amazon Cloud Drive storage is not just for enterprise users . `` Most people have a lifetime of birthdays , vacations , holidays , and everyday moments stored across numerous devices . And , they do n't know how many gigabytes of storage they need to back all of them up , '' Amazon Cloud Drive Director Josh Petersen said in the press release . Now they have a solution , Petersen purports . Both new Cloud Drive plans are available beginning today .

Next time you pack your bag for vacation , you might be bringing an extra electronic with you . Amazon has announced that the latest over-the-air update for the Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV Stick will endow the micro-systems with the ability to connect to Wi-Fi networks that require web authorization to connect . While that may sound like some crazy jargon Amazon stitched together to sound edgy , it might actually radically impact the way you travel . These web-authenticated networks Amazon is referring to are typically found in hotels and around college campuses that give the establishments greater control by assigning credentials to its users . The Fire TV is the first set-top box to have this ability , according to Amazon , though if it hits a chord with the college campus crowd , it may not be the last . The travel companion update was just one part of the larger patch rolling out to Fire TV . Other notable improvements are the ability for both devices to access Amazon Prime Music playlists , and the Fire TV to use USB devices for expandable memory and enabled pairing with Bluetooth headphones . What makes the travel portion so much juicier , however , is its implications for global nomads . Imagine taking the 9.9 oz Fire TV with you on a cross-country trek instead of a bulky laptop , or never missing an episode of Game of Thrones just because your hotel did n't have HBO . Are you a college student ready to cut the cord thanks to Amazon 's killer app ? Check out our Best online TV streaming services comparison .
Amazon has been working to get its drones off the ground for a long time , and the US 's Federal Aviation Administration has fought it every step of the way . Now , despite certain well-publicized victories , the US has fallen behind European countries when it comes to drones , and it 's in danger of slipping even further , Amazon Global Public Policy Vice President Paul Misener told a Senate subcommittee today . Apparently the company is designing and testing new drones more rapidly than the FAA can regulate to keep up with them . Where other countries have taken one or two months to approve entire categories of Amazon drones for testing , the FAA took over a year to OK a single drone model that 's now long obsolete , Misener said . `` We do n't test it anymore , '' he said . `` We 've moved on to more advanced designs that we already are testing abroad . '' The FAA has also proposed other regulations that would dictate that drones be controlled by humans and always in sight of their pilots , showing an understandable - but likely misguided - distrust of the technology . As The Verge notes , Senator Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) may introduce a bill that could speed the process up , and Amazon hinted that Congress might be able to persuade the FAA to move more quickly . For now , though , US residents are going to have to keep waiting for autonomous drones to drop packages on their doorsteps .

Though legal restrictions kept them grounded last year , Amazon has just been given clearance to start testing its delivery drones in the US . The FAA ( the same body that said Amazon 's drones were illegal in 2014 ) has officially given its blessing , but on condition that the micro-aircraft are flown at 400 feet or below , only during daylight hours , and are always in sight of the pilot . Those caveats show that Amazon has a lot of work to do before its Prime Air delivery service becomes the service it wants it to be . But this latest development is a big step forward . Furthermore , it 's expected that the FAA will soon announce revised rules for operating unmanned aircraft for commercial means , which could potentially give Amazon carte blanche to take its delivery service into the big time .

Amazon has gone stealth in its steps to build up an Internet of Things ( IoT ) strategy by quietly taking on board Denver-based startup 2lemetry . The acquisition , which has been confirmed by TechCrunch , gives Amazon an IP-enabled machine and connected device management and tracking solution geared towards enterprises . Financial terms have not been disclosed yet the firm , which was founded in 2011 , raised some $ 9 million ( around £6.1 million , or AU $ 11.7 million ) in venture funding including a $ 4 million ( around £2.7 million or AU $ 5.2 million ) funding round in January 2015 that comprised investment from a number of parties such as Salesforce Ventures . 2lemetry 's primary product is a flexible IoT platform that can interact with any system . ThinkFabric works by managing communication between IoT devices and the rest of the world , providing powerful data analysis , mission-critical insights , and guaranteed data delivery . It is highly scalable and there are no limits on the devices that can be connected meaning that even legacy devices can interact . It also has two solutions in the shape of Integrate , which extends the power of ThinkFabric by simplifying integration with enterprise apps or databases , and Incoming , which enables location and proximity sensing , facial recognition and geo-fencing for people , places and things . It 's unclear where 2lemetry will be incorporated into the Amazon 's growing IoT business with the likelihood that it will be integrated into the Amazon Web Services portfolio and taken on from there .

Late last year , Amazon launched Echo , its voice-controlled speaker with attitude . Although it looks like little more than a futuristic cylinder , Echo can answer questions or perform tasks by being spoken to . Now Amazon wants you to play games on it . Speaking at GDC 2015 , Amazon Developer Evangelist David Isbitski invited developers to start building games for Echo . Amazon has just launched a beta SDK for developers to start making custom apps , along with a sign-up page that you can find here . `` This thing would be great as a dungeon master , '' said Isbitski . `` It could say , 'go left or right ' , and you could say 'go right ' . You could tell this thing to tell me jokes . There 's so much potential here . ''

Amazon has moved to acquire yet another startup in the shape of ClusterK that includes technology that allows customers to saved thousands on Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) . First reported by Venture Beat , the deal is worth between $ 20 million and $ 50 million ( around £13 million to £32 million , or AU $ 25 million to AU $ 63 million ) and it 's expected that the money-saving technology will be built into Amazon 's EC2 Spot Instances product . At the heart of ClusterK 's offering is a piece of kit that allows customers to name their price for a share of servers running on AWS and run their applications for 10 % of the price they would otherwise pay . It even includes fault tolerance when prices rise . Amazon has been seeing plenty of interest in its Spot Instances since ClusterK began offering its capabilities to companies looking to save money and Marc Parrish , an investor in the startup , explained that it has been saving firms thousands . `` They did have quite a bit of traction before in saving POC [ proof of concept ] guys just a ton of money , like , $ 500,000 or $ 600,000 a year , '' Parrish said . The deal will see ClusterK 's team relocate to Amazon 's HQ in Seattle with founder and chief executive Dmitry Pushkarev taking on an important role at AWS and this should all result in Spot Instances becoming even easier to access for companies in the future .

Amazon has added a new feature to its Fire TV and Fire TV Stick which allow you to access X-Ray from your TV screen , instead of needing a tablet . X-Ray is the Amazon service that gives actor and trivia information about what 's happening on screen as you watch . Previously the service was only available with an Amazon tablet , but now the firm has allowed you to access the information at the press of a button , on your TV . This is a cool addition , and means that you can quickly ask the question `` where do I know this guy from ? '' without the need to pick up a tablet first . The service works because Amazon bought IMDB in 1998 , a service which now contains 180 million pieces of movie and TV related data . There is trivia along with blooper information and detailed breakdowns of both actors and characters . Amazon points out in its release that Jurassic Park holds the record for most trivia stored . We have used X-Ray on the Kindle Fire 8.9 , and we have to say that it 's really rather good . The experience is a tiny bit like a DVD commentary , but you can glance at it when it suits you , and without distracting yourself too much from the movie . That 's even more convenient now it can be summoned to your TV screen , but expect grumbles from your spouse , because there 's always one person in a room who gets cross about this sort of thing . Your Fire TV will need an update for this to work . You 'll get notified of that , or you can force a check . We tried to get it on our Fire TV Stick , but no dice , sadly . There 's also some other great features included in the update . We 've mentioned them in more detail before , but they include : Bluetooth audio support - listen to your Fire TV audio output via Bluetooth headphones . USB storage - you can now put games and other apps on a USB stick to free-up space on your box . Captive portal - which allows you to use webpage protected hotel Wi-Fi , by popping up a box for you to enter login details .

Amazon is ready to take the fight to IBM Watson Analytics ' artificial intelligence through an easy-to-implement machine learning service geared toward developers . Unveiled on Thursday , Amazon Machine Learning gives developers the chance to extract much more meaningful insights from their Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) hosted data without needing a background in data science and it is charged on a pay-as-you-go basis . Developers are required to create a model , which can be done using Amazon Machine Learning 's APIs and wizards combined with data stored on Amazon S3 , Redshift or RDS . Developers can then use that to apply predictions and extract data , plus they can alter variables inside the wizards in order to draw the most appropriate predictions possible . The system supports a trio of distinct predictions to cover all bases . Binary classification predicts one of two outcomes ( e.g . a yes or no ) , multi-class classification can predict three or more outcomes ( e.g . is this product a book , a movie , or an article of clothing ? ) , and regression is able to predict a number ( e.g . how many 27-inch monitors should we place in inventory ? ) . Predictions are priced in two ways . Batch predictions , which covers a group of predictions provided at once , cost $ 0.10 per 1,000 predictions . Real-time predictions , which can handle predictions on demand , cost $ 0.10 per 1,000 but also incur a charge of $ 0.001 per hour for every 10MB provisioned for your model . Amazon 's decision to enter the machine learning is a clear nod to the success enjoyed by Microsoft 's Azure Machine Learning , launched in July 2014 , and IBM 's renowned Watson Analytics service that has been growing quickly .

Amazon Prime Instant Video has a rocky history with Android . First it was only available on iOS , and then , when it did come to Android , it was limited to Amazon Fire tablets and Android phones , but not most Android tablets . That changes today , as the latest version of the Prime Instant Video app is now available on all Android tablets . The app is still slightly gated - it requires you to go through Amazon.com in a web browser before actually playing a video in the Prime Instant Video app - but at least it works on more devices . And you still have to get it through the Amazon Appstore instead of Google Play , but hey , at least things got a little bit better today . Thankfully there are plenty of other options for watching Prime Instant Video . It 's not natively supported , but when you mirror your entire device to a TV using Chromecast , you can even stream Prime content to the big screen . Via Android Police

It 's that time of year again . Google I/O , the annual developer conference when the tech giant unveils its next batch of products and services to the community , is about to get under way . Demos , workshops and sneak peeks over the two-day event help software developers get familiar with new offerings while giving end-users an idea of what 's to come from the Mountain View firm over the rest of 2015 and beyond . Google 's ambitions have always stretched far beyond search , encompassing email , office productivity software and even self-driving cars . But the front on which we 're going to feel its presence more and more – and where it will battle most fiercely with Apple and Amazon for dominance – will be the living room . Betting that its origin and strength in search will provide a crucial advantage over those rivals , Google 's chance at victory depends on how well it can mine search data to serve up personalized recommendations for what users will want to watch and listen to ( essentially predicting mood and taste ) at any given time . The three components of Google 's bridge to the living room are Chromecast , Google Cast and Android TV . Since last year , rumors have been circulating of a new Chromecast , with an upgrade to the 5GHz Wi-Fi spectrum . If that 's what Google plans to show off on Thursday , an upgrade to 5GHz Wi-Fi should impact its Achilles ' heels : poor quality HD streaming . But we 're not likely to see an answer for the second glaring shortfall : a noticeable absence of an Amazon Prime Instant Video app in the Chromecast store . The original Chromecast was unveiled two years ago and quickly became a breakout hit . Since then , consumers have hit the `` cast '' button more than 650 million times , while 6,000 developers have created more than 10,000 apps for the Chromecast store . The device 's success with consumers can primarily be attributed to two factors : price and convenience . The small stick plugs into your TV 's HDMI port and makes it possible to broadcast streaming video ( e.g . Mad Men episodes via the Netflix app ) or audio ( say , your favorite Pandora stations ) from your mobile device of choice to your biggest screen . From the beginning , Chromecast has been agnostic about what device you use to stream , meaning you can cast from compatible apps on iPad , iPhone , or even Surface devices – not just Android . The software that makes Chromecast possible will see new applications , specifically in the form of native integration with high quality speaker systems from LG . Rumor has it that LG 's new Google Cast-ready soundbars and speaker systems will range in price from $ 179 ( about £116 , AU $ 230 ) to $ 999 ( about £650 , AU $ 1,300 ) and are intended as an alternative to the Sonos line . However , notably absent from the Google Cast line of compatible apps is Spotify . We might also hear more about Sony 's batch of Google 's Cast-compatible receivers and speakers . But , because they also support rivals ' Spotify Connect and Apple Airtime , we might not hear as much about them . Finally we have Android TV , Google 's opportunity to meaningfully distinguish itself after false starts with Google TV . Last year , we were first brought news of Android TV at I/O and plans for direct integrations into hardware through manufacturers like Sony , Sharp , and TPVision . Since then , we 've seen it mature into Google 's version of an OS for the big screen . At the most basic level , the system integrates video on-demand streaming services like Netflix without needing a Chromecast , but also includes apps like Sling TV – a service that will look very similar to Apple 's rumored plans for a `` narrow '' cable offering on Apple TV – and games into one place . But the more interesting questions are around what an all-encompassing living room OS will look like . In addition to voice search and optimizing font and image sizes for users who are sitting more than 10 feet from the screen , Google is giving prime placement on the home screen to video games and recommendations based upon viewing history . Android TV 's incredibly skilled at figuring out what I 'm searching for before I can finish typing my query , so I 'm interested to see how that knowledge gets applied to suggesting what I might want to watch tonight . The gaming aspect is exciting on a wholly different level though , because it completes the circle in terms of making the home theater truly interactive . The games Google chooses to showcase and develop will give us a deeper sense of how Google 's ambitions relate to transforming human behavior – beyond just delivering what we already know we want , but into enticing us to use our free time in new ways . Ultimately , that 's the big picture for Google 's home entertainment efforts . Where Apple has its product ecosystem and powerful partners and Amazon has its incredible value plays through Prime , Google looks to leverage its immense influence in the search space to empower the living room .

If you thought the idea of barking commands into a cylindrical black box to order supplies from Amazon was strange , get a load of what Google may be planning for the next generation of internet-connected smart toys . The US Patent and Trademark Office ( via Engadget ) published a patent application from Google late last week entitled `` Agent Interfaces for Interactive Electronics that Support Social Cues , '' which could wind up being little more than child 's play . Effectively an internet-connected , voice-activated device not unlike Amazon Echo , the Google patent describes `` an anthropomorphic device , perhaps in the form factor of a doll or toy , may be configured to control one or more media devices . '' Unlike Echo , such smart toys could be configured to respond to movement through the use of a camera , as well as spoken words or phrases from a microphone attached to the head of the device . Naturally , Google 's device would be able to communicate with a server on its network , allowing the smart toy to transmit commands to other connected media devices so it 's as functional as it is cute . `` Cute '' is definitely what Google seems to be going for here , describing the device as an `` attractive user interface '' for young children , thanks to its disguise as `` cartoonish dolls or toys , '' although `` other physical appearances '' are also at least hinted at . Taking it one step further , the smart toy could `` express curiosity , ( it ) may tilt its head , furrow its brow , and/or scratch its head with an arm '' in response to a child 's commands , which certainly sounds like the beginning of a bad horror movie to us . That 's exactly how an attorney for Big Brother Watch described potential privacy concerns with the smart toys to BBC last week , but it 's unclear what , if anything , Google engineers may have done since the original patent filing in 2012 to address them .

Amazon has gone to great lengths ( read : drones ) to deliver your ordered goods as fast as possible , even going as far as promising same-day delivery with Prime Now . But sometimes , there ’ s just no getting around traffic . So , what kind of magic trick does the company pull at this point ? Hopping on public transportation , of course . The Financial Times reported that in New York City , Amazon has begun resorting to the subway in order to squeak by the most dreaded traffic zones . If you ’ re a daily commuter , you could soon be sharing a ride along with carts full of Amazon packages that are small enough on subway cars . While I wouldn ’ t necessarily consider the NYC subways to be the speediest option available , it ’ s usually the most time-efficient . Choosing this rather utilitarian method of travel is an interesting move by the e-commerce company to help keep your packages moving along . I just wish they had thought outside the box a bit for this one . The subway tunnels seem ripe for its drones to buzz around in . Via Engadget

Get ready to accidentally order a bunch of stuff from Amazon , folks . The e-tailer giant 's Amazon Echo speaker can now buy items for you via your voice . There are a few caveats though . You must be a Prime member and only Prime eligible items can be bought . The new service is also only available in the US right now . Technically , Alexa can only reorder items you 've already purchased but it looks like a workaround enables you to trick Alexa into offering up alternative options if it ca n't find the item you 're looking for . There 's also a safeguard in place where you can use your Wake word , then say `` cancel '' to stop the order from going through if you 've accidentally made a purchase .
Walmart has unveiled its plans for an unlimited shipping service to compete with Amazon Prime , at half the cost . Prime has been king of the proverbial mountain when it comes to delivering goods to your doorstep fast , but Walmart will begin testing its rival service this summer at $ 50 , essentially half the price of Prime ( $ 99 ) . Walmart 's service , codenamed `` Tahoe , '' will offer shipping on over a million of its top-selling items , compared to the 7 million products on its online store . The service will be offered by invitation only to start . Walmart says that it plans on the service delivering customers ' orders within three days , which is a bit more vague and potentially frustrating than Prime 's straight-shooting , free two-day shipping . Granted , once in a blue moon Amazon has issues with following through on this promise , but overall , Amazon users are used to the exactness that Prime sells . For this , and the fact that it lacks video and music streaming , Walmart is sure to be in for an uphill battle in poaching loyal subscribers from Amazon . Tahoe will most likely find its market in new users looking to save on daily essentials . Although parallels to Amazon 's key features are missing from the first edition of Tahoe , Walmart may extend it beyond shipping , if all goes well in its testing . According to The Information , who first reported Walmart 's shipping service , Walmart hopes to add its video streaming service , Vudu . The world 's largest retailer looks to include same-day grocery delivery as well , which it already offers in five test markets . Walmart is working to reach the modern generation of shoppers with this new rival to Amazon Prime , but has a ways to go before it rivals the immediacy that Prime offers online . Even on Walmart 's site in the past , the retailer has struggled to meet its own shipping deadlines . However , Tahoe may have a chance to gain a foothold with new users ( and Walmart frequenters ) with its greatly reduced price compared to Prime . Via Reuters Lead image credit Walmart

You wo n't even need to go to your door to receive a package if Amazon 's plans for drone deliveries come to fruition . The online retail giant 's patents for parcel delivery by UAV have just been published by the US patent office , yielding a few new details on how the system will operate . Drones will use data from your smartphone to work out your exact location and take your parcel right there . Different drones will also be able to communicate between each other to discuss traffic and weather conditions . If you do n't want the package brought straight to you , that 's an option . You can tell the drone you 'd rather have it dropped off at your home , workplace , or even `` my boat '' . If you change your mind halfway through delivery , there should n't be a problem - the drones can update their routes in real-time . While progress has been slow , due to the US Federal Aviation Authority 's reticence to approve commercial use of drone technology , there are signs that it 's softening . Amazon was granted permission to test-fly its drones in the US in March , albeit within the pilot 's line of site and no higher than 122 metres . Plus , this week , the agency permitted unmanned helicopters to be used for crop-spraying , and announced plans for news-gathering drones in partnership with CNN . It is also planning to test commercial drones that can fly beyond the line of sight of their operators for inspecting railways .

An experimental suborbital spacecraft has been launched by Blue Origin , a startup owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , in an attempt to explore the possibility of commercial space travel . The craft , called New Shepard , took off from a test facility near Van Horn in Texas on the evening of 29 April 2015 . It rose to an altitude of 93 kilometres before the capsule separated and fell back to Earth with a parachute . Blue Origin used a liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen fuelled rocket to get the capsule into space . That succeeded , with Bezos saying in a statement : `` Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return . '' But the return of the rocket did n't go so well . `` We lost pressure in our hydraulic system on descent , '' Bezos added . `` Fortunately , we 've already been in work for some time on an improved hydraulic system . We 'll be ready to fly again soon . '' New Shepard is due to be flown many more times before test pilots will be put on board . Once testing is complete however , it should be able to fly three people or a mix of passengers and payloads into suborbital space . Blue Origin is just one of a number of companies exploring the possibilities of commercial spaceflight . The best-known is probably Elon Musk 's SpaceX , but Boeing , Virgin Galactic and XCOR Aerospace all have their eyes set on the heavens .

When Amazon first released the Amazon Echo , one of the main gripes we had was that Alexa , the company 's voice-controlled AI rival to Siri and Cortana , acted more like a novelty than a fully functioning virtual assistant . Things looks to be changing , however , with Amazon 's announcements today that it 's freeing up Alexa in hopes to build up the ecosystem . The company has made a free Alexa SDK available , which will allow third-party developers to build their own app support for the platform . Amazon is also opening up Alexa to third-party manufacturers with Alexa Voice Services , meaning we 'll likely be seeing Alexa on non-Amazon-branded hardware in the future . Amazon also announced the Alexa Fund today , a $ 100 million investment `` to support developers , manufacturers , and start-ups of all sizes who are passionate about creating new experiences designed around the human voice , '' the company said . There are already seven companies on-board with initial investments , with specialties ranging from children 's toys , connected cars , home security systems and personal fitness . This should give you an idea of where we may find Alexa next , or at least where Amazon hopes to find its personal assistant in the future .

HDR is considered the wave of the future for television ( sorry , 4K ) , and Amazon just took the biggest step yet towards bringing high dynamic range content to viewers . Mozart in the Jungle ( Season 1 ) and the Red Oaks pilot are stepping out in HDR starting today on Samsung SUHD TVs , Amazon announced . It plans to make more Prime series available in HDR soon as well as add more compatible devices throughout the year . The HDR shows are available to US Prime members at no extra cost . In addition to a Samsung SUHD TV , users will also need the Amazon Video app to stream in HDR . While Netflix has promised to deliver HDR content this year , Amazon beat it to the punch by bringing the first HDR TV or movie to the masses . Samsung plans to offer up UHD movies at some point , though specifics are sorely lacking as to when that will be , how much it will cost or what movies will be available . LG also announced today it will add Amazon HDR streaming to its 2015 OLED 4K Utra HD TVs `` in the coming weeks . '' Whereas 4K focuses on pixels , HDR provides better contrast , enhances highlights and deepens shadows for richer colors . But like 4K , content is a sticking point , though that 's starting to turn around somewhat given today 's announcement . Via CNET

Over the last two decades , Amazon has changed the way people buy things ; the company , whose name is almost synonymous with e-commerce , stocks millions of items . From audio books to baby nappies and even online movies , it has spawned an ecosystem worth tens of billions of dollars in annual revenues globally . While the online retailer often has the cheapest prices online , that is not always the case and more often than not , Amazon aficionados are guilty of not trying hard enough to get the best deal online . This short guide provides some hints on how you can squeeze even more value from your money at Amazon and provides a few tips about some of Amazon 's tricks . NUS card holders get a 5 % discount on millions of Amazon items and 10 % off Amazon Clothing . They need to go to the NUS Extra website and grab the discount codes which has then to be used on Amazon 's website . Note that codes are not stackable and some departments ( like Electronics and Computers ) , Kindle books and Marketplace/3rd party products are excluded from the list . Students can also enrol on Amazon Student scheme to get free one-day delivery for six months and after that , 50 % off Amazon Prime . Amazon has a little known scheme called `` subscribe and save '' , one that applies mostly for groceries and children products although you can also get discounts on office consumables . There are two saving tiers ; grab 1-4 subscriptions in one month and save 5 % ; 5 or more subscriptions triples that saving to 15 % . You can cancel subscriptions at any time . Bear in mind though that you may lose out on any price changes and 3rd party resellers may turn out to be cheaper than Amazon 's ( for example , this Samsung M40 ink cartridge which costs nearly twice the price on Amazon S & S ) . It 's worth noting that sometimes , prices listed on the `` Other Sellers tab '' are actually cheaper than on the main area of the page . Also , always check on the `` new '' section of the page for potential savings . Speaking of savings , keep an eye on fluctuating prices as Amazon practices dynamic pricing with prices going up or down depending on demand . A useful site that tracks Amazon 's prices ( more than 18 million products ) and provides with tools to alert you when your wish list products hit a threshold is Camel Camel Camel . Not surprisingly , Amazon gift cards are one of the more popular virtual reward schemes around . Even Microsoft uses them for their Bing Rewards ( only in the US though ) and countless companies in the UK offer gift cards to entice customers or as an alternative to cashbacks . You can buy gift cards from eBay , from Zeek ( a small but growing gift voucher marketplace ) or put a `` want to buy '' request on popular UK website Hotukdeals . For eBay , always use your credit card for purchases above £100 as your credit card company is jointly accountable should the transaction fall through . Amazon has a separate warehouse deal and outlet section ( not sure why they would n't just merge those two ) . The first one offers open-box customer returned , warehouse damaged merchandise while the second one deals in markdowns , clearance items , closeouts and overstocks . While the latter essentially redirects to the main website , the former provides with a list of used products , are of variable quality and stock is usually very limited . All purchases eligible for Amazon customer service and a 30-day return policy plus you should be able to use the various codes on there as well . Curiua is a clever online service that compares prices for Amazon in France , Germany , Italy and Spain , converting them in pounds . The website has been named after a Portuguese explorer who was the first European to travel up the entire length of the Amazon ( as in the river ) . Unbeknown to many you can actually get much cheaper deals ( especially on smartphones ) in mainland Europe . Because UK is still part of the EU , you do n't need to pay extra taxes and warranty is usually upheld across the continent so that if your German-purchased Galaxy S6 breaks down , you can still get it covered here . Unlike Camel Camel Camel , the site does n't unfortunately have a `` best deals '' section yet which makes it hard to find deals . As for the bargains , the LG G3 Gold ( 3GB/32GB ) costs £255.32 in Spain or £275 in the UK . It is also advisable that you use a credit card that does n't charge any fees for the conversion . A flurry of services has emerged over the past few years that allow users to receive pitches , similar to reverse bidding . Flubit , Avast ! SafePrice , Beat My Price by Barclays are UK-only ones and once you have submitted your request - usually a URL - to the wider seller community on these websites , you will start getting propositions , usually within 24 hours . You can either choose to buy from Amazon or from the three aforementioned websites . Note that the services by them do not work for contracts , downloadable material , fashion or second hand products . If you 're all about serendipity , then why not try Money Saving Expert 's Amazon Discount Finder which creates a bespoke result page containing deals , in a particular category , that have been discounted by as much as 80 % . You can change a few parameters including pricing and the sort order . Unfortunately we could n't get any decent deals going on but given that there 's millions of product lines in Amazon 's database , there 's bound to be something for everyone . Amazon was one of the pioneers of online user-generated reviews , coming up with great schemes like Vine which allows prolific buyers to get free products for testing and reporting . Customer reviews , while mostly beneficial , can also prove to be misleading sometimes . This is especially true for products that have a long shelf-life or have been on the market for a long time and have been through a number of iterations . That 's the case , for example , for products that have had firmware updates ( phones or motherboards ) or are available in various iterations under the same stock keeping unit ( hard disk drives , laptops etc ) . Amazon has just come up with a new service called Amazon Vouchers which is different from Amazon Gift cards . Add a voucher to your basket , select the associated product ( from a wide range of products ) and proceed to checkout where the discount is automatically applied . There are actually some interesting vouchers that can be used with the other Amazon saving schemes ( S & S or student discount ) . For example , there ’ s £15 off the Motorola MBP27T digital video baby monitor that brings down the price to £85 , far cheaper than the rest of the market .
Amazon Echo , the e-commerce site 's ambitious , but flawed voice-controlled Bluetooth speaker is now available for pre-order in the US . The device had a soft launch earlier this year , and was only available by invite only . After a few months and some much-needed improvements to the Alexa-powered device , that barrier to entry has finally lowered . If you live in the US , Amazon is now accepting pre-orders for the device , which runs for $ 180 . No word yet on an international release , but we 've reached out for a statement . The idea of an intelligent Bluetooth speaker that can connect you to the vast selection of goods and services that Amazon offers is one that 's admittedly pretty tempting to buy into . But should you ? It depends . The price has dropped $ 20 since its early 2015 introduction . Also , Echo 's internal AI , named Alexa , ( think Siri ) is getting smarter and more capable by the day . It 's much improved from the aforementioned soft launch , the intelligent personal assistant can now set alarms , recite scores and schedules for your favorite sports team and can even control some connected home tech with nothing but your voice . If this all sounds great , you 'll love the Echo . On the other hand , the Bluetooth speaker lacks mobility , as it needs to be tethered to the wall at all times by a power adapter . But if that 's the price to pay for a speaker with voice-powered smarts , then we 're totally alright with that .

In a bid to try and keep up with the runaway leaders in the video streaming game , Amazon is looking to seriously expand its investment in original programming for its Prime Instant Video service . At the launch of this year 's London Technology Week , Jay Marine , VP of Instant Video in Europe , told CNBC it was going to `` double down '' on the amount of money it spends on programming . It 's going to `` invest more to bring our customers worldwide more originals , more great TV series than they have never been able to see before , '' said Marine . The last year saw Amazon invest $ 1.3 billion in its streaming service , producing award-winning shows like Transparent and even managed to woo nervous New York luminary Woody Allen into the fold to create bespoke TV . Doubling that investment to nearly $ 3 billion sounds like one hell of an investment and with nigh-on 14 million subscribers to keep happy the numbers are looking pretty good ... ... until you start looking at the numbers the big Netflix dogs are throwing around . With over 60 million subscribers and a spend of around $ 10 billion in the past year you can see why Amazon needs to start upping its game , and why it needs to start making sure all those standard Amazon Prime subs are making use of its Instant Video service . If those overall numbers are n't scary enough for Amazon folk a recently released estimate of US primetime streaming traffic by Sandvine pegged Netflix 's share at 36.5 % in peak evening viewing hours with Instant Prime Video batting at just 1.97 % . Looks like doubling down may not quite be enough ... via Home Media Magazine

Do you pay much attention to the star ratings left by previous purchasers when shopping for stuff on Amazon ? The e-commerce giant has told CNET that those star ratings are being tweaked to be more useful . Newer reviews get more priority over older reviews , while ratings left by `` verified Amazon purchasers '' will also carry extra weight . Reviews upvoted by other users get pushed to the top too . `` The system will learn what reviews are most helpful to customers ... and it improves over time , '' Amazon spokeswoman Julie Law told CNET . `` It 's all meant to make customer reviews more useful . '' It means the five-star rating you see next to an HDMI cable or Game of Thrones Blu-ray disc may change more regularly as newer reviews and ratings arrive . The updated system has already begun rolling out in the US - as yet Amazon has n't confirmed if it 's going to appear on other regional sites . Presumably it 's going to wait and see how it does first . For a lot of us , user reviews play a major role in purchasing decisions , and Amazon has thought long and hard about how to make them more effective . The most valuable ratings and reviews should appear first in the queue from now on .

Amazon has launched a new version of its flagship ereader , the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite , with a greatly enhanced display and better layouts . Starting at £109.99/ $ 119 with special offers for the Wi-Fi only version , and rising to £179.99/ $ 209.99 if you ditch offers and add 3G connectivity , the Paperwhite inherits the pricing structure of its name-sake predecessor . The main talking point on the all-new Kindle Paperwhite is its 6-inch display , which packs in two times more pixels resulting in a 300ppi density . That means text will look sharper than ever , and Amazon has also introduced a new font , Bookerly , which it hopes will be even easier on your eyes . There 's good news for authors too as Amazon has brought in a new typesetting engine , allowing more control over the layout of text on screen . In terms of design , size and weight there 's not much of a difference between the 2013 and 2015 Paperwhite models , while Amazon claims it 's still good for `` weeks of battery life '' - even with the higher resolution display and backlight . Prettier layouts , a new font and a higher resolution display - books are going to look great on the new Paperwhite . It 's not an essential upgrade for current owners , but it looks like it will keep Amazon on top of the ereader game . You can pre-order the all new Kindle Paperwhite now , with stock expected to ship from June 30 .

After the colossal fail that was the Amazon Fire Phone , where I personally think our 2.5 star review was pretty lenient , I need something big to prick up my ears before I even consider returning to the Amazon realm for a look around . Amazon started clearing stock of the phone a few weeks back by dropping the price down to £99 ( about $ 150 , AU $ 198 ) suggesting we may be about to see a second iteration . If it 's on the cards , it 's going to need some serious work to do well . The latest patent suggests Amazon is working on a way to unlock your phone with your ear – a novel idea , but it 's not enough . It likely wo n't be ready to reach the Fire Phone 2 but the feature sums up everything Amazon is doing wrong in the phone market . Amazon 's Fire Phone was many things but it got a lot of the basics wrong , especially the design . Focusing on features like this was one of the main reasons the Fire Phone failed . There was too much focus on pointless fluff . The likes of Firefly and Dynamic Perspective are interesting concepts but they 're not the reason anyone would buy a phone . Do you really want that kind of technology to take precedence over the design of your handset ? Having those four cameras plastered in each corner restricted the design of the first phone and meant unsightly massive bezels to complement the four unnerving cameras staring at you . With the new technology what if my ear is n't scanning properly ? Fingerprint sensors started off as unresponsive , pointless features so head-scanning is bound to have a similar learning curve . Amazon 's first attempts at 'innovation ' did n't light up our world , and based on that I do n't want to be missing calls just because my lobe was n't in the right position . Actually , when would you ever even need to unlock your phone for a phone call ? No smartphone asks for your identity to answer calls at the moment so is it something we really need ? I can understand you might not want anyone being able to pick up your phone and answer but it 's certainly not the number one problem we need sorting on smartphones right now . Why is n't Amazon focusing its efforts on creating a gorgeous piece of design ? Or making the best battery life ever seen on a phone ? Or even just digging in and working harder on its own Fire OS ? I 'm concerned that if Amazon opts to make a new Fire Phone it will focus attention on the weird and wonderful again . Those things are fine , it 's what inspires innovation and gives us the brand new features we desire a few years down the line ... but come on , Amazon , you need to nail the basics first . I want the online retailer to head back to the drawing board with the Fire Phone 2 . Do n't throw in a bunch of new features and hope a good looking advert narrated by a smarmy celebrity will make it sell based on pure curiosity .
Amazon has added another VM instance to its AWS ( Amazon Web Services ) cloud computing platform . M4 , as it is known , uses custom Intel Xeon Haswell-based processors ; the E5-2676 v3 is clocked at 2.4GHz and appears to be a variant of the 2670 . It comes with 30MB of L2 cache , 12 cores/24 threads and support for 768GB of system memory . Five instances are available , with the largest , m4.10xlarge , offering up to 40 virtual CPUs and 160GB of memory as well as dedicated bandwidth via Amazon 's EBS ( Elastic Block Store ) and a 10Gb connection . AWS , which turns 10 next year , offers nearly 40 instances , some of them with storage and some like the m4.10xlarge , without . The cloud computing giant has also improved its networking performance by offering a new feature called Enhanced Networking which promises a higher packet per second performance , lower network jitter and lower network latencies . The latter is particularly desirable for gaming servers or business applications like SAP or Microsoft SharePoint . Prices vary according to location ; the cheapest m4.large instance costs $ 0.139 per hour ( EU Ireland data centre ) while the most expensive one costs $ 2.78 per hour . In comparison , the most affordable Amazon instance , t2.micro is available for rent for a mere $ 0.0.14 per hour . Users can cut down on costs by reserving instances on up to 3-year term saving up to 57 % ( but having to pay everything upfront ) .
Amazon is on a quest to find new parts of your body to unlock a smartphone , and it 's getting further up your torso with every attempt . The online retailer has filed a new patent that includes technology to unlock your phone if it 's placed against your ear - an offering which sounds pretty redundant if you ask us . According to the science people your ear can be as unique as a fingerprint , so it 's an accurate way to identify yourself and it 'll be possible to unlock your phone as you put it there for a phone call . But it 's going to have to be reliable ; you do n't want to be trying to access a phone call and fumbling around your ear to get it to work . Just remember how temperamental fingerprint sensors were when they first appeared . The technology will also read how close the phone is to your ear and adjusts the speaker volume accordingly . Amazon 's Fire Phone flopped in terms of sales and did not impress critics , we gave it a 2.5 out of 5 , so the company needs a big USP to sell the sequel on . Via The Next Web

Amazon Game Studios is assembling a crack team of developers to work on what it 's calling an `` ambitious new PC game project . '' This unknown PC title will be Amazon 's first entry into the genre . The studio 's primary focus until this point has been publishing high-quality , pay-to-play mobile games . Its latest release , a horror game called Til Morning 's Light , stands as a particularly impressive example in mobile gaming . Amazon detailed the high-profile development team it 's putting together in a post to Gamasutra . Notable names include Clint Hocking , designer of the effervescent Far Cry , and Kim Swift , designer of the legendary game Portal . The team also includes developers who have worked on heavyweight game titles , including World of Warcraft , BioShock , Halo and The Last of Us . Also in the post , Amazon says it 's committed to `` building great teams who are excited to use Twitch , the AWS ( Amazon Web Services ) cloud , and technical innovation to radically evolve gameplay . '' Amazon acquired the game-streaming service Twitch last year for just shy of a billion dollars , indicating that Amazon has big plans in mind for the software . Amazon Game Studios says it 's `` looking to take risks , and invent '' and is seeking more interested people to join its team . Maybe the next big PC gaming release will indeed come at the hands of Amazon ? Lead image credit : Amazon Game Studio Via The Verge
In just 10 days , you might be buying a new Xbox One with 1TB of storage , a redesigned controller and Halo : The Master Chief Collection for $ 400 . Amazon appears to be holding a spot for a new Xbox One console set to release on June 15 , conveniently the same day as its E3 2015 showcase . According to the low-profile listing , the bundle includes the storage-wealthy console , Halo : The Master Chief Collection and the highly anticipated redesigned controller with a 3.5mm headset port built in . When asked about the mystery listing , a Microsoft executive said , `` We 're gearing up for an exciting E3 where we 'll showcase more games and experiences . We have nothing further to share at this time . '' Last year , Microsoft had a similar release with a Call-of-Duty-style Xbox One with 1TB of storage , but it was priced at $ 500 and predated the updated controller . At $ 400 , this Xbox One bundle looks like the deal to beat . Via Engadget

Just four days after Nvidia launched its new Shield Android TV console , set-top box competitor Amazon is firing back with a game-streaming solution of its own : GameFly Streaming . Amazon announced today that GameFly will be its exclusive partner for its media streaming device , the Amazon Fire TV . Like Nvidia Grid , the game-streaming service on the new Shield console , GameFly will provide PC versions of games like Batman : Arkham City , Darksiders II and Dirt 3 directly to gamers ' living rooms . Instead of paying a subscription fee , however , GameFly will sell game packs - packages of seven games , which start at $ 6.99 a month . At launch customers can choose from six gaming packs like LEGO - which includes seven LEGO titles - or Speed , which includes games like GRID 2 , Moto GP '13 and Ridge Racer Unbounded . The only catch here is that the GameFly service works only in conjunction with the Amazon Fire TV Game Controller , which costs an additional $ 40 . The service goes live today , and we 'll up our review shortly with our hands on impressions .

Whether you 're an avid TV watcher or a full-time Netflix binger , we all have one thing in common : We like great content . ( See : Best shows on Netflix . ) We want comedies that make us laugh until we cry and dramas that keep us on the edge of our seats until they resolve in a way that makes us feel somewhat closer to the millionaire actors and actresses on the screen . We want these things and in return we give these shows our adoration in the form of the Emmy Awards , the pinnacle of any primetime television actor , actress , director or editor 's career . This year , the 67th Emmy Awards are slated for September 12 and will recognize shows from both traditional cable companies and streaming services like Netflix and Amazon for their contribution to the culture of television . Instead of rounding up every single show on the red carpet like some other sites , we 've gone ahead and isolated the Emmy-nominated shows that are available to watch right this second on the biggest streaming services around , plus added our own predictions as to who we think will take home a trophy . What 's it nominated for ? Outstanding Drama Series , Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series , Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama - Kevin Spacey , Outstanding Actress in a Drama - Robin Wright , Best Guest Actor in a Drama Series - Reg E. Cathey , Best Guest Actress in a Drama Series - Kate Mara Does it stand a shot of winning ? House of Cards suffered a huge disappointment at last year 's event , losing the award for Outstanding Drama Series to the last season of AMC 's Breaking Bad . While the competition is n't nearly as tight this year , the Number 1 contender for the top trophy is HBO 's Mad Men , which has been nominated for the award every year and has yet to take home the coveted statue . If House of Cards ca n't take home the award for Outstanding Drama , chances are good its two lead players , Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright , will win consolation prizes in their respective categories . Where you can watch it : Netflix What 's it nominated for ? Outstanding Drama Series , Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series , Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama - Uzo Aduba , Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama - Pablo Schreiber Does it stand a shot of winning ? I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but Orange is the New Black does n't stand a chance in the Outstanding Drama category . With juggernauts like Game of Thrones , Homeland and Mad Men vying for the one statue , there 's just no room for an underdog like OITNB . Where I could see it pulling off a victory is in the Supporting Actress category thanks to Uzo Aduba 's laugh-out-loud character Suzanne `` Crazy-Eyes '' Warren . Where you can watch it : Netflix What 's it nominated for ? Outstanding Comedy Series , Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series , Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series , Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series , Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series - Jeffrey Tambor , Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series - Gaby Hoffmann , Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series - Bradley Whitford Does it stand a shot of winning ? It 's tough to imagine an Emmy Award Show where Transparent goes home without a statue in hand . It 's a shoe-in for Outstanding Writing in its genre as well as Casting for putting together such a heart-felt and natural-feeling crew . Winning the two major categories , Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actor , will be a bit of an uphill battle with popular favorites like Silicon Valley and Netflix 's Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt in close contention . That said , if Jeffrey Tambor does n't bring home a trophy for his work playing Maura Pfefferman , the Television Academy should be downright ashamed of itself . Where you can watch it : Amazon Prime Instant Video What 's it nominated for ? Outstanding Comedy Series , Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series , Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series - Tituss Burgess , Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series - Jane Krakowski , Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series - Jon Hamm , Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series - Tina Fey , Outstanding Stunt Coordination for a Comedy Series Does it stand a shot of winning ? While I 'd like to hope Tituss Burgess will scoop the win for his hilarious , flamboyant and all-around awesome performance as Ellie Kemper 's roommate , he could be ousted by the heavily favored Keegan-Michael Key or Adam Driver . Should Burgess not snag a trophy of his own , there 's a distinct possibility of the show getting a nod for its casting or any number of supporting or guest actors , which includes Mad Men 's Jon Hamm for his appearance in four episodes . Where you can watch it : Netflix What 's it nominated for ? Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series - Lily Tomlin Does it stand a shot of winning ? Tomlin has had a storied career winning both a handful of Emmys for her work in the 1970s and more recently was nominated for four Grammys for her stand-up comedy albums This Is a Recording , Modern Scream , And That 's the Truth and On Stage . Despite her years of success and ultimately charming portrayal of an aging woman dealing with her husband 's recent announcement that he 's in love with his law partner , this year 's award is anything but a gim me . Facing down leading ladies like Lisa Kudrow , Julia Louis-Dreyfus , Amy Poehler and Amy Schumer , it 's a tough call who in this category will come out on top . Where you can watch it : Netflix What 's it nominated for ? Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series , Outstanding Visual Effects in a Supporting Role Does it stand a shot of winning ? If Daredevil wins a pair of awards it wo n't be because it 's as flashy or overblown as its competition *cough* Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead . No , in both its special effects and its sound design , Daredevil , like its protagonist Matt Murdock , is above all else subtle and effective . But subtlety might not be enough when you 're going up against the behemoth that is Game of Thrones , a show that practically steamrolled its way to five awards at last year 's show . Let 's say this : It has a fighting chance . Where you can watch it : Netflix What 's it nominated for ? Outstanding Documentary , Outstanding Cinematography for Non-Fiction Programming Does it stand a shot of winning ? OK , let 's be honest : you probably do n't care which film wins the award for Outstanding Cinematography for Non-Fiction Programming , or find yourself rooting for Virunga to win the genre against documentaries like The Case Against 8 or HBO 's Kurt Cobain : Montage of Heck . And that 's OK . I did n't either . But watch the film and you 'll understand how crucial it is for experimental projects like Leonardo DiCaprio 's Virunga to win an Emmy , if only so companies like Netflix will take more risks when deciding where to invest money . If the 100 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes or 95 % on Metacritic are n't enough to persuade you that this film about a team of park rangers fighting against the big oil corporations ' private military troops should take home a trophy , give it a watch this weekend and have a box of tissues handy . Where you can watch it : Netflix What 's it nominated for ? Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking Does it stand a shot of winning ? With only three nominees , one would think it would n't be too hard to walk away with something to show for it in this category . Unfortunately , when you 're going up against an Edward Snowden biopic , CitizenFour , and The Great Invisible , a documentary on the oil explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , it 's not exactly `` easy '' to get by on shock value alone . Thankfully Hot Girls Wanted brings more to the table than its name suggests , showing viewers the tragedies and exploitation in the amateur porn industry . If it does n't win , well , CitizenFour would n't be a bad choice , either . Where you can watch it : Netflix

We 'll admit , we really thought Amazon 's Dash Button was an April Fool 's joke . It 's nothing against the product ( a small , wirelessly connected strip that allows you to order a specific product from Amazon with a single button press ) , it just seemed too strange to be true . Well whatever we thought it originally , it turned out to be real . Starting today Amazon has officially made its Dash Buttons available to the US Amazon Prime members for $ 4.99 . ( Unfortunately there 's no word yet on when this time-saving device could come overseas , but it likely wo n't take long . ) So far , Amazon is selling Dash Buttons for Tide detergent , Cottonelle toilet paper , Glad trash bags along with 15 other household products from Keurig coffee cups and bottled water to baby diapers and razor blades . You 'll be able to customize how much of a product is ordered and specify exactly what product you want - say , for instance , you want a specific blend of coffee instead of the generic stuff week after week . Decide you do n't need that fifth bundle of paper towels ? Amazon sends you an alert on your phone before it places the order , allowing you to cancel it if you change your mind . Via The Verge
The music streaming business in the UK is a crowded one , so there are limited ways to get your product seen . Apple recently showed you can do it , with the launch of Apple Music . But no other company in the world has a self-perpetuating hype machine like Apple does . Not even Amazon . But that did n't stop Amazon launching its streaming service in the UK this week , a year on from it arriving in the US , immediately boasting millions of subscribers . So , how did it do it ? By stealth . Amazon Prime Music UK is automatically bundled into your Prime membership . It sits alongside a number of other extras that have been added to plump Prime up , making it a service that caters to customers needs of wanting everything right now , or at the very least on a next-day delivery , which was the entire point of Prime when it first launched back in 2007 . It offers on-demand movies through Amazon Prime Instant Video , unlimited Kindle rentals and a photo archive service . All of these deliver on-tap media and now Amazon has added music-streaming into its Prime-ordial soup . Amazon is looking at music in a different way to its rivals , so much so that it does n't want to refer to Spotify and Apple Music as rivals . `` We are not trying to do the same thing as Apple Music or Spotify , '' explains Steve Bernstein , director of Amazon 's digital music services in Europe . `` They charge £120 a year , so they have to go head-to-head as it is unlikely that people will subscribe to both of those . Amazon Prime Music is trying to do something completely different . `` We are charging £79 a year for Prime , so you get 1 million songs for free plus Prime Instant Video , shipping benefits and more . '' This is a key differentiator . Amazon Prime Music has launched in the UK with far fewer tracks . Both Spotify and Apple Music have catalogue of some 30 million songs for their users to choose from but Amazon is trying to turn what could be seen as a failing as their USP . Having the service as an added extra to Prime , rather than a standalone service means that - in Amazon 's eyes at lease - it is n't 29 million songs down to other streaming services , but their customers are 1 million songs up . `` We already have millions of Prime customers in the UK and from launch of this service they now have free access to a streaming service , '' says Paul Frith , head of Music for Amazon UK . `` All 30 million tracks that are available on Spotify and others are available to buy through Amazon . What we have done with our music service is select just over a million songs that we know will be really popular with our customers . '' To make sure that as many of those songs are listened to as possible , Amazon has drafted in UK-based music journalists to curate some 500 playlists that it believes have been given a distinctly British flavour . `` The important distinction is that we are not just taking the same service in the US and releasing it to the UK , '' says Bernstein . `` We have spent a lot of time building the service from the ground up for British music customers . We have a strong sense as to what works , thanks to the data we already have on our customers . '' And that is Amazon 's tactics for Prime Music - to tailor the service to its customers needs , using its own data , regardless of whether their customers actually want it or not . `` Our message to our customers is that the best music streaming service for you is the one that you have already got . It 's called Prime Music and it is part of your subscription , '' says Frith . When the general public changes how it consumes media there is always an obvious transition . Vinyl sales died because of tape , tape made way for CD , CD for download , download for streaming . But , alongside this natural progression there is an ugly blame game , especially when businesses begin to die out . Amazon was part of this when traditional music outlets on the high street started closing . The blame was placed firmly on the internet , on online retailers pushing customers to buy with mouse clicks than footsteps . For the current state of the music industry , the internet is still to blame but it 's now the streaming giants that are bearing the brunt of criticism both from artists and record labels . Amazon is no longer where the finger is pointed , it 's Spotify . At the moment , Amazon seems content to take a backseat and do its own limited service to its current Prime user base . But you can bet execs on high are secretly wishing that one day that will change . The ones that take the biggest flack are inevitably the ones reaping the benefits from a changing industry . Amazon knows this . When it comes to music , it used to be them .

With the arrival of Amazon Launchpad , the giant e-commerce site has officially jumped into the startup space - at least as a helpful hand . The program is similar to Product Hunt , Shopify and Shyp , three sites that let startups market , ship and sell their wares . The different of course , is the weight behind Amazon 's name and likely , it 's crazy fast shipping network . Amazon Vice President Jim Adkins said in a press release : `` Amazon Launchpad gives customers access to a dedicated storefront featuring a variety of innovative new products from emerging brands . For startups , we handle inventory management , order fulfillment , customer service , and more , allowing them to focus their efforts on the innovation that results in more cool products . '' At the moment , the new storefront boasts more than 200 products from over 25 accelerators , crowd-funding platforms and venture capital firms . Notably missing is Kickstarter though Indiegogo is part of the roster . It 's possible Kickstarter will join up with the program in the future , but right now , it looks like the virtual shelves are well stocked with odd and interesting goodies . Via Business Wire

Everyone loves drones : news crews , amateur enthusiasts , Amazon . But these tiny Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) are causing plenty of headaches as pilots drift too close to airports and get in the way of the emergency services . Something has to change . Google , with a little help from its friends , wants to build an intelligent air traffic control system for drones to prevent mid-air collisions , the company has revealed to Bloomberg . More than a dozen companies are on board according to the report , including NASA , Amazon and Verizon . The idea is that drones could automatically avoid each other ( and other aircraft ) thanks to a built-in sensing and reporting system . It 's still early days for such a system but some details are expected to be thrashed out at a NASA-run conference happening next week . Google 's Dave Vos said he expects multiple networks to run alongside each other , with governments acting as supervisors . Human beings ( including Amazon delivery drivers ) will still be in charge of their machines , but if you try and fly into another drone or the White House then the safety system will kick into action . Everyone involved in the initiative knows the potential benefits of widespread drone use are huge , from delivering supplies to remote areas to getting better views of the action at the next Olympics .

Real talk : Maybe you did n't buy a subscription to Amazon Prime for its accompanying video streaming service , Amazon Prime Instant Video . It could 've been a complete afterthought , and , if we 're being honest , you might 've considered overlooking the service completely in favor of Netflix , the staple service for streaming video . First off , be glad you did n't pass up on Amazon 's video service . Just because Amazon 's Prime Instant Video library is n't as extensive as Netflix does n't mean it lacks its own stable of quality content . From original content like Transparent , Alpha House and Mozart in the Jungle to HBO favorites like True Blood and The Wire , and new shows and movies added every month , there are plenty of excellent series to watch after you finish ordering that last-minute birthday gift from Amazon . But before we divulge our favorite new shows and the best new films , let 's talk about what Amazon Prime Instant video is , how to get it and how much it 's going to cost . Amazon , the major online retailer that sells everything under the sun and can ship almost anything in under 24 hours , has two video streaming services , Amazon Instant Video and Prime Instant Video . The former is a video rental and purchasing platform implemented a few years back to sell digital copies of movies and TV shows directly to consumers without the need for physical copies . You 're able to rent content for a few hours for a couple of bucks or , if you 'd rather own it indefinitely , purchase the content outright . The latter , Prime Instant Video , is a bit smaller than Amazon 's digital marketplace , but works like an all-you-can-eat buffet for Amazon Prime subscribers . Essentially , as long as you shell out the $ 99/£79 per year asking price , you 'll get a front-row seat to hundreds of TV shows and movies all without ever worrying about how much it 's going to cost . So how do you start ? Head over to Amazon Prime and sign up for the 30-day free trial to see if the service fits your need . After 30 days , you 'll start an annual subscription at full price . Now , if you 're new to Prime Instant Video , skip down to the `` best shows and movies '' sections found below . If you 're a veteran binge-watcher , however , and are just looking for something new , here 's every new show and movie coming to Amazon this month . Here 's all the shows and movies coming to Amazon Prime Instant Video in the month of July , sorted by chronological order : July 1 July 2 July 3 July 5 July 10 July 11 July 16 July 18 July 23 There 's no shortage of great series on Amazon . There are so many in fact , we 've even written a whole article about it . ( See : The Best Amazon Prime Instant TV series . ) But to save you a few clicks and some precious seconds , here are the top three shows you absolutely need to watch the second you subscribe to Amazon Prime Instant Video . Transparent ( Season 1 ) Transparent is everything you want in a TV show . It 's funny , it 's heartfelt and , most importantly , it tackles an issue that does n't get a lot of attention : transgenderism . As likely to make you cry as it is to make you laugh , this excellent drama follows a divorced man ( played by Jeffrey Tambor ) as he attempts to tell his conceited children about the emotional anguish of feeling like a woman in a man 's body . The Wire ( Seasons 1-5 ) Following the `` infrequently seen , but needs to be discussed '' category is The Wire , a show that premiered on HBO in 2002 that cut its teeth on the topics of race and racism in the eyes of the law . Even though the show 's last credits rolled seven years ago , there 's a level of pertinence that echoes in the Zeitgeist of police shootings that pop-up all-too-often in the news . Alpha House ( Seasons 1-2 ) While we love TV with real purpose , craftsmanship and a philosophical undertone , sometimes it 's nice to sit back , relax and watch John Goodman do a near-perfect interpretation of a Southern congressman dealing with the red-tape and dirty politics on Capitol Hill . Need permission to binge-watch both seasons ? Motion granted . Amazon Instant 's video library is an immense place filled with amazing classic films from the golden days of the silver screen and topped off with a splash of modern-day masterpieces . While there 's not enough time to dive into the deep-end with Amazon 's library , here are three of the best films you can find on Prime Instant Video that you ca n't miss . Blade Runner `` What makes a man human ? '' While Descartes may have summarized it the most eloquently in his five-word declaration `` I think therefore I am , '' it was n't until director Ridley Scott took Philip K. Dick 's `` Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? '' that a work of art so skillfully took a crack at the question . Apocalypse Now A riddle , wrapped up in a mystery , inside an enigma , Apocalypse Now poses questions that have no answers , and while it may come off as a bit heady it absolutely remains one of the best films on war , power and humanity ever made . Annie Hall Sometimes soliloquy has no place in films . It 's pandering . Spoonfeeding . But there are scenes in Annie Hall that Woodie Allen 's soliloquy feels more natural than the already great acting . It adds an extra layer of thought to the deep musings of what it means to fall in and out of love and ultimately makes this a more of a relatable film than a stereotypical romantic comedy could ever hope be . Want even more streaming shows ? Check out our list of the best online video streaming services , Hulu and Hulu Plus : the latest TV shows and movies to stream and list of new shows and movies on Netflix .

Amazon launched new iOS and Android apps to access files stored on its Cloud Drive service , but do n't expect to get too much from the experience . Even though the Cloud Drive apps complement Amazon 's affordable unlimited digital storage , the implementation lacks a post-PC strategy . Unlike competing apps from Google , Microsoft and Dropbox , Amazon 's app is read-only , lacks the ability to automatically sync content from your phone and denies users the ability to manually upload locally stored files on an Android or iPhone . To do any of these tasks , you 'll have to resort to the old-fashioned way – firing up the web browser and accessing Cloud Drive 's web interface . It seems Amazon may have rushed the apps to stake a claim in the competitive cloud market . Even though not everything is `` cloud nine '' with Cloud Drive , there are still things you can do from within the apps . The app will allow you to view documents , files , videos and photos that have already been uploaded . You can use the app to share what 's in your cloud with others . Cloud Drive allows users to send files on the cloud as an email attachment or as a public link . Unfortunately , Amazon does n't allow for private links on Cloud Drive , so business users will likely steer clear of the public link option , especially with sensitive or confidential files . Cloud Drive also allows you to open files with other apps . If you can live with the short list of features that the Cloud Drive mobile apps allow you to perform at this time , then the service 's all-inclusive $ 60 ( £38 , AU $ 80 ) per year unlimited plan is far cheaper than rival services . For users and small businesses with copious digital storage needs , Google 's and Dropbox 's $ 9.99 ( £6 , AU $ 13 ) monthly pricing for 1TB of cloud space can add up quickly . Microsoft makes its OneDrive service free and unlimited to Office 365 subscribers . Photographers who do n't need to store other file types – like Office files or PDFs – can subscribe to a cheaper $ 12 ( £7 , AU $ 16 ) per year plan that includes unlimited photo storage . However , if you 're shooting from your phone , you 'll also need to download the Cloud Drive Photos app to upload from your mobile device . Hopefully , Amazon will build more functionality into the Cloud Drive mobile apps in the future . Competing Google Drive , Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox apps all come with more features , including automatic file uploads and document editing capabilities . `` Amazon tells us it plans to keep the pricing the same as it expands its service to mobile , and it will also continue to invest in both the Cloud Drive and Cloud Drive Photos apps going forward , '' TechCrunch reported . To appeal to enterprise customers , Amazon will need to also beef up Cloud Drive security with features like two-factor authentication . Read our picks for the best cloud storage service

Amazon may have just let slip some details about the new Android Wear Huawei Watch that it probably was n't meant to . In a pre-order listing that 's now been taken down , the page interestingly listed that the Huawei Watch will be `` Compatible with most devices with an iOS 8.2 or Android 4.3 or later operating system . '' It 's something that has been hinted at since last year , but given that Amazon would likely have the correct information about a new product , we 're willing to be that this does pretty much confirm that Android Wear will be compatible with iOS devices in the near future . And it should be a big coup for Android Wear over Apple Watch , as it will open up the rather large iPhone-user market for those who might not want Apple 's smartwatch offering . Amazon did also reveal some other interesting details about the Huawei Watch , as well . The pre-order page listed it to have a 1.4-inch round AMOLED display with 'scratch resistant sapphire glass , as well as over 40 preinstalled watch faces and swappable bands . It also says that Huawei 's smartwatch will begin shipping starting September 2 . Of course , as the listing has now been taken down , the shipping date might change . We 'll be keeping an eye out to see if the page does come back up again .

Major changes are reported afoot in Amazon 's hardware efforts . Several projects are said to be on hold , while the company 's first , failed attempt at breaking into the smartphone market may have been its last . The e-commerce company is in the midst of restructuring its hardware efforts , the Wall Street Journal reports , resulting in the layoff of dozens of engineers from its secretive hardware division , Lab126 , which was responsible for the Fire Phone . News broke in late 2014 that the e-commerce giant was at work on a successor to the Fire Phone . This was surprising not only because the experimental phone reportedly cost Amazon $ 170 million in losses , but also since CEO Jeff Bezos admitted the phone was a failure , albeit a `` smart '' one . Alas , Amazon no longer thought it very smart to push on with the smartphone project . Aside from laying off an undisclosed amount of engineers , the WSJ reports that Amazon is scaling back its hardware efforts . Several projects have been put on hold , including a tablet with a much larger screen , as well as a product that aimed to be a high-end computer for the kitchen ( not quite sure how well that one would have done , anyway ) . The Fire Phone negatively impacted morale in Lab126 , but that 's not to say the hardware development center did n't have its share of successes . Actually , it had quite a few of them , like the Kindle and its many models and tablet variations , as well as the Fire TV set-top box , and more recently , the innovative Amazon Echo and quirky Dash Buttons . It 's highly doubtful that this move will translate into Amazon fully bowing-out of producing hardware . Kindles will continue to be made and , if anything , a re-evaluation might be just what it needs if we 're to see another Fire Phone . But even as much as we would like for Amazon to take another crack at making a smartphone , the smartphone industry , as it stands , is carrying on just fine without it .

Amazon has just announced its new Amazon Underground store which will let you download and install completely free versions of the most popular apps and games . This is n't free as in `` free to download , but pay in-app to unlock the decent stuff '' – Amazon is promising that these will be completely , 100 % free . It looks like some apps that come with in-app purchases will still offer those upgrades , but they could be offered gratis as well . So how come Amazon is able to offer all these apps and games , which include premium titles like OfficeSuite Professional 8 , Goat Simulator and Angry Birds Slingshot Stella ? According to Amazon on the Underground website , it has come to an agreement with app makers where they pay them an amount according to how many minutes you use the apps , and in return the app makers offer their wares to us for free . Due to Google 's rules you ca n't download the free apps from the Google Play Store , and instead you 'll need to download the Underground app directly from Amazon 's website . If you own a Fire HD or Fire HDX tablet , the games and apps will be made automatically available to you . Paid for apps will also being included , so if you want to stick with the freebies you need to keep an eye out for apps and games that are marked with the `` Actually Free '' banner . Amazon has offered apps and games you 'd usually pay to download for free before with its existing app , but it looks like it is now putting an emphasis on the freebies with the new Underground service . The online retailer has also made it clear that this is n't a one-off promotion to get you to install its new app , and rather it is a long term program , promising that `` over time , we 'll continue to invent and add more benefits to Underground '' . At the moment the Underground app , and all it 's freebies , is available only on Android Phones , and there 's no sign if its heading to iOS any time soon .

After two years of owning the market with aging hardware , the Apple TV has finally fallen behind Google , Amazon and Roku as the fourth highest-selling set-top box according to research group Parks Associates . According to the study the group recently conducted , the Apple TV has fallen far behind the market leader , Roku , which currently sits at 34 % of all streaming devices sold in the US . What does that mean for Apple besides a lousy day at the water cooler ( and a 2.5 % drop in shares ) ? It means real financial incentive to make the Apple TV 2 . The study goes on to say that despite not being a bell ringer at the checkout counter , it 's still one of the most used set-top boxes of last year with 17 % of all usage according to the group . Considering that there 's an Apple event happening in early September , however , we might not have to wait long for the Cupertino company 's latest living room device .

Starting August 1 , Amazon has refreshed its Amazon Households settings for Prime members , limiting membership sharing to two adults and up to four children . According to a recent research report , 5 % of all Amazon Prime memberships are shared , and although this does n't seem a lot , it is likely that this percentage may drop even further now . Previously , Amazon Households settings allowed sharing for up two four Prime members , making it easy to share the cost of a yearly Prime membership between friends , as even though the household address needed to be the same , you could technically get around that by adding different shipping addresses . This allowed everyone in the Amazone Households to access all Prime benefits , including free 2-day shipping , access to Instant Prime Video streaming , Kindle Owners ' Lending Library and Prime Early Access . It was made easier because each Amazon account could be linked to different payment options , which were n't necessarily shared . Now , with the new Amazon Households settings , only two adults can share a Prime membership , and `` both adult account holders need to authorize each other to use credit and debit cards associated with their Amazon accounts for purchases on Amazon . '' Your payment options will stay the same , but you will also be able to copy and paste each other 's credit and debit card information to your own account - which might deter non-household membership sharing . If you have children , though , up to four children profiles can be added now , without the need for them to have their own accounts . This definitely gears Amazon Household to a more family-friendly service , at least , as you 'll be able to share digital content with more of your kids through the Family Library option . It does n't seem like these changes are retroactive , and currently only effects new sign ups for Amazon Households . But if you already have a four-adult-member Households set up , it could potentially effect you if you go in to change the sharing setups you currently have . Via Engadget

Update : Amazon has confirmed to us that the Transparent Prime offer is indeed US-only . Perhaps next time the e-tailer wins , there will be a global price slash . Original story below ... Streaming services won big during the Emmy 's and one company wants to give back . On Friday , September 25th starting at 12:01 AM ET , and ending at 11:59 PM PT , Amazon is offering up its Prime services for $ 67 . It 's a limited , one day sale that 's for new customers and will only last the year . The price will resume the $ 99 fee once the year is over . The 67 dollar price point is in reference to Amazon 's five wins at the 67th Emmy 's Awards show . The online e-tailer is likely trying to garner even more attention for its Prime Instant Video Service where original Amazon show Transparent won several awards . You 'll also get access to the Kindle Owner 's Lending Library ( if you have a Kindle ) , Prime Photos through Amazon Cloud Drive and of course , the two-day shipping . It 's unclear if the offer is US-only though we 've reached to Amazon and will update once we hear back .
Coming in hot off the success of its first Emmy award wins with Transparent , Amazon has announced its next bundle of pilots . Just like in years past , viewers with Amazon Prime have the voting power to decide which shows get greenlit , and conversely , the shows that do n't make it past the pilot . This season 's offering brings six pilots of incredible diversity to the table . First off , Edge : The Loner is a western-themed pilot based on George G. Gilman 's book series . It has the reputation of being `` the most violent western in print '' , so tune into this one if you enjoy gritty action . Good Girls Revolt has its focus set on the newsroom in the late 1960s , one of the last occupations in the workforce to be reserved exclusively for men . The pilot follows a group of young female researches fighting for gender equality in the workplace and a change in the way an industry operates from the inside-out . Next up is Highston . It 's a pilot about a 19-year old who has a group of celebrity friends . That might sound pretty unremarkable , except for the fact that all of these friends are imaginary . Check this out if you 're into comedy that involves a central character living in a world that 's ( likely ) much stranger than your own . One Mississippi is a dark comedy with none other than Louis CK onboard as executive producer . The pilot is loosely inspired by Tig Notaro 's life , a stand-up comedian who has overcome some serious odds , ones that many of us can relate to . Patriot is a political thriller centered around an intelligence officer who has to assume a new life in order to prevent Iran from going nuclear . Fans of Homeland and House of Cards will probably want to check this one out . Lastly , Z is a bio-series based on the life of Zelda Fitzgerald . Of course , meeting and marrying American literature great F. Scott Fitzgerald is a central part of the story , but there 's much more to it than that . As someone who has only heard of Zelda through F. Scott 's lens , I 'm intrigued to check this one out . Christina Ricci from Monster and Addam 's Family stars as Zelda . Amazon is burning rubber to catch up to Netflix 's successful lineup of shows . Will this batch of pilots be up there in both quality and staying-power to rival that of House of Cards , or new favorite , Narcos ? Check them out , vote , then let us know which ones you liked .

If you 're forced to choose between those precious moments of extra sleep and reading the headlines in the morning , the latest update for the Amazon Echo speaker might have the solution . The update has added Trove to the speaker , an option that enables you to ask for the top news headlines on any given subject . If any of the headlines happen to pique your interest you 'll still have to look elsewhere for more details , but Trove could prove to be an efficient way to catch up on the news of the day while you 're , say , in the shower . The update also fine-tunes Echo 's alarms and timers , adding the ability to ask when specific timers run out , and cancel alerts when the weekend arrives .

It 's been an interesting week . In the UK new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn crowdsourced his questions for Prime Minister 's Question Time . In the US a 14-year-old boy was arrested for making a digital clock , and then invited to the White House by President Obama . And in Cupertino , a bug so devastating it ca n't be allowed to escape means the watchOS 2 update did n't happen as planned . It 's an OS-updating , Fido-feeding , Ford-finding Week in Tech ! Fancy a better battery , a faster phone and sleeker , more beautiful hair ? iOS 9 can help with at least two of these things . The update is out now and as Matt Swider says in his in-depth iOS 9 review , it 's much better than its predecessor . Only Apple Maps prevents it from being `` the perfect update '' : it 's got better Siri , a better keyboard , iPad multitasking and it 's compatible with devices going back to the iPhone 4S . Once you 've got it , check out our 50 killer tips for iOS 9 . There are lots of new goodies for you to try . There 's a new version of the Apple Watch OS too – watchOS 2 – but sadly you ca n't download that just yet : its release has been pulled at the last minute due to an enormous but unspecified bug . Are you wearing the future of Fords on your wrist ? If you 've got an Apple Watch or Android Wear device and a Ford electric or plug-in hybrid , you might be . Ford has updated its MyFord Mobile app for both iOS and Android to bring a whole range of features to your wrist . You can manage the climate control , lock and unlock the car , check its charge status , and even get directions to where you 've parked . For now it 's limited to the C-Max Energi , Focus Electric and Fusion Energi , but Ford 's keen to bring it to more vehicles in the not too distant future . Uber , the infamous ride-sharing firm that 's not entirely popular among taxi drivers , has a bright idea : self-driving cars doing absolutely everything . Our in-depth look at the technology behind the startup is fascinating enough , but what 's really interesting about Uber is the ambition it 's bringing to that technology : its goal is `` to provide transportation for everyone and everything everywhere '' – not just people , but groceries and packages too . It thinks driverless cars will be key to that , and while it 's not saying when it expects to transition to self-driving vehicles , it 's clear that for Uber it 's a case of when , not if . The article 's fascinating and a little bit frightening too . Bad news ! Project Morpheus is no more ! Good news ! It 's been renamed , not killed ! The VR system known as Project Morpheus is now the much duller-sounding PlayStation VR . Thrilling it ai n't , but it 's probably easier to sell . Sony announced the change at this year 's Tokyo Game Show alongside a Bloodborne expansion , Everybody 's Golf for the PS4 and another Assassin 's Creed : Syndicate trailer . We 've rounded up the most interesting TGS announcements right here . Bad news for Snapchat replay fans : replays on Android now cost real cash money if you want to see more than one per day . James Peckham says that 's a sign that Snapchat has no idea how to grow : `` Flailing its arms in the air , the company has now decided to charge users for one of the apps most limited features , '' he says . `` Even sticking in a quick advert for a film inside my Snapchat window would be better than charging ridiculous money for a feature that should come free . '' Facebook is working on a dislike button that means you 'll be able to share sadness as well as happiness . As Cameron Faulkner says , `` Basically , Facebook does n't want you to troll people with the new dislike button , but to rather use it to 'express empathy , ' as Zuckerberg stated . I feel like I know how this will pan out already . '' The button has n't even been launched yet but Matt Swider is already hammering it . `` Facebook is playing right into the hands of this snarkiest generation in history , motivating 20 and 30-year-old millennials to downvote posts without ever reading beyond the headline… it spurs a new form of laziness . It 's a shallow way to show feeling without ever expressing true empathy . '' In Silicon Valley 's ongoing quest to automate everything its parents used to do , Amazon has given petcare firm Petnet a big pile of cash to create products that integrate with Amazon 's Echo home hub to feed pets . Petnet 's first device is the SmartFeeder , which uses an app to track feeding frequency and how much food is left inside and remind the owner to feed Fido . To think , in the olden days people had to check bowls and remember to put dog food in them . The horror ! Amazon also announced a brand new Fire TV box - one that supports 4K streaming . The new box will be rolling out on October 5 and brings a faster processor and improved controller with it . There 's also a new Fire TV Stick , but this one is just getting voice commands and wo n't be getting the same resolution upgrade . Finally , the company announced a new 7-inch Fire tablet that costs an incredibly low £50/ $ 50 . However , to subsidise the price , Amazon will give you adverts on the lock screen - unless you pay a little more to get the tablet without them .

That 's not a typo , Amazon 's latest Fire 7 tablet will set you back just $ 49.99 . For that more than manageable outlay you 're treated to a 7-inch 1020 x 600 display , 1.3GHz quad-core processor , 1GB of RAM , VGA front and 2MP rear cameras , and a microSD port . Amazon claims the battery is good for up to seven hours , including reading , movies and games . It also reckons its new Fire 7 slate is twice as durable as the iPad Air 2 . It runs Amazon 's own , heavily modified version of Android - dubbed Fire OS - and all three new Fire tablets are running the latest version , Fire OS 5 `` Bellini '' . This gives you a very different look and feel on screen , with Amazon 's own services thrust to the front of the queue . The specs are far from the best on the market , but at this price point the new Fire 7 could still be quite a steal . As their names suggest the new Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 tablets sport high definition display and equally attractive starting price tags at $ 149.99 ( for 8GB of storage ) and $ 229.99 ( for 16GB of storage ) respectively . A 1.5GHz quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM sit at the heart of both slates , plus each feature a 1280 x 800 resolution , 5MP rear camera , HD front snapper and microSD slot . The resolution does n't sound brilliant for either tablet , and could be a sign of how Amazon has kept its costs down . The 8-inch variant coming in black , magenta , blue , and tangerine , while its larger 10-inch counterpart only offers black and white . All three tablets will start shipping on September 30 , with pre-orders open now .
Amazon is taking another swing at the living room , introducing a brand new Fire TV box that adds 4K streaming . It 's also announced a new Fire TV Stick that supports voice commands . The new Fire TV looks just like its predecessor ( and the stick does too , in fact ) , but Amazon has packed in some new hardware including a faster processor – 75 % faster , it claims – all of which should give Apple reason to be concerned . Of course , you 'll need a 4K TV if you want to enjoy 4K movies or TV shows , along with a broadband speed of 15Mbps or higher . The good news is that with both Netflix and Amazon Prime Video on the box , you 'll have access to a fair bit of 4K content out of the gate . As well as the 8GB of onboard storage , the Fire TV now offers expandable storage via microSD card slot , enabling you boost it up to 128GB . The controller has also been given some improvements which will enable it to last longer on two AAA batteries ; it 's also a tad faster . There 's a new game controller too , which now works over Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth for better latency , and includes a built-in mic for voice controls . As for the TV Stick , beyond voice commands it 's the same affair – you wo n't be getting a 4K upgrade here – but it will cost just £45/ $ 50 . As for the Fire TV , that 's going to set you back £80/ $ 99 , which is a good price for access to 4K content . Both are available to pre-order today , with the Fire TV shipping on October 5 and the Stick rolling out on October 22 .

The next step for the Amazon Echo on its path to becoming the center of your smarthome might not be the place you 'd expect : your dog 's food dish . Amazon announced today that Petnet , an internet of things pet care company , is the latest project to receive funding from the Alexa Fund - Amazon 's developer-facing investment firm . The funding will go towards creating products that integrate with the Echo , including smart food dishes that `` keeps owners informed of proper feeding portions and delivers insights to them about compatible ingredients specific to their pet 's age , weight and level of activity . '' The device Petnet currently makes is called the SmartFeeder , which until now used an app to track meal frequency and food levels inside the device . The only example command listed by the company so far is , `` Alexa , how much has Max eaten today ? `` , though it does n't appear to be out of the question that you 'd be able to ask how much food is left in the feeder and when the last time 'Max ' has eaten . While it 's still early in development , the idea sounds cool for pet owners looking for stats on their furry friends . Petnet joins nine previously funded companies - Musaic , Rachio , Orange Chef , Scout Alarm , Garageio , Toymail , Dragon Innovation , MARA , and Mojio - alongside other IoT devices like the Philips Hue lightbulbs and Samsung Smart Hub to get Echo support .
After hearing word of a new , super cheap Amazon Kindle Fire tablet , it seems the world 's online flea market will have a few more models in store for us . An AFTVnews reader recently discovered thumbnail images of four new tablets hosted on Amazon 's server . On top of a six image , it seems Amazon also has plans to announce slates with a spectrum of screen sizes including seven to eight , eight to nine and a 10-inch device to likely rival the iPad Air 2 and Nexus 9 . Unlike the rumored 6.7-inch Kindle Fire , which was first revealed in a set of leaked Geekbench 3 benchmarks , it appears Amazon 's other tablets will stick to the 16:10 screen resolution seen on earlier devices . But before you put too much faith in these supposed official images , they 're all incredibly tiny and low-resolution . This significantly lowers the validity of these rumors as there 's not enough detail to tell if these are indeed part of Amazon 's new slate family . That said , EV Leaks was able to dig up a much higher-resolution image of the rumored 10.1-inch Kindle Fire . Assuming the images are authentic , the 10.1-inch Kindle looks like a blown up Kindle Fire Phone with a flatter back compared to the beveled sides of Amazon 's more recent HDX Kindle Fire refresh . What 's more , it appears Amazon has instituted a new user interface that drops the bookshelf approach for a more traditional set of Android app tiles . At the rate these leaks are going , it seems like Amazon could announce its new tablets any day not even though the web-retailer has yet to announce an official reveal event .

Blue Origin , the private space travel startup owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , has announced plans to build and launch rockets to orbit from Cape Canaveral , Florida . The company has been working on an experimental suborbital spacecraft , called New Shepherd , that can be saved and used numerous times with hopes of developing commercial space travel . And according to Bezos , you wo n't have to wait to long for a possible trip to space , as Blue Origin plans on `` launching from here [ Florida ] later this decade . '' Specifically , Blue Origin will operate out of Launch Complex 36 , a spaceport that used to launch rockets for NASA and the United States Air Force . `` The site saw its last launch in 2005 and the pad has stood silent for more than 10 years - too long , '' Bezos said . `` We ca n't wait to fix that . '' Blue Origin will also build a `` 21st century production facility '' near the Kennedy Space Center at Exploration Park in Florida , which will focus on the manufacturing of a `` reusable fleet of orbital launchers and readying them for flight again and again '' . Bezos said that a new orbital rocket using the company 's new BE-4 engine will be built at this facility . The company has already tested its suborbital New Shepherd rocket , and though that test did n't end in success , after more testing , it should be able to fly three people or a mix of passengers and payloads into suborbital space . If you 're interested in finding out how you can get tickets for a Blue Origin flight up to space , you can sign up for more info through the company 's website .

Amazon 's Fire Phone is dead , so the company has decided to go back to what it does… well , okay at . That 's making tablets , and Amazon 's new one is set to be super cheap . It 's set to compete in the area currently owned by the Tesco Hudl 2 , offering some impressive spec under the £100 mark . The latest rumours suggest the new tablet will be cheaper than a normal Kindle at $ 50 ( about £32 , AU $ 70 ) and given that price it 's got quite an impressive spec . A GeekBench 3 listing shows it with a 6.7-inch 1024 x 600 display , a quad-core MediaTek processor and 1GB of RAM . There 's also a 2MP camera on the back and a 0.3MP front one as well . There 's no word on 802.11n Wi-Fi or Bluetooth 4.0 . On top of that there will be 8GB of internal storage – a let-down for a tablet , and there 's no microSD card slot , so do n't expect to have much space after Amazon 's software is loaded on . Then again , you get what you pay for , so we ca n't be too disappointed if the tablet really is that cheap . Via WinFuture

Amazon 's Fire Phone is out of stock right now and it looks like the company is n't planning to restock it . Amazon 's store currently states the phone is `` currently unavailable '' along with a separate message stating , `` we do n't know when or if this item will be back in stock . '' When asked whether the phone would be returning to the store , an Amazon spokesperson told techradar , `` We have sold through our Fire Phone inventory . '' It 's quite clear Amazon is n't set to restock the Fire Phone anytime soon , but it seems it does n't want to explicitly declare the project dead just yet . Does that mean we may see a return to the Amazon Fire Phone brand in the future ? Probably not . The Wall Street Journal has reported the company laying off `` dozens '' of people who worked on the Fire Phone . The current rumour is that Amazon was once working on a follow-up device , but has now put the project on indefinite hold .

A new report suggests that Amazon may launch a new 6-inch tablet with a super low price tag of only $ 50 . The Wall Street Journal is reporting the super-cheap tablet will be released before the end of the year , according to `` people familiar with the matter '' , and will be launched alongside 8- and 10-inch variations . The sources told the publication that the specs and features will take a hit due to the low cost , adding that it will likely only have mono speakers instead of stereo , but not much else was revealed . With a $ 50 price tag , the new tablet will be the cheapest in Amazon 's current line up , costing about half the price of the 6-inch Fire HD and even less than the cheapest Kindle , which costs $ 79 . We 're not really sure what to expect in a $ 50 tablet , but with the new Kindle Voyager and updated Kindle Paperwhite already out this year , we assume it likely wo n't be another e-reader . Still , it 's also currently unclear if the slates mentioned will be updated versions of Amazon 's Fire HD tablets , but Amazon is expected to announce updated Fire HD tablets sometime later this year . We 'll be reaching out to Amazon for more information , but we 'll likely have to wait until it makes its announcement before we know more .

We stepped away from the IFA show today to sit down with Neil Hunt , Chief Product Officer at Netflix . With all the TV manufacturers rocking new HDR TVs talk inevitably turned to Netflix 's plans for high dynamic range ( HDR ) and when we could expect to see the video streaming giant making the move to HDR content . `` We 're working with the UHD Alliance to set and finalise the standards for HDR delivery , '' said Hunt . `` That work 's not finished yet , we expect to see that deliver some results at the end of this year , the beginning of next year . '' Netflix is determined to offer a 'meaningfully better ' experience than standard dynamic range ( SDR ) and not just on a few high-end screens . `` There 's a lot of screen technology to be developed , '' says Hunt . `` I think at the high-end you see the opportunity to build screens with maybe 1,000Nits or more of brightness and that really makes a compelling HDR experience . And at the lower-end there 's people thinking about 500Nits or so . We 're looking to provide a HDR experience that works across a range of devices . '' When asked if Amazon had jumped the gun by providing HDR content on its Amazon Prime Instant Video service , without waiting for the standards to be finalised , Hunt understandably wanted to concentrate on what Netflix was doing . `` To rephrase our favourite politician ... '' said Hunt with a smile , `` you might very well think that , but I could n't possibly confirm nor deny . Whatever Amazon does or does n't do , I want to focus on what we 're going to do , which is deliver a great HDR experience when the technology and pieces come together . '' Netflix is going to prioritise HDR over Ultra HD when it comes to its adaptive streaming tech . `` I think it 's a bigger visual improvement than it is for 4K over HD , and I think that 's going to be more important to consumers . Furthermore we can deliver HDR at 2K as well as HDR at 4K , and that will work really nicely on a 10mb connection . '' With HDR adding an estimated 20 % extra on top of the bandwidth requirements for streamed video that 's going to push the connection needs up for the top-tier of Netflix 's stream . But if your HDR-compatible 4K TV is n't being delivered the bandwidth necessary for both 4K and HDR Netflix would rather drop down to a lower resolution but retain the HDR picture data . `` If you 've got 10 or 12mb you 're not going to get a 4K stream , '' said Hunt , `` but you could get a 2K HDR stream . '' Another feature of Netflix 's adaptive streaming tech , which will see the light of day sooner than HDR will , is a new streaming resolution standard . Netflix currently steps up its stream from SD to 720p to 1080p and then jumps straight up to Ultra HD . There is then a big resolution gap between 1080p and UHD and it is looking to bridge that gap with a move to 2.5K , or a 2560 x 1440 encode . `` The best approach is to space the encodes by what the industry calls one JND , one just noticeable difference , '' explains Hunt . `` The JND is not typically the quadrupling of pixels you get between SD and HD , nor is it the quadrupling between HD and 4K . So you really need one intermediate step in between a resolution . '' The 2560 x 1440 resolution is that intermediate step offering a tangibly better image than 1080p , but without the punishing bandwidth limitations of Ultra HD . And when the HDR carousel swings around next year that intermediate step will also come with that higher dynamic range . That image quality upgrade is not far away either . `` We 're starting to encode for that intermediate step and you 'll see that in the next few months , '' said Hunt .

Amazon really wants you to start using its Dash Buttons , the company 's small , wirelessly connected button that allows you to order a specific product from Amazon with a single button press . A new promotion is giving US Prime subscribers their first button for free - or more specifically , Amazon will credit back the cost of a Dash Button ( $ 4.99 ) after a Prime member purchases a button . Of course , every other button you purchase will still cost $ 4.99 each and it is still currently only available to Amazon Prime subscribers . Amazon has also added another 11 Dash Button brands , including Orbit Gum , Hefty trash and storage bags , Ziploc and Dixie tableware products . This brings the total number of Dash Button brands up to 29 , and according to Amazon , you could connect your button , which can only order one product , to more than 500 products . It 'll be interesting to see if this promotion will bring more Dash Buttons into homes across the US , but it looks like Amazon 's tech is getting support from more brands at least .
Opinion by techradar Global Editor-in-Chief Patrick Goss Unless you are a Prime subscriber or a TV junkie , the news that Amazon will be offering offline viewing for iOS and Android might well have passed you by . My esteemed colleague Nick Pino believes that Amazon 's shiny new offline streaming service is not really that big a deal as it faces off against Netflix , insisting quite rightly that , without a big library of the latest movies and stellar TV shows the whole feature is relatively redundant . However , there are two facets to the story that turn this new feature into a much bigger deal - what it means for the industry , and what it means for Prime going forward . Let 's start with the latter , which is a much more straightforward case to make . Amazon is , by a huge margin , playing catchup with Netflix in the video streaming world , and it 's all too easy to disregard its audience in comparison with the industry juggernaut . But that fails to acknowledge something fairly obvious - that Amazon is the 500-pound gorilla in multiple other areas - not least the selling of digital media in books and , of course , hard copies of movies in DVD and Blu-ray . That allows it to invest huge sums in bringing cool content to Prime , as well as develop its own original programming . It also gives it a powerful voice with the studios who already rely on Amazon to sell their wares . Amazon has proven to be no slouch in the production of its own content either : Transparent won it a Golden Globe , Bosch picked up critical acclaim and the pilot for The Man in the High Castle has made it one of the most eagerly anticipated TV series of the season . Amazon is big enough and rich enough to produce and buy in wonderful TV and films - and that is going to encourage more people into a Prime subscription . It can also offer up other bonuses that are beyond Netflix - the obvious free delivery , the acorn of Amazon Music and the currently slightly disappointing Prime offers that were pushed out last month . That suggests that Amazon will either close the gap or , at the very least , grow enough to start making serious money from Prime Video , and that 's where offline becomes a significant USP over Netflix going forward . Netflix 's insistence that Wi-Fi everywhere makes offline viewing redundant is , currently , just wrong . For any commuter , frequent flyer or even those that care about quality , a good enough connection can not be guaranteed and watching pixellated noise or just not being able to access content we 've actively paid for is , frankly , irritating . If Netflix do not offer offline caching they will begin to see people migrate to a service that does . And bear in mind that Amazon is not the first streaming service to offer this , with the UK 's Sky Go Extra service already proving popular . And that brings us to the second reason that Amazon 's announcement is significant ; the TV and movie industry is clearly softening its stance on licensing its content for offline caching as it comes to understand the needs of the public . Previously , licensing content has been the biggest barrier to offline - bigger than the technical challenges or resistance of companies to shift their models . The fear of piracy and the need for devices to stop simple sharing has been central to big names ' reticence to allow content from streaming giants to be cached in device memory . European giant Sky has clearly benefited from negotiating its way through this minefield for a couple of years now , but when a global player of the size of Amazon adds offline to its feature set you know that the industry has finally grown to embrace this brave new world . Netflix might well stick to its guns , and Amazon might just find that it Prime Video is not going to become market leader - but the principle of making content available offline from subscription services is here to stay , and that 's good news for us all .

Amazon announced Tuesday that it would offer its Prime members a way to download movies and TV shows to iOS and Android devices for offline viewing , making the service the first and only streaming portal to offer free downloads to its users . While it 's easy to write this off as a small blow in a much larger arms race , the addition of downloadable content is a win for both consumers and Amazon . The etailer 's video content service has stayed in a steady second place behind Netflix for the past few years , and clearly it needed to do something to break out . Necessity is the mother of all innovation ( to paraphrase the old proverb ) , and innovation is what Amazon desperately needs to close the gap between itself and Netflix . But is this move enough to overtake the streaming behemoth that is Netflix ? Does Netflix need to respond in kind ? To answer those questions , we first have to look back at the storied clash between these two media titans . In truth , Amazon has always played second fiddle to Netflix . What 's interesting , however , is that Netflix was n't the first of the two services . While Netflix was still wrapped up in the world of shipping physical media , Amazon launched an unassuming project called Amazon Unbox on September 7 , 2006 as a platform to distribute digital content . It would take five years before the service started to look like what we 're familiar with today ( the service was rebranded to Amazon Prime Instant Video on February 22 , 2011 ) , but by virtue of being first , Amazon had a head start on what would become its biggest competitor . Unfortunately for Amazon , it 's not who can launch first but who can do it better . When Netflix did eventually shift from DVDs to digital content in 2007 , it did so with reckless abandon . It charged a paltry sum for access to the still-growing library of movies and TV shows . When Netflix started to explode around 2013 thanks to shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black , Amazon had a hard time keeping pace . Netflix now has 62 million paid subscribers , around double the amount of active Amazon Prime Instant Video users and about 20 million more members than Amazon Prime as a whole , according to USA Today . That leads us to today 's announcement . By allowing users to download and keep content for free on their mobile devices , Amazon has once again done something before Netflix . This means Amazon will have to fight tooth and nail with movie studios and TV networks to secure downloading rights to movies and TV shows and might not have many wins in the beginning . This opens the door for an even more consumer-friendly environment , and for us , that 's great . But what , if anything , does it mean for the larger battle that Amazon is fighting ? Unfortunately for Amazon , it likely means nothing for now . One trump card , no matter how much attention it gets today , ca n't win a whole war . And because the disparity in number of users is so great between the services , there 's little reason for Netflix to risk potential partnerships over downloading rights . That 's not to say Netflix wo n't eventually offer a comparable service . If Amazon 's ploy proves successful in retaining users and gaining new ones , then Netflix will likely find a way respond with some free download option . But its content distribution formula has worked , and there 's no reason , not yet anyway , for Netflix to mess with it . And not to disparage Amazon 's accomplishment , but does n't the service have larger issues it should be addressing ? Like providing more relevant content instead of relying on HBO shows from the early aughts as its only source of must-watch television . How about being the first service to stream new episodes of Fear the Walking Dead or locking down deals with FX for exclusive streaming rights to Archer ? Amazon has made headway in creating quality original programming , but only a small minority of its shows have captured the public 's attention as much as Netflix . I guess the comparison I 'm struggling to draw here is that Amazon is indeed a power player in the world of streaming , but instead of improving on its core infrastructure by adding TV shows and movies that people care about and cause them to stick around , it 's trying to develop the figurative equivalent of the atom bomb . At the end of the day who cares if we can download content if all the content available is n't worth watching ?
Amazon Prime has been getting better and better for TV and film lovers as it takes on the ever-growing list of streaming rivals , but the service just stuck the knife into Netflix in a big way with a massive new feature - offline viewing . That means you can store video locally on your device and watch ( in a time-limited window ) even when you do n't have a connection - and given that Prime Video has only worked with a Wi-Fi connection previously , that 's a big deal indeed . Plus , offline viewing ( often called offline caching ) is something that the service 's biggest rival , Netflix , does n't offer . We 've spent some time with offline viewing and pulled together a straightforward `` how to '' as well as some of our initial thoughts . We went for the iOS version - although it is available for Android as well . The update is relatively small , and once it 's installed you 'll get a different option screen when looking at an Amazon Prime Show . When your programme is cached and available online it becomes a tick And when you select play you 'll get a warning about the time you get to watch the programme : For this one , the windows was 30 days ... The film library is also available for offline viewing - most of the library seems to be available right now . It 's all as intuitive as you 'd expect , and the service itself is clearly a massive boon for the entire service . For those travelling , this functionality is a game-changer , converting an Amazon subscription from a relatively static offering - best taken advantage of at home - to a genuinely useful service .
Up to now Amazon Prime Instant Video has been a pretty decent subscription streaming service , but most definitely behind rival , Netflix . That could be set to change though as Amazon has just announced its new , free download feature . This might be a real game-changer in the streaming wars . From today , Amazon Prime subscribers will be able to download TV shows and movies to their iOS or Android devices and watch them even without an internet connection . That makes Amazon Prime the first subscription video service to offer the ability to download directly to a device for watching later . Amazon Prime really is becoming a stupidly good-value subscription ... Not all of Amazon Prime 's video content is available for download though , but Amazon Originals , like Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle , will be . As will Amazon streaming exclusives , The Walking Dead and Vikings . You can check out the list of downloadable goodies here . `` We are proud to be the first and only online subscription streaming service that enables offline viewing , '' said Jay Marine , Vice President of Digital Video at Amazon EU , `` on holiday , in a car , at the beach , on a plane , wherever our Prime members want to watch they can , regardless of internet connection . '' As part of this latest upgrade Amazon has updated its iOS and Android apps , with the Android version now being a dedicated video application . It 's a bit of a shame Amazon has missed the Summer holiday period , but the new feature finally makes the Prime Instant Video service really stand out against the likes of Netflix , Hulu and HBO Go .

Small business owners looking to entice new customers through deals and discounts will soon have one less option to market themselves . Amazon announced that it will shutter its Amazon Local service starting December 18 . The move is unsurprising given that Amazon Local competitors have not fared well . Groupon announced it would lay off 1,100 employees last month and LivingSocial announced this month that it is trimming its workforce by 20 % as it moves away from deals . `` From October 30 , 2015 until December 18 , 2015 , you can continue to purchase deals at Amazon Local as usual , '' Amazon announced on its website . `` All purchased vouchers will not be affected by this change and remain valid according to their terms . '' As deal hosting companies like Amazon Local , LivingSocial and Groupon change their business models , small businesses will also have to evolve the way they market to consumers . LivingSocial , for example , is changing its focus to delivering experiences to customers . `` We 've learned a great deal from the daily deals business and will look for ways to apply these lessons in the future as we continue to innovate on behalf of our customers and merchants , '' an Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch . Amazon 's new direction with local commerce seems to be around partnering with local merchants rather than highlighting individual businesses . For example , Amazon Home Services allows customers to choose and hire a local repairman that 's part of the Amazon network , and Amazon is working with local restaurants for food delivery through Amazon Prime Now . Amazon is also working on expanding the availability of its same-day Amazon Prime delivery service , which means the company will be competing more directly against local merchants . If you 're a business that sells goods on Amazon , the e-commerce giant still offers platform-wide deals through its Deal of the Day and Gold Box Deals . There are still opportunities for small businesses to promote , but new business models from Amazon and LivingSocial may be less centered on discounts , and more about quality service , like a local pizzeria offering fast delivery through the Amazon Prime Now network .
Ever wondered what Jeremy Clarkson has been doing since his rather dramatic departure from the BBC ? Here at techradar towers we thought he would be swimming in the vat of cash Amazon offered him for starring in a new car-related show . But it turns out he 's been watching shows on an Amazon TV Fire TV Stick , while gently mocking the Beeb . Yeah , right . In a new advert , a contractually obliged Clarkson roams his home on a Segway then sits to watch something on the Fire TV Stick , quickly skipping past the BBC iPlayer app to the Amazon Prime channel . Some say this advert is an allegory for the state of TV at the moment , and that Clarkson and his cohorts have done the right thing disbanding from the BBC and getting into streaming . One look at Clarkson 's eyes , though , and they seem to be telling a very different story ...

Facebook has the Oculus Rift , Microsoft has the HoloLens , and Google still has Google Glass ( just about ) - most of the big names in technology are working on an augmented or virtual reality headset of some kind , and it looks like Amazon wants in on the action too . A filing just published by the US Patent and Trademark Office shows Jeff Bezos and his team are at least thinking about it : the patent application shows a pair of smart glasses that could potentially display video in front of the eyes of the wearer ( no doubt Amazon Prime Video , of course ) . The main benefit of augmented reality over virtual reality is that you can quickly switch back to seeing the real world , or combine overlaid graphics with what 's actually happening in front of you . That appears to be Amazon 's thinking , though it 's worth noting that the patent was originally submitted two years ago . One of the example scenarios mentioned in Amazon 's documentation is using the glasses to watch movies on a plane . AR technology is able to create a much more immersive experience than a smartphone or tablet , so you can more easily forget that you 're sat inside a cramped metal tube . It 's a difficult technology to master though , and Amazon is going to need to invest some serious engineering time and effort to make this a reality . The company has n't officially responded to a request for comment . Applying for a patent is one thing , but actually bringing something to market is another - as Amazon knows from the Fire Phone , making a hardware product that people will actually go out and buy is never straightforward . If Amazon 's AR specs do eventually show up , however , you heard it here first . Via Re/code

Amazon is reportedly looking into creating a live online TV service , one that would rival cable companies , similar services , and beat Apple 's own rumored TV streaming service to the punch . The etailer , which has an on-demand video service , is said to have reached out to big-time TV players like CBS and NBCUniversal about providing the companies ' content on its service , according to Bloomberg . Amazon is still exploring the option , so there 's a chance it may not go through with the service . Still , it 's an intriguing possibility . Not only would it add another offering to Amazon 's already boisterous product and services arsenal , it could potentially arrive before Apple has a chance to launch its own service . It 's been rumored the Cupertino firm has a live TV streaming service in the works , but its iPhone 6S launch event came and went with only a new Apple TV announced on the home entertainment front . Amazon recently agreed to buy Elemental Technologies , a high-speed video encoding and transcoding software firm , which one analyst said gives the company the platform to transmit live TV online .

It 's official : Amazon will stop selling Apple TV and Google Chromecast this month . Amazon wo n't allow new listings for the rival streaming products to go up and will take down listings for current inventory by October 29 , as outlined in an email Amazon sent to marketplace sellers and obtained by Bloomberg Business . Amazon sells Apple TV and the first Chromecast ( Google announced Chromecast 2 on Tuesday ) , but it cites concerns about Prime Video on the devices as the reason for removing them from its online storefront . Over the last three years , Prime Video has become an important part of Prime , '' an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement . `` It 's important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion . Roku , Xbox , PlayStation and Fire TV are excellent choices . '' As you can surmise , Amazon will continue to sell Roku , Xbox , PlayStation and its own Fire TV as these products work well enough with Prime Video . The Amazon Fire TV Stick is sticking around , too . It 's important to note that Apple TV users ca n't directly watch Amazon Prime Video movies or shows from the service ( they can stream them from their iPhone or iPad via AirPlay ) . And Chromecast owners only have access to the Prime Instant Video app . Still , to completely stop selling the popular devices because one streaming service ( owned and operated by Amazon ) is n't natively supported on them seems like thin reasoning to push out the competing products . Google , for one , created a Chromecast SDK so that developers could make their apps compatible with the streaming stick , and it 's open to Amazon . We 've asked Amazon whether it 's worked on making Prime Video available on Chromecast using the SDK , and will update this story when we hear back .

Call my a cynic , but I do n't think it 's a coincidence that the last three Cyber Mondays have been pre-empted with Amazon announcing some new headline-grabbing tech project . In 2013 , it revealed that its R & D department was working on drones capable of delivering packages within 30 minutes ; in 2014 it was warehouse robots ; this year , it 's drones again ! And no , the irony of writing this story does not escape us . The new drone that Amazon 's showing off still aims for 30-minute deliveries , but now comes with a brand new design and is capable of flying up to 15 miles , reaching altitudes of 400 feet . The latest prototype takes the shape of a small plane which can take off vertically before switching to horizontal flight . It then switches back to vertical mode to drop off your package , before zipping off again for its next adventure . The video , which features new Amazon golden boy Jeremy Clarkson , gives us a glimpse into a future where nobody bats an eyelid at the thought of calling in a drone to deliver an emergency pair of shoes . `` In time there 'll be a whole family of Amazon drones . Different designs for different environments , '' Clarkson tells us , suggesting that the previous design might still be in development alongside this one . But still hovering above is the uncertainty of the law . The FAA ( Federal Aviation Administration ) is still deciding on the rules over in the US , while the UK laws have been more lenient . Earlier this year the FAA proposed rules to allow drone deliveries so long as certain weight and visibility restrictions were met , but the final guidelines are yet to be revealed .

Making rockets is a playground for the billionaires right now , and it turns out that yesterday Amazon 's CEO Jeff Bezos beat PayPal founder Elon Musk to a rather significant rocketry first . Bezos 's Blue Origin is less known than Musk 's SpaceX , yet it was Blue Origin that has now managed to successfully land a BE-3 rocket smoothly on the ground first . This is a significant achievement as it paves the way for reusable rockets in the future - which will be an important step towards making space travel affordable . Perched atop the BE-3 is the New Shepard capsule where in the future astronauts and cargo will sit . As this was just a test launch though , the capsule came back to earth and landed safely with parachutes . The BE-3 fell back to Earth with its engines firing when it was 5000 feet above ground . It was then able to make a controlled landing at a gentle 4.4mph . Amazingly it managed to land only 4.5 feet off of the original launch pad . Prior to this launch SpaceX had been trying to achieve similar , carrying out two higher profile launches of its own Falcon rockets and attempting to land them a floating barge platform . But while it came close both times , the rockets still ended up crashing . Elon Musk has yet to react to his rival 's success on Twitter - though we 're guessing that he might be thinking twice about renewing his Amazon Prime subscription . You can watch the landing in the video below which the company has produced showcasing the achievement . Via Engadget

If we ever think about the environmental impact of our upgrade addiction , it 's usually to berate ourselves for the damage it does . But there is an option for your old mobile that will not only reduce waste , but actively help to preserve some of the most threatened habitats in the world . In the last 50 years , 17 % of the Amazon rainforest has been destroyed – partly by climate change , but much of it through illegal logging to develop farmland . This is a terrible loss by itself , but it also deprives indigenous tribes of their homes and drives rare species of plants and animals to extinction . There are even wider-reaching effects too : because forests act as a carbon sink , the more we lose , the more CO2 is released into the atmosphere and the greater the potential for global warming . But there is a way to protect the rainforests , and your old phone could be part of it , thanks to the charity Rainforest Connection . We spoke to CEO Topher White about how your discarded handset could help to save the world . Loggers can often be stopped just by warning them off , but the small number of people trying to catch them ca n't be everywhere at once , especially in an area as vast as the Amazon . That 's where Rainforest Connection comes in , with its ingenious Guardian devices . Each phone is placed inside one of these , which White describes as `` a fancy enclosure for protecting a cellphone , giving it a high-power microphone and an extra antenna , and powering it – which is of course the hard part . '' The Guardians sit in the trees , listening out for logging activity . The high-powered microphones they contain can pick up the sound of chainsaws and vehicles up to 1km away . When activity is detected , forest rangers can travel to the location and confront the loggers . These smartphone guardians are currently protecting areas of rainforest in Brazil , Cameroon and Sumatra , and Rainforest Connection plans to expand the project to Ecuador later this year . `` Simply having someone show up in real time and saying 'you ca n't be here ' and pushing the loggers on their way was an impressive enough event for them to never come back . We do n't want to demonise loggers – for the most part they 're just doing a job . The safer we can make it for everybody the better . '' Safer for indigenous peoples such as the Tembé , who live on a small reserve in the Amazon . `` Their survival is tied to the land – it may not be their primary purpose to protect it , but by being there they are able to keep the land more or less persevered , '' says White . `` The issue is , as more areas around them get damaged and there 's increasing encroachment from outside groups , there 's more and more pressure on them . '' `` The Tembé used to inhabit a much larger area , but now there 's only about 15,000 of them left and they 've been squeezed onto this one reserve that 's about 6,000km square . They 're pretty much surrounded on all sides by groups that are trying to come in and cut the trees down . '' The biggest issue for Rainforest Connection is powering the Guardians . They run on solar energy , and as densely-shaded rainforests are n't the most friendly environment for solar panels the devices have to be carefully positioned . `` Most [ solar panels ] you see on roofs are very fussy about the shadows you put on them . Even if just a tree branch is in the way it can reduce the power up by to 90 % , '' says White . `` In the forest this is the real problem – it 's 90 % shadow and 10 % sunlight . You occasionally have these rays of sunlight coming through the canopy , but they only last for a few minutes . '' Those small rays of light are called sun flecks , and they 're the only source of power White and his colleagues have to work with . Each guardian has an array of several panels , which are configured to capture the sun flecks when they break through . `` As long as sunlight hits any three or four of these panels then it 'll be generating power for the phone , '' adds White . `` One should be able to create more energy then the phone will need over a 24-hour period , but it takes a lot of power to transmit data over these great distances , so we 're trying to generate more than 25 watt hours in single day . ''

Having achieved success with the simultaneous theatrical and streaming release of its film Beasts of No Nation , Netflix has shown the world how lucrative it can be for streaming services to obtain and distribute their own films . Amazon clearly agrees , with Variety reporting that the company has acquired The Neon Demon , a highly-anticipated horror thriller from Nicolas Winding Refn , director of the cult classic Drive . Though The Neon Demon is not the first Amazon Original movie ( that honour goes to the upcoming Spike Lee joint , Chi-Raq ) , it is probably the company 's most high-profile acquisition , with a planned theatrical release slated for next year 's U.S. summer , followed by early window distribution on Amazon Prime Instant Video – not quite as impressive as Netflix 's simultaneous home and cinema releases , but it 's still pretty good . Chi-Raq and The Neon Demon are just the start of Amazon Studios ' grand plan , with the company having announced in January that it plans to bring 12 films per year to cinema screens and its streaming video on-demand service . The film has been described by its director as `` a horror film about vicious beauty '' , and stars Elle Fanning ( below ) , Jena Malone , Christina Hendricks and Keanu Reeves .

In the wireless world of cloud infrastructure and services , Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) just chucked a curve-ball . Or , rather , a Snowball . A 50TB hard drive weighing 20kg that can be quickly filled with data and posted to AWS for uploading to the cloud , Snowball is said to be a `` novelty '' , but one that will spread the cloud concept to companies with petabytes of archived data which they perceive to be un-cloudable , as it were . But can a $ 200 ( around £130 , or AU $ 280 ) – that 's the rental price of course – slab of hardware like Snowball really be the future of the cloud ? The Snowball concept was launched at October 's AWS Re : Invent 2015 event in Las Vegas in front of initially bemused developers , and it does at first seem at odds with the cloud data concept . Why is a cloud and IaaS ( Infrastructure as a Service ) company like AWS suddenly interested in producing bespoke hardware ? Because it wants business data in its cloud as quickly as possible , that 's why – and certainly quicker than the internet allows in most parts of the world . `` It 's actually very difficult to get large amounts of data from point A to point B , '' said Andy Jassy , Senior Vice President at AWS , at Snowball 's launch . `` Even for companies with a gigabit-per-second connection , it 's unlikely you want to saturate that connection to move data . If they use 10 % of that , which is pretty generous , it would take 100 days to load 100TB into the cloud – that 's a really long time . '' Jassy reckons that instead of taking 100 days to move 100TB , with a couple of Snowballs you can do it inside a week . `` That 's a very different model for getting your data onto the cloud , '' he said . AWS already has a physical Import/Export service that allows its customers to send it hard disks , but claims Snowball is cheaper than a company having to buy each disk separately – typically 1TB – load on encrypted data , and then sort out the logistics . `` There 's a lot of opportunity for human error , '' said Jassy . As well as that 50TB hard disk , Snowball is designed to be ultra-durable because it 's supposed to be posted . It may be totally in service of AWS ' core offering of cloud storage , but Snowball is n't just one piece of hardware . It 's two . On the side of every Snowball is a Kindle – an e-Ink version like the Paperwhite rather than a tablet like the Fire – which serves as both an address label and a tracking device . Snowballs can be daisy-chained , too , so together they can carry vast datasets . Snowball is n't just about storage . `` Snowball is a highly secure , shippable storage appliance that 's much simpler than a disk to load your data into – and it encrypts your data end-to-end , '' says Jassy . `` It has a tamper-proof secure enclosure , the container is easy to close and ship , and attached to it is a Kindle that allows you to automatically have a return label that you can track the progress of – both of it being shipped , and then being downloaded to AWS . '' Snowball is also dust-proof , drop-proof and can withstand up to 8.5 G-force . Although initial Snowballs will be 50TB , the size is expected to rise . However , although they cost $ 200 ( around £130 , or AU $ 280 ) per use , Snowballs remain the property of Amazon , and get sent back into the system after they 've transferred a big dataset .
After cruelly rendering the world 's book sellers obsolete , Amazon is doing the unthinkable and opening a brick-and-mortar store of its very own . Located in the University Village in Amazon 's Seattle home town , the 511 square metre-store will only offer around 5,000 books , which is considerably less than a traditional book shop . The reason for the modest range is that Amazon 's store will display each book with its cover facing outwards , rather than the spine . That means it 'll be easier to spot what you want , but less likely that the store will have it in the first place . Kindle e-readers and Fire tablets will also feature in the shop , although the shop will not offer customers the chance to pick up books purchased from Amazon 's online emporium . It 's unlikely Amazon 's looking to turn a profit from the project – the online retailer has put greater book stores to the sword than this – leaving the venture beyond the digital world as little more than a gimmick and vanity project . The store will open its doors at 9:30am on 3 November .

'T is the season to be retro , as a turntable and instant film became among Amazon 's best-selling products this holiday . Specifically , the Jensen JTA-230 3-Speed Stereo Turntable was the best-selling piece of home audio tech this Christmas , according to Amazon 's post-holiday debriefing , while Fujifilm 's INSTAX Mini Instant Film two-pack reigned supreme in the camera department . The semi-recent resurgence of vinyl records may have played a role in the Jensen turntable 's success , with the record player standing out among Amazon 's other top-selling ( though far less analog ) sound systems , which included the Yamaha V677 Receiver and the SONOS Play:1 smart speaker set . High sales of instant film were equally anachronistic , sharing the spotlight with high-tech offerings like the GoPro HERO4 Silver as Amazon 's best-selling item in its camera department . This holiday was also a watershed year for Amazon 's own products , with massive growth reported for both Amazon 's premium membership service , Amazon Prime , and sales for Amazon 's line of tablets , particularly the Fire , Fire Kids Edition , and Fire HD 6 . `` This was another great holiday season to be a Prime member , '' said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in the official press release . `` We welcomed three million new members [ to Amazon Prime ] in the third week of December alone . '' The expedited shipping that comes with an Amazon Prime subscription must have come in handy for several customers making last-minute holiday purchases , with the service reaching a record number of packages shipped worldwide this holiday , reaching to 185 different countries .
Amazon 's premium Prime membership was given a big subscriber boost in the run up to Christmas , with 3 million new members signing up to the service . Prime is Amazon 's multi-faceted membership scheme , which offers next-day delivery , the Amazon Prime Instant Video streaming service , music and photo storage . Not only did Amazon see its Prime membership balloon , but this also meant that views of Prime Instant Video doubled compared to the same time last year , with Man In The High Castle being the number-one television show to watch - the Amazon exclusive was almost five times as popular as anything else on the service . Interstellar was the most popular Prime movie on Christmas day but Hunger Games : Mockingjay Part 1 was the most popular over the entire holiday period . Amazon 's devices also proved popular , with double the amount sold compared to last year . Given that Amazon has released a bumper crop of new devices - including the Fire TV Stick , Fire TV 4K and some extremely cut-price tablets - this number does make sense . Oh , and there was one lucky person who managed to sneak in a very last minute Prime Now order that arrived at their door at 11:59 on Christmas Eve . Given the package contained Blue Buffalo Dog Treats and Fruitables Dog Treats , we are glad that the family 's dog managed to have a very merry Christmas .

Streaming services have proven they can stand up strong against traditional broadcasters when it comes to original programming , with Netflix taking the top spot for the most nominations for the 2016 Golden Globes , which were announced this morning . Netflix , which has announced it will have 31 original shows next year , dominated with eight nominations , beating out past top dog HBO , which last year had 15 nominations for the Golden Globes . This year , the Home Box Office nabbed seven nods . Amazon and Hulu have also proven they have the chops to compete with traditional broadcasters . Amazon Originals garnered five nominations , and though Hulu just got just the one nomination , it still beat out NBC , which got no nominations at all this year and is the network on which the Golden Globes 2016 awards ceremony is broadcast . Netflix 's Narcos and Orange is the New Black got two nominations each , while House of Cards , Frank and Gracie and Master of None each received a nod , as did Netflix 's first feature film , Beasts of No Nation . Hulu received its single nomination for Casual , while Amazon got two nominations for Mozart in the Jungle and three for Transparent . We 're also going to include HBO in this list , as the cable network falls into an interesting category this year , having launching its own standalone , cable-cutter 's option , HBO Now . HBO 's TV series nominees include Silicon Valley and Game of Thrones , which received only one nomination each , while Veep got two . Its TV movies or `` limited series '' Bessie , Show Me a Hero and Nightingale each received a nod as well . Interestingly , the `` Best TV series , comedy '' category has basically been taken over by streaming services this year , with the nominees made up of Orange is the New Black , Silicon Valley , Transparent , Veep , Casual and Mozart in the Jungle . Still , while it 's great to see non-tradtional broadcasters receive attention , we 'll have to wait to find out how well they actually do when the awards ceremony airs January 10 .

Amazon has launched a new `` Reader 's Edition '' of its Fire HD 8 , which it optimises the tablet for reading books . The way it works is that it slaps a special `` blue shade '' mode , which can be switched on and which will reduce the amount of blue light emitted by the screen . This creates a more pleasurable reading experience , as it 's the blue light which causes eye strain and which stops you from falling asleep . It means that the tablet is better optimised for use in low-light conditions - such as when you 're lying in bed , and want to crank the brightness down to the lowest setting . When you 're reading in blue shade mode , it will consume less battery power , and you can apparently expect your tablet to last 25 % longer . If this sounds familiar , it is because last week the company rolled out a software update that does the same thing to the other Fire tablets . Under the hood , the tablet is the familiar mid-range Fire HD 8 , which has an 8 '' HDish display ( running at 1280x800 ) , a quad-core 1.5GHz processor and 5MP camera on the rear . Sure , it is no iPad Air 2 , but if you want to use it mostly for reading it will do the job . To make the Reader 's Edition particularly appeal , Amazon is throwing in a year of Kindle Unlimited , which gives users access to a Netflix-style library of around 1m titles , as well as a `` rustic brown '' leather case to make it feel more like a book . Despite positioning the Reader 's Edition as a new product , it appears that these are the only two truly new features . So far the Reader 's Edition is only listed for sale on the US Amazon website for $ 249.99 , where it 's currently available for pre-order . This works out at around £170/ $ 350AUS - a premium on the standard Fire HD 8 , presumably to make up for the 'free ' Kindle Unlimited subscription .

Staring at a bright device screen can mess up your sleep , but Amazon has come up with a way to make sure its tablets do n't have you tossing and turning . Amazon 's latest software update for its Fire tablets brings out Blue Shade , a feature that reduces brightness and the amount of blue light emanating from a screen to your eyes . This gives the screen a warmer orange tint that not only is easier on the eyes in low-light settings , but could also improve the way you sleep . The health detriment of late-night electronics has become more widely known as of late . The Harvard Health Publications finds that blue light , given off by most LEDs , electronics screens and energy-efficient light bulbs , can be especially bad . `` Not all colors of light have the same effect , '' said Harvard in its online health letter . `` Blue wavelengths , which are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost attention , reaction times and mood , seem to be the most disruptive at night . '' `` Cool '' blue light , in contrast to the `` warm '' orange-yellow given off by incandescent lightbulbs or fire , can disrupt internal clocks and ward off sleep because it more closely resembles the light of the sun . Late-night exposure to blue light can also reduce production of melatonin , a hormone critical for getting a good night 's rest as it helps regulate your circadian rhythm . Reducing the use of blue light in electronics is nothing new , with plugins like f.lux allowing computer monitors to change screen brightness and color composition in accordance with the time . However , such functions have yet to become standard across smartphones and tablets , which are far more likely to be taken to bed for one last chapter , text , email check or Seinfeld episode . Blue Shade was not the only feature to come with the Fire tablets ' latest update . Among other changes , improved parental controls were added to help guardians choose what functions are available to their children and how long they can be accessed , which helps parents sleep easy in their own way .

It appears Amazon is stepping up its music service to match against the likes of Apple Music and Spotify . The online retailer/device maker/service provider has been working with the music industry to figure out licensing for a new music program that improves and expands upon Amazon 's current music offering , Prime Music , according to the New York Post . Prime Music currently comes packaged with Amazon Prime , a premium subscription that also includes two-day shipping , special savings on select items , and access to Amazon Instant Video . While Prime Music is part of the $ 99 ( £79 , about AU $ 139 ) per year membership program , Amazon 's in-development music service is expected to debut this fall with a standalone monthly fee of $ 9.99 ( about £6.95 , AU $ 14.11 ) . That said , the company is also considering offering a discount for Amazon Echo owners . The AI-augmented speaker , which stars in Amazon 's first-ever Super Bowl ad , is already compatible with Prime Music , implying an easy transition ( or promotion ) to an improved service . While details are slim , it likely wo n't be long before we learn what Amazon has in store for its mysterious new music service , as well as what 's to become of Prime Music .

Worried about your hoverboard ( or , more accurately , self-balancing scooter ) exploding ? Did you buy it from Amazon ? You might be in luck . With reports of certain hoverboards exploding or catching on fire , the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) is investigating the matter , and , in an update today , said that Amazon will be providing full refunds for hoverboards that are returned . `` For consumers who purchased a hoverboard from Amazon , they can return the product right now for a full refund , '' said US CPSC chairman Elliot Kaye in the statement . `` I want to commend Amazon for voluntarily stepping up , providing a free remedy and putting customer safety first . '' Back in December , Amazon began warning customers to return some hoverboards for refunds due to safety concerns in the UK , pulling listings down until hoverboard manufacturers provided documentation proving their boards met safety standards . Of course , Amazon already provides an avenue to return purchases if you are unhappy with what is delivered , though a request for a refund is required if the order was fulfilled by a reseller , rather than Amazon itself , and the request would then need to be approved by the seller . Currently , it 's unclear if CPSC means any hoverboard can now be returned and refunded through Amazon , and without having to request it from a reseller , or if there are only certain brands that will be eligible . Amazon has yet to make a statement , but we got in touch for clarification . If you are interested in returning your hoverboard , you can reach out to Amazon through your account or via the retailing giant 's contact page .

Amazon really wants to make online shopping easier , to the point where you wo n't even have to go on your phone or computer to order things yourself . After launching the Dash Buttons last year , which lets you re-order something with a connected button , Amazon has announced that the Dash Replenishment Service , which re-orders things automatically , has gone live today . The Dash Replenishment Service is set to work with connected home appliances , including washers , dryers , dishwashers and even blood glucose monitors and pet food dispensers . The appliances will be able to monitor when supplies needed start running low , like printer ink , and will make an Amazon order automatically . `` With Amazon Dash Replenishment , we want to make customers ' lives even easier so they wo n't run out of items like laundry detergent , pet food or printer ink again—customers simply activate Dash Replenishment when they are setting up their connected device and then rely on Amazon to automatically deliver those everyday essentials , '' said Daniel Rausch , Director , Amazon Devices . Currently , only connected Brother printers work with the service right now , but Samsung , Whirlpool , Brita , Purrell and others are set to integrate Dash Replenishment in the following weeks and months . Amazon is hoping to add more brands and companies in the future as well , having also released the API for the service as well .

If you 've been waiting to get an Amazon Prime subscription , this weekend may be the time to sign up . To celebrate winning two statues for its original series Mozart in the Jungle during last Sunday 's Golden Globes Awards , Amazon Prime subscriptions will drop from $ 99 to $ 73 this weekend only . The discount will be available starting tomorrow at 9pm PT and ends at midnight on Sunday , and is available to new sign-ups . Mozart in the Jungle lead actor Gael García Bernal won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Series , while the series won for Best Musical or Comedy Series . A Prime subscription gets you access to Amazon Prime Instant Video , as well as free two-day-delivery on certain products , and starting this week , 20 % off pre-order and new release games . This is n't the first time Amazon has discounted Prime subscriptions after winning at an awards ceremony : the company dropped the price to $ 67 after winning five awards at the 67th Emmy 's show last year . This time , Amazon will also allow non-subscribers to check out the show this weekend for free through the Amazon Video app starting on Friday at 9pm PT . It 's unclear if the discount is US-only , though we 've asked Amazon and will update this story once we hear back .

Along with all the other benefits your Prime membership gets you , Amazon is now offering members 20 % off new video games . The 20 % discount is only offered on physical copies of games , meaning no digital downloads , and is only available for pre-orders all the way up to two weeks after the game 's release . It seems to also be available for game accessories , like Nintendo 's amiibo and Lego 's Dimensions packs . It 's very similar to what Best Buy offers to its Gamers Club members , which also gives you 20 % off new games , but of course an Amazon Prime memberships also comes with 2-day free delivery and access to Prime Video . Amazon 's 20 % discount is applied during check out , and is n't offered on games that are bundled with consoles or those that are already discounted more than 20 % , though that would have been amazing . To see if the game you want is eligible for the discount , it should pop up on the `` offer message '' in the game 's Amazon listing . And if you 're not a Prime member yet , the discount is available during the free trial period , too . It 's just too bad it was n't available during 2015 's holiday shopping season .

Amazon Echo might be getting a little brother soon . A recent report from The Wall Street Journal says Amazon is making a beer can-sized version of the A.I.-equipped Bluetooth speaker and , more interestingly , that it would be revealed in a few weeks ' time . The new speaker , codenamed `` Fox , '' will likely come in at half the size of the current model and will cost less than $ 180 ( about £120/AU $ 260 ) , the current cost of the Amazon Echo . But all that cost cutting and space saving will come at a price . According to the report , the miniature Echo will use a push-to-talk button that activates Alexa , Amazon 's A.I . assistant , instead of always listening for a keyword . This is done to conserve battery life , but it will require you to get up anytime you want to get Alexa 's attention . Another new addition to the package , according to WSJ , is a docking station that will be used to charge the Echo 2 when it 's not in use . ( The current model requires a constant power source . ) A refined , portable Amazon Echo would make a lot of sense , as the original became somewhat of an overnight success for the company . The only thing Amazon 's updated speaker is missing now is a release date .

Amazon Canada has reportedly listed the price for the PlayStation VR on a pre-order listing , pegging Sony 's VR headset at CA $ 1,125.35 , which places it at just under US $ 800 . While the pre-order listing , which was reported first by Forbes , is still live , the price is no longer listed , with Sony telling the publication that `` This was an error by Amazon , we have n't announced price for PlayStation VR . '' This statement from Sony does n't exactly deny that Amazon 's listed price was incorrect , and if it does turn out to be true , it would mean the PlayStation VR would cost about $ 200 more than the Oculus Rift . In all likelihood , the price is probably a placeholder for when PlayStation does eventually announce the price that was accidentally pushed out before it was meant to . Still , it is interesting , as the page is listed on Sony 's official vendor page on Amazon , but now that we do know the price of the Oculus Rift , Sony may try to position the price of the PSVR more competitively with the Rift . Sony is still set to launch the PlayStation VR sometime in the first half of 2016 , so we 'll know the official price for the headset sooner rather than later .

TP Vision has today announced that its Philips Android TVs will now benefit from the Amazon Instant Video streaming service , helping bolster its content credentials . Coinciding with the launch of its 2016 range of Philips Android TVs it will be adding Amazon 's streaming service to the platform as a whole . All of Philips Android TVs will gain access to the 1080p streaming of its programming , though it has yet to specify which of the 4K TVs will have access to the Ultra HD content Amazon offers , suggesting some of its 4K sets might miss out . Considering the lack of a universal Amazon Instant Video app has been a major bugbear for Android TV users , this is a definite boon for Philips ' TVs . Previously only Sony 's Android TVs had access to the service , with Amazon disabling the app when sideloaded onto any other , non-Sony Android TV device . Quite why Amazon is limiting the use of its streaming service to paying customers outside of Sony , and now Philips , Android TV devices is still a mystery . We can only hope that it was a licensing deal with Sony and that this Philips announcement heralds the thawing of Amazon 's Android TV relations . TP Vision and Philips have also today announced the awesome AmbiLux TVs are going into full distribution by the middle of January . That 's only a few weeks away ! We were blown away by this logical conclusion of Philips ' Ambilight tech when we first played with it at the IFA show in Berlin last year . It packs nine pico-projectors into the back of a 65-inch chassis and by shining what 's happening on screen onto the wall behind , in a blurred-out way , it almost makes the bezel disappear completely when you 're gaming on it . It is quite possibly the most immersive gaming TV we 've ever seen .
Ford and Amazon have announced the two brands are 'exploring ways ' to get cars with Sync technology to communicate with smart home devices , meaning you could start your car just by telling your Amazon Echo that you 're about to take a drive . The two-way communications would then use Amazon 's Alexa commands to access remote vehicle features on cars with Sync Connect , or tell your home to get ready for your arrival as you approach . Remote start , locking/unlocking , checking your fuel levels , finding your car and other functions would be accessible from an Amazon Echo , so you would never have to pick up your phone for such simple tasks , if that 's your thing . If you want to chat to your home while out driving , you 'll be able to use Alexa 's smart home link functions to control your lights , garage door and other Amazon Echo-compatible Internet-connected devices . For owners that do n't have the latest Sync Connect technology , Ford is working on integrating support for the Wink smart home platform and vehicles with SYNC AppLink support . This would enable drivers to use in-car voice commands to control home functions , so you can ask the car to close the garage door as you 're pulling out or turn on your heating when you 're on your way home . Amazon confirmed during Ford 's press conference at CES that the service will be offered to customers 'later this year ' . I do n't think I 'd ever want to control my car via voice with an Amazon Echo , aside from the initial novelty , but controlling smart home devices from my car is something I look forward to , especially garage doors . Theoretically , with location-based services integration , I could have the car send commands automatically when I get within a certain distance from my house , so my lights are turned on , soothing music starts playing and my garage door would open when I 'm two blocks away , without the need of an additional in-car device . It does n't really make my life better in any meaningful way , but it would be cool .

Amazon has pulled all hoverboards from its US site . We scoured Amazon 's pages and found only one `` electric self-balancing scooter '' left for sale , the Airwheel Q6 Self Balancing Electric Unicycle . Mashable uncovered another board , the Cyncbit E-board : 2nd Generation Smart Self Balancing Technology . Both may have gone undetected since they are n't listed as `` hoverboards , '' instead using `` self balancing , '' but their time may be limited yet . Amazon looks to have targeted the rectangular riders with one wheel on either side - the kind Mike Tyson ate it on - just days after the US government deemed hoverboards unsafe . The US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) outlined new safety standards Friday , urging retailers and consumers to comply . It 's likely Amazon 's move is in response to the CPSC 's proclamation . The etailer had previously pulled some hoverboards before reinstating them - if manufacturers produced proof they were safe , that is . The company was also lauded by the CPSC for providing refunds for returned hoverboards . Now , it 's taken total action to get the boards off its virtual store shelves . We 've asked Amazon for further details on its latest decision and if it plans to sell hoverboards at any point down the line , but the company has remained quiet on its hoverboard policies in the past , so we 're not expecting much of a response . A check of Amazon 's UK site shows hoverboards are still on sale there , though the boards have also come under scrutiny in the region over safety concerns . You can still buy hoverboard accessories , like carrying bags , wheels and decals , but no actual , ride-able ( possibly combustible ) board , save for those few stragglers , in the US . Both Target and Toys-R-Us have also halted hoverboard sales for the time being .

Sony has used MWC to announce its brand new Xperia X and Xperia XA phones - but that 's not all , with the Japanese giant using the opportunity to show off concept designs as well . One of these concepts is for a personal assistant device called the Xperia Agent that will give you useful information , communicate with you and also allow you to control your home . It uses Sony 's voice technology to communicate and will be controlled by either your voice or gesture controls . It all sounds a lot like the Amazon Echo . The Xperia Agent will also have a projector to show content on blank surfaces in your home . Sony sadly does n't have an Xperia Agent device ready for the market , but it 's interesting that Sony has embraced voice assistant technology for the first time . If the voice technology takes off , we may see a competitor to the likes of Siri and Cortana in future Sony phones . The same projection technology is also used in another Sony concept called the Xperia Projector . The concept is a small device that will project onto any clear surface and also respond to touch , voice and gestures much like a smartphone does . Sony also revealed a concept for a wearable wide-angle lens camera called the Xperia Eye . It will attach to clothing or worn around the neck in the company 's smallest ever camera device . It would allow for 360-degree field of view and will detect faces and voices to make it easier capturing photos . This again is just a concept though , and in a year when other companies have created 360 cameras it 's a bit of shame Sony has n't got a finished product ready to put up for sale .

There 's no such thing as a dull week in technology land : if someone is n't defacing your childhood by turning your favourite games into movies they 're making ever-more-amazing smartphones , giving away game engines or just trying to fight online trolls . We 've seen all these things and more this week ; in fact there 's been so much news going on that the days have been blurrier than a Tim Cook iPhone photo . It 's yet another action-packed Week in Tech ! It 's been a rough week for Twitter , with uproar over its plans to make users ' timelines a little more like Facebook . It 's all about the numbers , as Michelle Fitzsimmons explains : `` The social network saw no growth between the third and fourth quarter of 2015 , staying flat at 320 million monthly active users . '' One of the biggest headaches is Twitter 's growing reputation as the place where people are abusive to others , and it plans to fight back with a 'superteam ' to take down the trolls . The Twitter Trust and Safety Council are `` anti-troll Avengers '' , reckons Hugh Langley , although as yet there are no details of how the Council will actually fight the abusers . Facebook 's Free Basics , its scheme to offer free internet access in developing areas , has suffered a blow in India : the Telecom Regulator Authority of India ruled that it was n't welcome in the second-most-populous country on the planet . The issue is net neutrality , and the Authority reckons that Facebook 's plans discriminate against the services that Free Basics does n't carry . All the pieces are falling into place : the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge will be launched at MWC 2016 on February 21 , and we 're getting a pretty good picture of what Samsung will be showing off . The S7 wo n't be among the cheapest phones launched this year , but it 'll improve upon its predecessor with a flatter back , better camera and faster processor , as well as cosmetic improvements . There may even be a fully waterproof model , and a version with a truly enormous battery . Samsung is n't the only firm launching a new flagship at MWC : LG 's doing it too , and it looks like the LG G5 could be very tasty indeed . Leaked benchmarks suggest it 's faster than the Galaxy S7 , while the Always On display means you 'll be able to see key information without waking the screen . Factor in a dual-lens camera for wide-angle shooting and you 're looking at one of the most interesting smartphones we 'll see this year . As ever , we 've pounced on every leak and rumour to bring you all the details you need . How 's this for awkward : you tweet a blurry photo from the Super Bowl and the internet calls you names because you 're Apple boss Tim Cook and you 're supposed to know how to use an iPhone . But such photo fails could happen to anyone – or at least to anyone who has n't read our guide on how not to do a Tim Cook when you 're shooting with a smartphone . Amazon is getting into gaming in a big way : it 's just launched a free , open source 3D game engine for developers based on Crytek 's CryEngine . It can create games for PS4 , Xbox One and PC , and it does VR too . Not only that but it 's royalty-free , can integrate with Amazon 's cloud services and the Amazon-owned Twitch , and has a clause in the small print that absolves it from responsibility in the event of a zombie infestation . Reboots are n't just for superhero movies and recalcitrant PCs . They 're for game franchises too , as Dan Griliopoulos explains : `` I 'm playing the new episodic Hitman , the first episode of the reboot , set around a packed French palais . After the poor reception of the recent Hitman games and the amazingly terrible movie , we 've all been approaching this semi-reboot cautiously . On the showing of this smart set-piece and the huge array of ways to approach it , we can afford to be more optimistic… On the evidence of this hands-on , IO has fixed the problems of Absolution . '' James O'Malley is n't impressed by the news of a Sonic the Hedgehog movie . `` In an apparent bid to destroy the last vestiges of humanity 's good will towards the Sonic brand , Sega 's President and CEO Hajime Satomi has revealed that the company is working on a film featuring the firm 's mascot , '' he writes , calling it `` the future 'yet another disappointing video game adaptation ' '' . The good news is that you do n't need to hide from it just yet ; it is n't out until 2018 . You could always go and see the Angry Birds movie in the meantime .

Who reads end user license agreements ( EULA ) ? Anyone ? Well , you might start now , because Amazon just trolled all of us in the service terms for its new game development engine , Lumberyard . In Section 57.10 of the agreement , as delightfully pointed out by Daring Fireball 's John Gruber without context , it is said that this tool can not be used with `` life-critical or safety-critical systems , '' like medical equipment , air traffic control and military applications . That is , unless the world is in the event of , `` a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh , blood , brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization . '' And the government has to approve it . Seriously , look it up . The beauty here is that this is both hilarious and , well , dead-ass serious , legally speaking . Amazon 's legal team may be joking now , but there damn well better be the servers and bandwidth to get us back on Netflix when everything on this spinning rock goes down the tubes . ( Oh , and the power , but they can wing it . ) I ca n't wait to see the EULA for the next iOS release . How are you going to protect us , Apple ? Via Polygon

Unexpectedly , Amazon has announced a free and open-source 3D game engine for developers . It 's called Lumberyard , and it 's a modified version of Crytek 's CryEngine – that should tell you that this is meant for AAA games . The engine can create games for PS4 , Xbox One and PC . Oh yeah , and the beta version is available right now . ( Not to mention it supports virtual reality . ) What sets Lumberyard apart is that it 's a . ) also royalty-free and b . ) comes with the option to integrate Amazon 's cloud services , which is how the company plans to make its money with this . Developers will have to pay to take advantages of Amazon Web Services , which will include Twitch ( which Amazon bought last year ) , letting gamers start streaming in a couple of button presses . Amazon GameLift , meanwhile , lets developers – or devs – easily scale multiplayer games up to support millions of players without paying out for a load of engineering work . There are others , but the point is that Amazon is offering the types of features serious devs are going to want . While the AAA game support is there , it 's the indie developers who could benefit most from Lumberyard , which offers the opportunity to try out ideas on a high-end platform that does n't require a subscription fee . Although it 's also royalty-free , Crytek 's indie subscription package costs $ 10 a month . Unreal is free up front but still has a royalty cost . Bigger developers will likely prefer to stick with the fully supported versions of these engines , but indie devs will probably be paying attention to Amazon 's new offering . The fact that Lumberyard will support virtual reality ( VR ) also puts Amazon well in place for the generation of developers who will be building for VR , while the integration of Twitch is hugely appealing for obvious reasons . Amazon has been busy in the gaming space , having bought both Twitch and Killer Instinct developer Double Helix Games in the past few years . It also released a controller for its Fire TV , which can be used to play games from Amazon 's app marketplace . However , it still has n't got any big titles to its name , and remains relatively small as a distributor when compared to Steam or iOS . Time will tell , but Amazon has a chance to prove itself as a serious player in the gaming space , and luring over indie developers will be a big part of making that happen . If today 's announcement confirms anything , it 's that Amazon is more interested than we thought when it comes to gaming beyond Android .

Alexa , the AI built into the Amazon Echo , can keep appointments , shuffle music , recall sports scores , and track the weather , but now the smart speaker knows a new trick : ordering pizza . Domino 's is bringing its AnyWare technology , which lets users place orders with the pizza chain using smart devices , to the Echo , so all you have to do to order a pie is utter a single voice command . To utilize instant vocal pizza-summoning , users just need to link their Domino 's Pizza Profile to the Amazon Alexa app , granting the AI knowledge of your preferred toppings and other crucial account info . From there , following the pie 's progress is as easy as asking Alexa to check in on the Domino 's Tracker , which shows the journey your meal takes , from the oven to the delivery guy to your doorstep . Once activated and ordered , Alexa will use the phone number associated with the order to keep you up-to-date on the pizza 's status . Amazon Echo marks the eighth platform for Domino 's AnyWare program . Hungry users can also order via smartwatches , tweets , smart TVs and even emojis . The ultra-convenient feature is rolling out to Echo just in time for the Super Bowl , an unofficial holiday that Domino says gives it five times more business than an average Sunday .

The dangers of using the wrong USB-C cable with the wrong device are becoming clearer by the day , and Amazon has now updated its listings so you wo n't be able to buy a dangerous cable . Amazon 's examples of prohibited listings section now reads : `` Any USB-C ( or USB Type-C ) cable or adapter product that is not compliant with standard specifications issued by `` USB Implementers Forum Inc '' . It comes after Google employee Benson Leung pointed out a problem with the OnePlus 2 charging cable and how it should n't be used with other devices . OnePlus has since updated the cables available with the OnePlus 2 so each is compliant with the USB-C standard . That cable and some others that were previously listed on Amazon do not meet the USB Type-C specification revision 1.1 , as they use the wrong type of resistor . It means it could damage your charger , hub or PC USB port if you use the cable with those devices . The latest step means Amazon has made sure that those cables and adapters wo n't be able to be sold on the online store and means deceptive listings that do n't meet the required levels of safety will now be taken down . It does n't mean you wo n't be able to buy the wrong cables from other places online or traditional brick and mortar stores though , so make sure you 're getting the right cable for your device .

The Raspberry Pi is a wonderfully versatile and inexpensive little bit of computing kit , and one that 's capable of being transformed into all kinds of gadgets if you know how - and apparently that list of gizmos includes the Amazon Echo . Alexa Voice Service Evangelist Amit Jotwani has posted a step-by-step guide on GitHub for the benefit of anyone keen to tap into the powers of the voice-controlled digital assistant . Jotwani 's job is to help developers get Alexa into third-party products , so he certainly seems well-qualified for the role . You do need a little coding knowledge and some familiarity with the Raspberry Pi but it 's a project that many people will want to tackle - and of course you then get yourself an Amazon Echo clone at the fraction of the price . It might be particularly attractive to computer tinkerers outside the United States , as the Echo has yet to go on sale anywhere else up to this point . The downside to the homemade rig is that it 's not always listening : you need to press a physical button to get the device to pay attention . The Echo is clearly a major part of Amazon 's plans for future world domination : it keeps adding new capabilities to the Alexa assistant app built into it , and two new Echo devices are launching in the United States this month . The plain-looking bits of hardware can now do everything from play your music on Spotify to order you an Uber , and there 's obviously much more to come from the service . In the meantime , if you want to hack together your own version , you know where to start . Via The Verge

Get ready to say `` Okay Google '' around the house a lot more because it sounds as if the Mountain View-based company is more than `` Okay '' with the idea of creating an Amazon Echo clone . Google 's top secret plans for a voice-controlled AI-controlled speaker system were outed in an expose about Nest by The Information . The product has not been reported on publicly until now . The information about a possible device was buried in a piece about the troubles of Alphabet subsidiary , Nest , which is surprising considering the home automation company is n't the one tackling the Amazon Echo rival . Nest has developed hits like the Nest Smart Thermostat and Nest Protect smoke detector , and most recently acquired Dropcam and rebranded its flagship device as the Nest Cam . But its lineup stops there . The report does n't specify which team is on the case , but there 's a good chance that that it would fall to the Chromecast team . After all , the technology behind Chromecast Audio does n't stray too far Amazon Echo has been a phenomenal success story for the top online retailer . It 's scored with critics and topped its sales charts since it became widely available in June 2015 . Currently , Amazon 's voice-commanded speaker ranks third on Amazon 's bestseller list , right behind the much less expensive Kindle Fire 7-inch and Amazon Fire TV Stick . It 's no surprise that Google wants to take on the Amazon Echo , and it actually came close to doing just that with last year 's microphone-less OnHub wireless router . Google has the design and functionality in place . If it really has plans to take on Amazon 's Alexa and its streaming music player , all it needs is a bunch of far-field voice recognizing microphones for picking up commands and Google Now dropped into the cylinder via Android .

Between electronics , groceries , fashion and home essentials , there 's not much you ca n't buy on Amazon . And adding to the list today , the etailer just launched its own Cable Store for internet , TV and phone packages . This special Amazon section lets you sign up to an internet plan or an internet , TV and phone bundle in `` three simple steps , '' which includes choosing a plan , completing an online credit check and scheduling an installation date . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 However , while Amazon 's Cable Store page looks set up to handle plans and bundles from a range of providers , only Comcast 's Xfinity products are available right now . There is a `` featured providers '' section , which would only make sense if Amazon plans on including other providers ... just not at the moment , it seems . If you go to the Cable Store today , you can sign up to a Xfinity internet , TV and phone plan or bundle without having to go through Comcast directly . There are about 30 plans available , though only new customers can sign up , according to Comcast . Current customers who want to change their plans will be able to go through Amazon later this year . While the plans are the same ones you 'd get from Comcast , signing up via the Amazon culd net you a gift card and other exclusive promotions . Amazon is also creating a dedicated customer service team to handle sales , billing , installation and technical issues , meaning you could end up having little to no interaction with Comcast if you wanted . The Cable Store is an enticing option for customers , especially if customer service is a priority . Amazon says its goal is to answer customer calls within 60 seconds , meaning you wo n't be stuck on hold for hours . If it adds more providers , Amazon may eliminate the need to ever have to interact with a cable company again , and that 's not a bad thing . Via Variety

Amazon Echo is already the most intelligent and personable Bluetooth speaker out there , but Alexa is expanding her wealth of knowledge even more , this time , with robust Fitbit integration . Once your Fitbit account is synced up with the Echo , Alexa will be able to provide verbal feedback to your fitness-related queries . Sure , you could get the same information by opening the Fitbit companion app , but Alexa 's verbal feedback could be just what you need to work towards your goal . To trigger the Amazon Echo to shout out bits of your daily fitness progress , start with `` Alexa , ask Fitbit… '' and fill in the blanks with the metric you 're curious about . Here 's an example : `` Alexa , ask Fitbit how many flights of stairs I climbed today . '' You can quiz the intelligent assistant on at least ten different areas that make up your overall health portrait with Fitbit . Feedback from Alexa for calories burned , steps taken and sleep tracking , ( the usual suspects ) are all supported . Even more granular details , like water consumption , weight , and resting heart rate can be recited by Amazon 's speaker . It depends ! The Amazon Echo has certainly burst through our expectations in terms of its longevity and ever-expanding support for clever IoT applications , like the numerous IFTTT if/then `` recipes '' . You should definitely consider it if you 're a tinkerer and want to get more out of your connected products , like the Fitbit Charge HR or Fitbit Surge , to name a few examples . On the other hand , relying heavily on the Amazon Echo ( at least , the original model ) for your music needs might result in a bit of disappointment , as the speaker itself does n't sound all that good . Amazon did , however , recently announce a few , new products that should alleviate that issue . The verdict is still out on the new Amazon Tap , a smaller , more budget-friendly version of the Echo . But the Echo Dot , which just contains the voice-activated brains of Alexa , plugs into any set of speakers to boost the experience .

A trawl through new patent applications always provides an interesting insight into the way tech companies are thinking , even if the products they describe never make it to the consumer market . Here 's an idea Amazon 's mulling over : selfies for payments . In other words , rather than using a passcode or fingerprint to authenticate your latest purchase at McDonald 's or Starbucks , you can use a shot of your face . There 's a catch though , because you 'd need to perform a certain action such as a smile or a wink to prove you really are who you say you are . According to the patent documentation , Amazon believes it 's more secure than a password , because no one can steal your face . This is n't too dissimilar to the face recognition technology we already have on some laptops and smartphones , but Amazon wants to add instant payments to the mix as well as specifying certain physical actions that mean the system ca n't be duped with a static photo . Online purchases could potentially be included too , so if you did n't want to stand in a store winking and grinning then you could do it in the privacy of your own home . The question is , will it stop you from making late-night eBay purchases after one too many beers ? You can read the patent in full over at the US Patent & Trademark Office website . As Re/code reports , several other companies , including Mastercard and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba , have similar technology in the pipeline too .

Even as Amazon continues to develop its drone delivery system , it 's cooked up a new plan to get one- and two-day deliveries to customers on time . Amazon has reportedly signed a 5- to 7-year deal to lease 20 Boeing 767 planes from Air Transport Services Group , according to Reuters . The planes will only deliver goods in the US , at least for now . At the moment , Amazon relies on courier companies UPS , which operates around 240 large planes , and FedEx , which has about 370 planes , to ship goods across the States . It uses USPS to ship internationally , though the service relies mostly on FedEx and other contractor fleets . While Amazon 's new fleet will only be used to handle deliveries in the US , the etailer could potentially be exploring similar deals across the globe . And this run goes well , it may need to . Having its own planes means Amazon wo n't have to rely on couriers nearly as much to deliver packages . This could be especially helpful during the holidays , when delivery systems become slammed . If anything , between its own truck drivers , plans for future drone package drops and now planes , we 're seeing more evidence of Amazon building a completely independent , end-to-end service that offers customers a quick , convenient and reliable shopping option . Why rely on others when you can do it yourself ? The first of Amazon 's leased planes is set to go into operation as early as April 1 .

Data encryption is a hot topic right now with Apple and the FBI at loggerheads over whether security agencies should have the ability to get at the messages , photos and other information kept on our smartphones . Yesterday news broke that Amazon had removed the local device encryption option from version 5 of Fire OS , the customised version of Android that runs on its tablets . No one was using it , according to the company . Well , a day is a long time in technology : today the firm founded by Jeff Bezos says full disk encryption will return to Fire OS in the next update due this spring . Good news for you , bad news for hackers . Encrypting a device makes it impossible for unauthorised users to pull meaningful data from it - it 's an integral part of iOS and has been available on Android since version 5.0 ( Lollipop ) . Agencies such as the FBI believe they should be able to decrypt data in special circumstances : tracking down terrorists , protecting national security and all the other usual crime-fighting endeavours . Apple and many other tech companies , on the other hand , think user privacy comes first - and argue that once decryption 'back doors ' are created , they will be used by criminals and hackers for nefarious purposes .

Last year , Amazon released an intriguing product called the Echo that was part smart assistant and part Bluetooth speaker . Now , the company has basically split the Echo 's dual personality into two separate devices called the Echo Dot , and Tap . One of the biggest limitations of Amazon 's original Echo was that you could n't take it anywhere because it always needed to be plugged in . Well now Amazon has a more portable solution coming soon called Tap . As appearances go , the Tap looks like any other portable speaker , but it comes with a mind of its own , allowing you to take Alexa on the road . Like the Echo and Echo Dot , you 'll be able to ask Alexa a host of questions . But unlike the Echo , which responded to you saying `` Hey , Alexa , '' users will now have to hit a little microphone button on Tap 's face instead . What 's more , you can take the Tap on the go and you 'll still be able to chat with Alexa , so long as you pair it to your smartphone and use the Alexa app . Amazon said the Tap is built with speakers that emit 360-degree sound to reach every corner of your room . Battery life should last for about nine hours of active usage , But what sets it apart from others is that it can pop off the bottom , enabling you to swap them out to keep the tunes going . The Echo Dot is essentially a smaller version of the original Echo that does away with the built-in speaker , while retaining the brains to power Amazon 's personal assistant , Alexa . The new device comes in a much more compact hockey puck shape and it still features the same signature ring of light to let you know when it 's thinking . The major difference between the Echo Dot and it progenitor is you can command it from any wired or Bluetooth-connected speaker . Even if you 're not speaking to Alexa in the same room where you placed the Echo Dot , it will be able to hear you , so long as you 're within an earshot of your connected speaker –assuming it has a built-in microphone . Amazon promises Alexa will still recognize all the same queries from the basic , like the time and weather , to the more nuanced , like whether or not Leo finally won an Oscar . You do n't have to hook up a giant booming speaker to use the Echo Dot either , as it has a tiny tweeter so you can use it as an alarm clock or timer . The Echo Dot is on sale starting today for $ 89 ( about £63 , AU $ 121 ) , meanwhile , the Amazon Tap retails for $ 129 ( about £91 , AU $ 175 ) – comparatively , the Echo costs $ 179 ( about £127 , AU $ 243 ) .

Some customers have found video games on Amazon are now `` exclusively for Prime Members '' . Customers are clicking through to buy items in both the UK and US and finding certain titles to only be available for those who pay for Amazon 's Prime service . The PlayStation 4 version of Grand Theft Auto 5 in the US is affected while FIFA 16 in the UK is also put behind an exclusive message . Customers around the world are also reporting other titles being restricted , including Tom Clancy 's Rainbow Six Seige , Assassin 's Creed Syndicate , Far Cry Primal , Battlefield Hardline , Dishonored : Definitive Edition , Metal Gear Solid : Ground Zeroes and Farming Simulator . Amazon has n't announced the initiative , but the `` exclusively for Prime Members '' logo has been around since at least April last year . Previously items as diverse as movies and even nappies have been affected . The exclusivity does not appear to apply worldwide . While the US version of GTA 5 is locked , the UK listing for GTA 5 on PS4 appears to be available for purchase by anyone . Meanwhile the Xbox one version of the game is unlocked across both US and UK . It 's not yet clear whether this initiative is meant as a means of dealing with low stock levels or whether it 's simply meant as an extra reason to sign up for Prime . However , the seemingly random exclusivity of titles across platforms and regions suggests that these titles have not been specifically chosen , indicating it may be an automatic measure to ensure stock is available for Prime customers . Thankfully you 'll still be able to buy affected titles if you are on one of Prime 's free 30-day trials . When asked for comment an Amazon spokesperson said `` From time to time , Amazon offers exclusive selection and pricing on select items , including select video games , for Prime members . Customers who are not Prime members can sign-up for a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime to benefit from these exclusive prices and 30-minutes early access to select Lightning Deals , or they can purchase these items or similar products from third party sellers often fulfilled and delivered by Amazon .

Mr Robot has been one of the big critical successes for Amazon Prime , but one of the bugbears of the series was the UK had to wait an achingly long time for it to land on the service . While the US watched weekly , the UK had to wait until the season had finished and then another month before they could stream all 10 episodes . Thankfully , there wo n't be such a wait for Season 2 . Mr Robot hits US screens again July 13 on the USA Network and Amazon has revealed to techradar that it will be airing the show just a day after the premiere and then weekly after that . Mr Robot centres around the life of a security developer by day and justice hacker by night , Elliot , played by the magnetic Rami Malek , who is recruited by Christian Slater 's Mr Robot into a motley band of hackers intent on bringing down corporate America . Very little has been given away about the story line except that this season shows the introduction of the FBI who are obviously very keen to catch members of F-society . The show has gained fans not only because of the myriad twists and intrigue of the story , but also because it is one of the few shows that depicts hacking accurately . Or as accurately as TV allows . Mr Robot will run for 10 episodes .

Amazon 's Fire is one of the cheapest tablets money can buy right now , but it means it comes with some flaws . One of those problems was a lack of internal storage and Amazon has realized and tried to remedy it by doubling the storage on the latest release . The Amazon Fire is now available in a 16GB option for £59.99 ( US $ 69.99 , around AU $ 110 ) while the 8GB option stays at £49.99 ( US $ 49.99 , about AU $ 92 ) . Those prices will also see adds served on your lock screen when the tablet is n't in use . If you 'd rather not be pushed more products you 'll have to shell out an additional £10 ( US $ 15 , around AU $ 20 ) . The rest of the tablet 's spec stays the same with a 7-inch display , 1GB of RAM , a MediaTek MT8127 processor , VGA selfie snapper and a 2MP rear facing camera . You can also now buy both storage versions of the tablet in magenta , blue and tangerine alongside the original black color choice for the tablet . Problem is , we did n't love the Amazon Fire tablet in our review , as we found it had a poor selection of apps , a dated screen and questionable OS design . That said for this price it 's a struggle not to recommend it , especially now with the added storage . What is n't clear is whether Amazon will continue to sell five Fire tablets for the price of four like it did on the original release - a quick dabble on the Amazon website suggests the deal is no longer available .

For the first time , US Amazon Prime customers will be able to pay for Amazon Prime Video separately from Amazon Prime ( the free one-day delivery service ) and they 'll be able to do it on a monthly basis . Previously US customers could only access Amazon Prime Video through a yearly subscription of $ 100 for video alongside other Prime services including one-day delivery . Until now there has been no monthly payment plan , nor has there been an option to pay for video streaming separately from other Prime services . This might have worked well for consumers who know they 're going to stick with their subscription for the whole twelve months , but does n't work as well for a viewer who wants to subscribe on a more ad-hoc basis for a month at a time . Engadget has calculated that paying monthly for the full Prime option ( including one-day delivery ) will pay an extra $ 32 over the course of a year , but considering most companies give a discount for paying yearly rather than monthly this is n't too surprising . UK pricing of Amazon 's services currently works differently from the US . Amazon UK already price their video services on a monthly basis as a result of having acquired this model from LoveFilm , whom they purchased in 2011 . Prime delivery services meanwhile are priced yearly . When asked for comment Amazon refused to say whether this change will have any implications for the pricing models of its services in the UK . The move appears to be intended to position Amazon Prime Video as more of a direct competitor to rival Netflix . The two have been trading blows over their increasing production and broadcast of content . Just last week we reported that Netflix had picked up the rights to stream the BBC 's new series of Top Gear , while Amazon reportedly paid $ 250m ( £175m ) to secure ex-Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond and James May for their own car show . Netflix has always operated on a monthly subscription model , the prices of which recently increased from $ 7.99 to $ 9.99 in the US ( from £5.99 to £7.49 in the UK ) .
Amazon 's Alexa virtual assistant technology is best known for being within your home on the Amazon Echo , but it 's now coming to your wrist as well . The new CoWatch is a smartwatch with Alexa waiting inside so you can ask questions or control your connected home directly from your wrist . The watch comes with a Super AMOLED touchscreen as well as a premium looking design with either black or silver stainless steel bracelets . You can track your activity with the wearable with step tracking as well as a heart rate monitor . CoWatch also claims to have 32 hours of battery life . Amazon now allows developers to take control of Alexa 's voice technology . It released the Amazon Voice Service in 2015 to allow developers to play around with the technology and integrate it into other devices . The CoWatch is the first wearable product to be announced with Alexa integration , but it may not be the last . CoWatch is up for pre-order soon with early-bird pricing available for all those who sign up via the official website .

One of the true tech joys in my life is digging out an ereader which was buried at the bottom of my bag for a few weeks and feeling overjoyed when I can just sit back and enjoy a book without having to worry about battery life . If you buy the new Amazon Kindle Oasis though , that dream might be dead . Amazon has seen fit to shrink the battery within its brand new Kindle in order to change the traditional ereader design to something a little bit different . This time Amazon has focused on slimming down the body of the device for a lighter , thinner and more comfortable reading experience . Instead of the average six week battery life of a Kindle , Amazon confirmed to me its new device only lasts two weeks between charges . That 's not good enough . During my brief time using the Kindle Oasis I 'd agree it is by far the best reading experience of any ereader I 've used , but I 'm still very disappointed at that drop in battery life . Most customers for a Kindle Oasis are likely to already own an ebook reader . At £269.99 ( US $ 289.99 , AU $ 449 ) , Amazon 's premium ereader is pitched at those looking to update to a newer , sleeker version , rather than those jumping into the world of ebooks for the first time . That said , will Amazon make it clear to customers that battery life wo n't be anywhere near as good as you 'd expect from an Amazon ereader ? I fear it wo n't . When you buy a McDonald 's meal you do so because you know what you 're getting – imagine getting a Big Mac box , opening it up and realising it was just a cheeseburger . It 's the same with the Kindle – I expect an impressive battery and I worry Amazon wo n't make it clear to users that they 're in for a different experience . Amazon has taken steps to make the battery life stronger , but not in a way you may expect . There 's a smart battery case included in the box that looks gorgeous with a leather front and attaches to the back of your ereader to give you extra charge . Stick one of these on and Amazon assured me you 'll then get up to seven weeks battery life - but it means losing that revolutionary design the Kindle Oasis is selling itself on ( and you 're paying through the nose for ) . The Kindle Oasis is an impressive idea and a step in the right direction for ereaders in general , but it 's not worth crippling the key draw of an ereader . Parting with £169 ( US $ 219 , around AU $ 250 ) for a Kindle Voyage felt like too much in 2014 , but here we are two years later and we 're being asked to spend considerably more to get an Oasis . You 're paying more for less in terms of battery , and it 's hard to sell the Oasis for that reason . So , who is the Kindle Oasis really for ? Bookworms . But that 's too broad a term . We 're looking for affluent bookworms who prefer digital scripture over the printed page - which suddenly makes the market a very defined niche . Even those amongst my team who call themselves literature fans are finding the Kindle Oasis a hard sell . Of those who take the plunge and buy one , some will be disappointed by the battery life . Amazon has taken a step back in the search to make the ultimate ereader that little bit more like paper . The biggest USP of a physical book or ereader is that you do n't need to charge it every night to read it ... but that just got a little bit harder if you buy a Kindle Oasis .
The Amazon Kindle Oasis is the fourth ereader to join the current Kindle line up , and it 's the retail giant 's most expensive , and lightest reading device ever . Just how expensive ? Well the world 's longest overdue book – which was 47 years overdue from a library in Illinois , USA - cost the borrower US $ 345.14 ( about £203 , AU $ 451 ) , which is still less than the $ 289.99 ( about £269.99 , AU $ 449 ) Amazon Kindle Oasis . The Kindle Oasis has a brand new form factor compared to previous Kindles . It 's exceptionally thin on one side - just 3.4mm thick - while over on the opposite side is noticeably chunkier in an attempt to make it even easier to hold one handed . It weighs 131g making it the lightest ever Kindle , a record previously held by the 180g Voyage . The screen from the Kindle Paperwhite is here as well offering 300ppi , but the real highlight is the 60 % brighter display thanks to a redesigned front-light . The battery life of the Kindle Oasis is less than other Kindle devices thanks to the slimmer design , with Amazon claiming you 'll get two weeks of usage from a single charge . However , every Kindle Oasis also comes with smart power case in the box which has an additional battery built in to boost your usage . It easily clips onto the ereader , giving you a stylish case as well as keeping you going for an average of seven weeks between charges . The Oasis comes with the latest Kindle software meaning you get the redesigned interface the company rolled out earlier in the year . The problem with the Kindle Oasis may well be the price . It sits at the top of the Amazon Kindle range and you 'll still be able to buy the cheaper Kindle , Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Voyage .

Top Gear is currently in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the most-watched factual TV programme in the world . Thanks to the BBC 's brilliant record of shipping its programmes worldwide , it 's a show that 's watched by 350 million people in some 214 territories . As a brand there 's not much bigger , so the news from Buzzfeed that Netflix has secured the rights to Top Gear outside of the UK is massive . It 's yet another step to make sure that its main streaming rival , Amazon Prime , does n't find itself in Pole Position with the rival show it 's creating with Top Gear alumni Jeremy Clarkson , James May and Richard Hammond . There 's no doubting that Clarkson and co 's car show will be big but , for Amazon , it has to be big . The sum it paid to have the rights to the series is vast . The only reason the show is parked with Amazon is because of a big bidding war . As Netflix CEO Ted Sandros told Buzzfeed : `` They bid themselves out to many people and to the highest price , like most creators do . It 's a natural process and Amazon paid the highest price . '' Netflix has n't done this with Top Gear . It has n't had to pay the millions for the hosts . It has n't had to pay the millions for the stunts . And if it is indeed part of its current deal with the BBC , then it 's very unlikely to have dipped much further into its own vast pockets to secure the license . The outlay , then , is minimal while Amazon chief Jeff Bezos told the Telegraph that its car show will be `` very , very , very expensive , '' for Amazon . `` They 're worth a lot and they know it . '' According to The Financial Times `` a lot '' equates to £160 million ( $ 250m ) . The BBC used to make £50 million a year out of Top Gear , which included DVD sales , merchandise and live shows . Oh , and its ability to sell the series globally , according to the Guardian . For Amazon to just break even over the contracted three series it will have to better this . There is no doubt , for Amazon , the car show it will get from Clarkson and co will be the biggest show ever for Amazon Prime , possibly ever . The kudos that comes signing up three former Top Gear stars is massive , as is the press , but then so is the weight of their pay checks . It 's clear that Amazon hopes to one day oust Netflix as the streaming king but it still has a long way to go . So far , it 's made some brave if clumsy decisions to push Amazon Prime as much as it can . Currently for £79 ( $ 99 ) you can get Amazon Prime bundled with free one-day delivery , Amazon Music , the Prime Kindle eBook Library , Prime Music and Prime Photo storage . It 's so close to throwing in the kitchen sink , yet people still prefer Netflix . According to research by Enders Analysis , in the UK , Netflix is outpacing all of the current VOD offerings combined . It believes that in 2015 Netflix saw 37 % growth , adding 1.8 million new subscribers pushing its user base to 5.2 million . In contrast Amazon Prime , according to the same research , has just 1.6 million paying subscribers . How has Netflix done this ? Through savvy advertising and clever show creation . Netflix will always be known as the house that House of Cards built but then there 's also Daredevil , Better Call Saul , Breaking Bad 's final season , Orange is the New Black ... it 's had hit after hit , or at least perceived hits given it rarely gives out its viewing figures . Amazon Prime 's Originals success has also been fantastic - thanks to Emmy-embraced shows like Transparent - but fleeting . Amazon has yet to ride the wave of success as well as Netflix . Which brings us back to that car show . Clarkson , May and Hammond are Amazon 's best shot yet at driving Prime into the prime time , but if it thinks it has bought something more powerful than the Top Gear brand , then it needs to come up with yet another plan .

We learned of a new Kindle just over 24 hours ago , and already reports are rolling in as to what the 8th-generation ereader will bring . Word from sources of The Wall Street Journal is that Amazon is slimming down its slate thanks to extended battery life offered by a rechargable protective case . Smaller batteries inside the tablet would allow for a thinner figure , while the boost from the cover would shore up life for longer reading . OK , rechargable case . Big whoop , you say . But the chatter does n't end there : Amazon is also reportedly developing another new Kindle case that would charge thanks to the sun . This solar-charged cover probably wo n't be ready anytime soon , a source noted , though as Amazon ( like Apple ) tries to go greener , it does n't sound as far-fetched as one might think . The new Kindle is reportedly codenamed Whiskey , while the new cases are called Soda and Sunkiss . We think which one is the solar case is pretty obvious . As for shaving off some girth for the new ereader , it 's not like older Kindles are clunky . The Kindle Voyage is only 0.3 inches thick and weighs 6.7 ounces/0.4 pounds , but as tablets slim down across the industry , it 's no surprise Amazon will ( likely ) tout the new Kindle 's ( likely ) thinness and ( likely ) lightness . The rechargable and solar-charging cases are good gimmicks , but as accessories that will no doubt have their own price tags , they may be met with some customer backlash . We 'll know all about the new Kindle next week . Until then , let the rumors continue to fly .

Considering how much attention the likes of Facebook and Google are giving them , conversational , AI-powered bots are our future , and the Amazon Echo is one of the most well-known smart home devices with a software-driven personality . Alexa is the name of the AI and search technology that powers the Echo , and Amazon just released an online tool called Echosim.io so you can try out the technology for yourself , even if you do n't have one of Amazon 's devices at home . You 're going to need to log into the site using your Amazon credentials and grant the website access to your microphone , but setup just takes a couple of minutes and the service is free for anyone to make use of . You could have a Siri vs Alexa head-to-head challenge , if you really wanted to . It 's not the first time Alexa has appeared outside of the Echo , as we 've also seen the smart assistant appear on a smartwatch , and Amazon seems keen to have its software technology available on a whole host of devices in the future . With Google Home arriving later this year and Apple rumoured to be building an Echo competitor of its own , the quality of the underlying code is going to be crucial in helping customers pick one always-on smart home device from another . There are now several Echo devices on sale , though they 're still only available to customers in the US - how about some love for the rest of the world , Amazon ? If you do n't own an Echo , then Echosim.io is the next best thing . Here are our early impressions of Android N : Via The Verge

The fight between Amazon and Microsoft is well documented in the US . According to one analyst , it amounts to something of a `` street battle , '' in which only one side can win and the spoils of which will make either company rich and powerful . The story in Europe is similar , but has received much less attention despite it being far more interesting , mainly because it 's in the early stages . According to an IDC estimate , the European market for cloud services is worth around $ 11 billion a year ( about £7.5 billion , or AU $ 15 billion ) , which is not inconsiderable , and it 's almost a fair toss-up between Amazon and Microsoft . The two companies are taking vastly different approaches to the problem , which has been put into legal focus by a ruling last year that stated US companies could not simply ship customer data out of Europe . Instead , it must be stored on European soil . `` Microsoft comes from the top down , '' said Giorgio Nebuloni , a researcher for IDC who focuses on systems and infrastructure in Europe , in an interview last year . `` Amazon comes from the bottom up . '' This difference may sound odd , but it means a lot . Essentially , Microsoft already has a ton of relationships with big corporations who use Office , Windows , and so on already . Selling them Azure , its cloud services infrastructure , should be easy and this is where the company excels . Amazon , meanwhile , is much newer to the enterprise game having launched Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) in 2006 . This means it can leverage the changing tides of the industry – adoption of technology , need to interact with customers , apps , and so on – to get in on the ground with newer , more nimble companies . Each has its upsides and downsides . Microsoft , for instance , lands the big contracts but may miss out on the next 'unicorn ' – the term for a privately held startup valued at over a billion – while Amazon may get it . The two companies offer relatively similar solutions : Platform-as-a-Service , which is where apps live online , Software-as-a-Service , and Infrastructure-as-a-Service . All of these are , essentially , doing each respective thing for a monthly fee . According to Ben Thompson , an independent analyst for Stratechery , Amazon has created an `` internet tax '' with AWS because it got in on the ground with a host of smaller companies which have now become much , much bigger . `` The larger AWS becomes , '' Thompson writes , `` the greater advantage Amazon has in pricing AWS ' services , which means they can earn ever more business . '' This , in turn , will likely end up with Amazon having its fingers in so many pies that its competitors can no longer keep up . According to a report from Gartner , this could well be true but Microsoft still has a fighting chance . `` In addition to this frustration on a technical front , enterprises both large and small often report a degree of dissatisfaction in the overall engagement process with AWS compared with other IT vendors that they purchase from , '' the report says , hinting at Amazon 's biggest flaw . `` Buyers ' decades-old habits and expectations do n't change easily , '' the report continues , `` and if established IT vendors can bring a credible competitor to market ( as Microsoft has been able to do with Azure ) , Amazon will likely feel even more pressure in this area . '' This disadvantage is unlikely to topple Amazon completely , but it could make it harder for the company to exert total control over the market for cloud services , especially in the kind of specific markets that are found within Europe . `` Amazon 's advantage is that you do n't always have to pander to the local markets , '' said Nebuloni . `` However , that 's one of the reasons why , in France in particular , there is an advantage for Microsoft because they have a local partner . ''

Last week 's unveiling of Google Home , a smart device that embeds an artificial intelligence inside of a speaker , has left many wondering when Apple will announce an Amazon Echo clone of its own . Well , if one source close to VentureBeat is right , that device is already in the homes of hundreds of thousands of people already . `` They want Apple TV to be just the hub of everything , '' the source told VentureBeat . They being the executives at the aforementioned Cupertino company . What the source is unclear about , however , is whether the Apple TV in question , the one that can answer inquiries , map out your daily schedule and play music on command , is new hardware or an update that 's coming to the existing streaming device . While we were expecting some sort of smart home device to be shown off at the company 's upcoming WWDC 2016 keynote , integrating Siri into Apple TV is a move that makes sense . Apple has brought several software updates to tvOS over the last few months , many of which have greatly expanded Siri 's functionality allowing her to search the App Store alongside the Movie and TV storefronts . Admittedly , Apple might be better off developing a stand-alone device , similar to the Echo and Home . Obviously , the microphone inside the remote would allow users to call upon Siri when they 're holding it , but that 's a far more limited ability than the Echo and Home which can be voice-activated from anywhere in the room . A successor to the Apple TV seems a bit … preemptive , as the latest hardware iteration does n't feel anywhere close to complete yet . Also , while Apple 's phones might be on the annual release schedule , the Apple TV has historically needed to wait two or three years between iterations . Still , maybe this is what Apple had planned all along . By integrating a microphone into the remote , Apple has given itself a wealth of potential new features that could come via software updates .
Finished binging every episode of Bosch and The Man in the High Castle ? Fear not - Amazon Video wo n't be short for content anytime soon , as the streaming service debuts eight new shows next month . The upcoming pilot season contains two hour-long dramas and six children-oriented programs , Deadline reports . Subscribers to Amazon Video in the US , UK , Germany , Austria , and Japan will be able to tune in to each show June 17 . The two long-form shows - The Interestings and The Last Tycoon - adapt the best-selling novels of the same name by Meg Wolitzer and F. Scott Fitzgerald , respectively . The Interestings describes the friendships and tribulation faced by a group of art-loving youth as they confront adulthood , while The Last Tycoon is a `` Mad Men set in Hollywood '' sort of jam . The six pilots for the youngins vary in style and audience , but do n't skimp on talent , such as Morris and the Cow , a cowboy cartoon comedy featuring animation and writing staff from the brilliant Bob 's Burgers , and Sigmund and the Sea Monsters , a live-action series executive produced by Sid and Marty Krofft of H.R . Pufnstuf fame . ( Kids , ask your parents . ) Amazon will also be taking in feedback for each pilot to see which will become fully-developed into an Amazon Original Series for all Amazon Prime subscribers . This process has proven useful to Amazon 's video offering in the past , resulting in award-winning series like Mozart in the Jungle and Transparent . Keep that in mind when you cozy up for a late night of TV this June - it 's not being indulgent , it 's focus testing !

Apple is reportedly working on an Amazon Echo competitor that will build Siri into a smart speaker of its own . A new report from The Information claims Apple is preparing to launch a software development kit ( SDK ) to allow developers to tap into Siri , Apple 's mobile assistant . This means app developers can let Siri perform tasks like calling an Uber or ordering food . These functions would fit right in with a new rumored smart speaker the iPhone maker is also said to be working on . Siri already has some interoperability with apps like Yelp and Yahoo , but those integrations were made on an app-by-app basis . The release of an SDK means app developers can integrate their apps with Siri without striking a deal with Apple first . The report claims Apple began working on the hardware for its home assistant before Amazon launched Echo in mid-2015 . Apple 's device will apparently feature a speaker and web connectivity , not surprising considering both Echo and the just-announced Google Home have the same features . Google revealed Home , its own Echo competitor , at last week 's IO conference . The speaker is powered by the company 's new AI assistant , simply called Google Assistant . Expect Apple 's in-home assistant to support the company 's AirPlay audio streaming tech as well as integration with HomeKit , its smart home backbone . Apple will likely announce the Siri SDK during its WWDC 2016 conference , going down in San Francisco in just a few weeks . Though still unclear whether the smart speaker will also make a debut , we doubt Apple will show off its new Siri powers without a shiny new device to house them in . Via 9to5Mac

Cost-conscious Amazon shoppers , prepare to be bummed : The internet warehouse is reportedly putting the kibosh on its refund policy that paid back customers who bought an item before it went on sale . Similar to other megastores , Amazon entertained a price-match policy that reimbursed shoppers who recently purchased an item from the company 's website or select retailers at a higher price , refunding them the difference . Redditors noticed the change earlier this month , a trend also picked up by Earny , a company that notifies users when an item they purchased drops in price so they can get a better deal . The policy , originally designed to get customers the lowest cost for televisions , was only extended to other items as an exception , an Amazon spokesperson told Recode . This could explain why the company decided to cull back on refunds , especially given its penchant for discounts and sales , but it could also come at the cost of its high reputation for customer service . It appears as though it 's keeping the discount-refund policy for TVs intact . As of right now , there seems not to be any change in Amazon 's return policy , meaning that vigilant customers may begin cancelling and re-ordering purchases from the site just to get a better deal - a scenario that we can see becoming ugly for both sides of the business .

It 's not unusual to hear Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos talking about failures , but his latest comments about failing in context of the Fire Phone are particularly refreshing to hear . In an interview with The Washington Post , which Bezos bought for $ 250 million in 2013 , the Amazon boss made some honest comments about failing at scale in response to a question about lacklustre demand for the company 's first smartphone , the Fire Phone . `` If you think that 's a big failure , we 're working on much bigger failures , '' said Bezos . `` And I am not kidding . And some of them are going to make the Fire Phone look like a tiny little blip . '' `` You kind of have to back up because it is our job , if we want to be innovative and pioneering , to make mistakes . '' Bezos talked about the growth of the company , which now has over 250,000 employees , and how that effects the scale of the mistakes . `` The size of your mistakes needs to grow along with that . If it does n't , you 're not going to be inventing at scale that can actually move the needle . '' `` You need to be making big , noticeable failures '' . He 's not kidding - Amazon has had its fair share of sinking ships over the years , from its hotel booking site Destinations to its peer-to-peer money service WebPay . But for each of these failures Amazon has had a success , from Kindle to Echo to , of course , the behemoth retail site itself .

Google is determined to make your home a little smarter with the announcement of Google Home , a Wi-Fi speaker with a built-in voice assistant announced at its Google IO keynote today . This follows weeks of Google Chirp rumors and is a salvo against the Amazon Echo . Like the Echo , Google Home will use the newly unveiled Google Assistant to answer your questions and , eventually , control smart devices all over your home . The first wave of Google Home-compatible devices will be , perhaps unsurprisingly , the Nest line of products . `` When I walk into my house , I want to be able to continue to have access to the Google Assistant . But I should be able to interact with it in a hands-free way simply using my voice without having to take out my phone , '' said Mario Queiroz , vice president of product management at Google . `` This is why we are creating Google Home , a device which will be available later this year . '' The major selling point of the new hardware is that it combines Chromecast software that allows for multi-room audio support , a voice assistant from Android and comes built into a speaker . The unit itself is vaselike , and Google says that the base of the speaker can be customized to match your home decor . Google Home will allow you to access songs , playlists , albums , artists and podcasts from music services just by asking with your voice . Or , according to Queiroz , you can send music from your Android or iOS device through Google Cast to any connected speaker in your home . Google Home lets you control your video content , too . `` Want to watch that episode of Jimmy Kimmel or the trending YouTube video on your TV ? Just tell Google Home and the content will appear on the biggest brightest screen in your house , '' Queiroz said . Unfortunately , you 're going to have to wait a few months to get your hands on one – the first Google Home units wo n't be available until later this year .

For the past two years , Alexa – Amazon 's artificial intelligence that comes built into the Amazon Echo smart speaker and Amazon Fire TV – has steadily expanded her capabilities . That 's why she might be giving herself a promotion , from your Siri-like personal assistant to the manager of your burgeoning smart home . According to The Wall Street Journal , Amazon has an ambitious plan for its increasingly intelligent AI and has begun partnering with smart home product manufacturers like Ecobee to ensure the next wave of domestic electronics are Alexa-enabled . It 's been ramping up its external partnerships slowly – most recently with Ford to allow some vehicles to open and close their garage door without a remote – which could potentially mean that Amazon is prepping for a more comprehensive attack on the smart home space later this year . `` We believe the next inflection point in terms of user interface is voice , '' David Limp , senior vice president of devices at Amazon , told The New York Times . One possible interpretation of Amazon 's growth in the IoT space is that it plans to contend with Google 's likely-to-be-announced smart home products and Apple HomeKit , evolving from a hobbyist-level smart home device to a full-blown ecosystem . Amazon seems to see real potential in the smart home space , and has already built out some of that functionality . Alexa is currently compatible with the Samsung SmartThings platform , Philips Hue lighting system and WeMo smart switches . But even though Amazon has a head start on Google , it 's not going to be an easy fight . The Mountain View-based search giant has an army of hardware partners thanks to its egalitarian Android operating system while Amazon has few . As much as Amazon would n't want to admit it , enabling the 1.4 billion Android devices to control products in homes around the world might put an early kibosh on its ambitious roadmap for Alexa ... of course , Google still needs the home hardware to make that happen . Alexa has come a long way in two years , yes , but Amazon is n't done yet . `` Someday in the future – that might be years or decades away – [ Alexa ] could answer everything that you would ever ask it , '' Limp said . And , who knows , maybe owning two omnipotent artificial intelligences wo n't be such a bad thing after all .
Google will announce its voice-activated home device during the IO 2016 developer conference on Wednesday , anonymous sources speaking with The New York Times confirmed . We previously reported Google would come out with its own take of Amazon 's Echo speaker called Chirp , but that was likely just a code name . Google Home will reportedly come to market in the fall , but Google is already far behind the competition . Google first announced its home automation initiative , dubbed Android @ Home , back in 2011 , but did n't do anything with it . The company then purchased home automation company Nest for $ 3.2 billion in February 2014 . Google also released a line of smart routers called OnHub , made by partners Asus and TP-Link . OnHub recently received support for IFTTT , a software platform that can help users perform simple tasks like alerting parents when a child comes home . Google already has its own mobile voice assistant in Google Now , but Google Home will be tailored to performing tasks around the house . Amazon carved its own niche in the home with its Echo speaker and its Alexa voice assistant . Amazon Echo can currently perform tasks like calling an Uber , ordering groceries and reading the top news of the day . Apple also has its own Siri voice assistant , but its abilities are quite limited compared to the competition . Siri is great for asking basic questions , but is n't smart enough to perform complex tasks just yet . However , Apple does have its own HomeKit framework to help developers integrate Siri into smart home devices . Facebook is also dabbling with artificial intelligence with its chatbots , which aim to help users perform simple tasks , like finding news and even online shopping . We 're hours away from seeing Google Home in the flesh . For Google 's sake , let 's hope it 's not an unwelcome house guest .

Remember those Amazon Dash buttons that let you re-order things like toilet paper with just a press ? Well , now there 's a new version that does a whole lot more . The new Amazon Dash button , called AWS IoT Button , lets users tap into Amazon 's cloud service to enable the button to perform various tasks . Amazon lists some of its potential uses like calling an Uber , opening your garage door , switching on your Philips Hue bulbs or ordering a pizza . While the possibilities of what you can do with the AWS IoT Button are limitless , it 's still only useful for a single task , so you 'll need to pick up a bunch of them if you want to automate your life . The buttons hook up to your Wi-Fi and features a battery life of 1,000 presses . You ca n't replace the battery , so you 'll have to order a new one when it dies , which could be a problem if you use the Button frequently for things like unlocking a door . The AWS IoT Button integrates with third-party APIs from services like Twitter , Facebook , Twilio , Slack and others . It shares the same backbone as Amazon 's Alexa voice assistant , meaning whatever tasks she can perform are mappable to a Button . People have been hacking the normal Amazon Dash buttons for a while now , but now Amazon is offering the customizable button users have been asking for . While the Amazon Dash buttons are basically free after your first purchase , the AWS IoT Button will reportedly cost $ 19.95 each , according to SlashGear . Amazon 's website currently lists the button as unavailable and does n't include a price .

Google is reportedly working on a counterpart to Amazon Echo , along with its own sound effect-based codename , `` Chirp . '' While rumors have been bubbling since March about a Google smart speaker , more information has spilled out confirming the project thanks to Recode . Copying the concept of Echo - including its AI assistant , Alexa - should n't be trouble for Google . Several Android phones already access the company 's wealth of search functions with a simple voice command . Additionally , integration with Google 's services , like Google Play Music and Google Cast , add all sorts of potential to what its own speakers can do . That said , it will also have to step up and match Alexa 's ability to order pizza with a single command to be taken seriously , in our opinion . Little else was revealed besides a codename and that it will resemble its wireless OnHub Wi-Fi router , but we might learn more during Google IO 2016 next week . The company will have a full plate this year , with the potential plans for Chrome OS , self-driving cars , artificial intelligence , and much more on the docket .
Amazon Prime 's answer to Top Gear finally has a name and it 's - drum roll - The Grand Tour . Nope , it 's not quite what we were expecting either . The show will be presented by former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond and James May . Just last month the three presenters released a short video poking fun at the show 's lack of a name . The three have apparently been too busy experimenting with the Ray-Ban glasses customiser to have come up with a name until now . One of the big rumours was that it would be called Gear Knobs , but this was shunned after it was revealed they could n't use a name with Gear in the title due to copyright issues . Amazon has released a video via Twitter showing what they claim to be rejected names for the new show . The outtakes include 'Automates ' , 'Tripop ' , 'Selling England by the Pound ' , 'Watcher of the Skies ' , ' A Small Puddle of Excellence ' , 'Ace Biscuits ' and finally 'The Clarkson , Hammond and May Car Show on Amazon ' . Good to see Clarkson has n't lost his sense of humour since making the shift to Amazon . The BBC also has a new series of Top Gear in the works , fronted by Chris Evans with support from Matt LeBlanc , Chris Harris , Eddie Jordan and former technology journalist Rory Reid . The new series is due to air on May 29 . Amazon reportedly paid £160 million for the presenters , a figure which Netflix said was 'not worth the money ' . The Grand Tour will be released this autumn on Amazon Prime , but an exact release schedule has yet to be announced .

Amazon has announced a service called Amazon Video Direct , which allows filmmakers and content creators to self-publish their work on Prime Video . The service follows in the footsteps of its Kindle Direct Publishing , which has seen budding authors making their work available on Amazon 's store without the need for a publisher . Amazon Video Direct will be available to customers in the United States , United Kingdom , Germany , Austria and Japan . The service will compete with existing video distribution sites including Vimeo and Youtube . Amazon will distribute money based on customer 's engagement with the titles available on the service . These funds will be a share of a one million dollar monthly fund , and will be shared between the top 100 titles available on Video Direct . Content creators will need to make their content available to Amazon Prime customers to be eligible for this fund , which Amazon calls its AVD Stars programme . Content creators have the option of monetizing their content through Amazon by either offering their content supported by ads , as a rental or purchase item , or offering it as an add-on subscription through Amazon 's Streaming Partners Programme in the US . They can also make their content available for free to Prime members . Being able to monetize self-published video online is nothing new . YouTube already allows content creators to make money off the ads that people watch when viewing their videos , as well as their subscription service Youtube Red which offers users an ad-free experience . Vimeo also offers video on demand , which lets users rent and buy video content from its creators . Amazon is unique in that it already has a huge number of subscribers to its Prime service which content creators can reach by making their content available through Prime Video . This enrolls them in the previously mentioned AVD Stars Programme . Amazon also offers more monetization options than its competitors . At its launch , Amazon 's partners include The Guardian , Machinima and How Stuff Works , all publishers that have a large amount of content available on competing services such as YouTube .
Are you ethically against the use of real leather on your tech devices ? Bad news , you wo n't be able to buy the Amazon Kindle Oasis . The new Kindle Oasis comes bundled with a battery case , but it 's only available in real leather and Amazon has now told techradar that it has no intention of releasing any other choices for vegans or those against the use of real leather in products . An Amazon spokesperson told techradar , `` For customers looking for a non-leather , high-end alternative to Kindle Oasis , we recommend Kindle Voyage . `` There are a number of non-leather case options available for Kindle Voyage . '' Since the Oasis was announced , a petition for the company to release more pre-bundled case options has been launched . While this has only reached 569 signatures , this is a just-released product and it shows there 's an appetite out there among potential customers for Amazon to make its high-end new ereader more inclusive . Sara Farr , who started the Change.org petition , wrote , `` I want Amazon to offer a vegan cover option ( or even better make all covers vegan ! ) so we can all enjoy this new technology . '' The Kindle Oasis comes with a choice of either black , merlot or walnut colored battery cases – but it 's bundled in with the price of the product and there 's no way to purchase the ereader without the real leather case . Amazon has previously confirmed the Kindle Oasis covers will be available to purchase separately so you can mix and match the style of your ereader . But for those who are ethically against the buying real leather - even if it can be switched out - it looks like you 'll have to settle for the Kindle Voyage if you want a high-end ereader from Amazon .

If a new streaming service from Amazon sounds like music to your ears , you 're in luck – the Bellevue , Washington-based company might be on the verge of releasing a Spotify competitor . According to a report from Reuters , who cited two Amazon insiders , the company is eager to break into the music streaming space to compete with Apple Music , Google Play Music and Spotify . The sources say that it will be a standalone service and slightly different than the existing Amazon Prime Music service subscribers have access to today . The play here , it seems like , is to create a new service that will make the Amazon Echo , Amazon Tap and Amazon Dot speakers more appealing . Sources say that the service will cost $ 9.99 ( around £3.99/AU $ 14.99 ) and could launch as early as this fall . The idea of a recurring monthly subscription has been one that Amazon has adopted full bore – the company recently uncoupled Amazon Prime Instant Video streaming service from the annual subscription to the tune of $ 10.99 per month – therefore , it 's not a huge stretch to imagine the company has the same plan for Amazon Prime Music . At this point , however , it 's not totally clear what the service would be called or , more importantly , what exactly will happen to Amazon Prime Music . Clearly both services ca n't exist simultaneously , which means either current users will have to fork over an extra $ 11 per month for streaming music privileges or get grandfathered into this new plan . I 'm hoping for the latter .

Ever since the Amazon Echo first appeared , developers have been adding new abilities to Alexa , the voice-controlled AI service that runs on it . Now Amazon has confirmed Alexa has reached the milestone of 1,000 third-party `` skills '' . Amazon 's announcement is designed to get even more developers jumping on board with Alexa plug-ins of their own , but the roster of current talent is impressive : Domino 's , Fitbit and Uber are three of the well-known services you can access through Alexa . That means if you 've got an Echo installed at home , it 's possible to call up a pizza , your fitness statistics or a taxi using the power of your voice . Amazon has developed many different Alexa features itself , from web searches to weather forecasts . `` Today , we have a vibrant community of tens of thousands of developers who are learning about the service , bringing useful and innovative skills to every aspect of Alexa customers ' lives , and introducing their own users to the magic and simplicity of hands-free , voice-driven interactions , '' enthused Amazon 's Rob Pulciani via a press release . Alexa is spreading beyond the Echo too - it 's now also available through the Amazon Fire TV and was recently added to Pebble 's new Core fitness tracker . What 's more , the idea of the Amazon Echo tube has proved so popular that Google has copied it and Apple is rumoured to be planning to . With all the major tech players now having smart digital assistant platforms of their own , third-party integrations are going to be one of the ways that users can distinguish between them - it 's like the app store wars all over again . Check out our video review of Computex 2016 :

At this point Amazon has a sizeable selection of affordable tablets and it 's just added even more options to the range , but rather than giving us a whole new slate to play with it 's refreshed the big-screen Amazon Fire HD 10 . Now rather than a plastic finish you can get it in an all-metal silver aluminum shell and that still starts at US $ 229.99 , £169.99 ( roughly AU $ 319 ) , just like the white and black plastic options , which remain available too , even though we ca n't see why anyone would choose them over metal . The other change is an optional storage boost , with a 64GB model joining the pre-existing 16GB and 32GB versions . That sees the price rise to US $ 289.99 , £229.99 ( around AU $ 402 ) and is only available with the new all-metal model . The change in material should address our issues with the build of the Amazon Fire HD 10 , which we found to look cheap and unappealing , but that was n't the only problem the tablet faced , as while we praised its speakers and price , we found the screen and performance were n't up to scratch . That has n't changed with this new version , as other than the storage boost the specs remain the same , so you 're looking at a 10.1-inch 800 x 1280 screen , a 1.5GHz quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM . Still , for those invested in Amazon 's ecosystem it could be worth a look , as despite its problems it 's the company 's biggest slate and it 's just got a little bit better , though if you 've got the money to spare the Amazon Fire HDX 8.9 is a better option .

For the longest time , users have been frustrated with the absence of Amazon Prime Video on Apple TV and Google Chromecast . Rival Netflix can be found on both devices , but Amazon 's streaming service has been notably absent , and the Amazon stopped stocking both devices in October last year . According to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos speaking at Recode 's Code Conference , the decision to keep Prime off these devices is to do with the absence of `` acceptable business terms . '' Bezos refused to respond to a follow up question about whether these `` acceptable business terms '' referred to the 30 % cut that Apple takes from all purchases made through its devices . At the time of the decision it was speculated that the decision was due to Apple and Google offering hardware that competed with Amazon 's Fire TV set-top boxes and streaming sticks . By keeping Amazon Prime Video off its competitors ' devices , Amazon was thought to be working to push consumers towards its own devices . The use of the phrase `` acceptable business terms '' however implies that the disagreement is bigger than just this competition . Amazon Prime Video continues to be available on Roku boxes which are still sold through Amazon 's store . Meanwhile searching for either Chromecast or Apple TV brings up Amazon 's own Fire TV devices . Via The Verge

The world of patents is always an interesting one to peer into - they can often reveal clues about some of the ideas companies are kicking around before they 're prepared to make those ideas public . In that spirit we present to you some new patents filed by Apple and spotted by CNN : noise-cancelling headphones that will automatically respond to certain sounds , like a car horn , or an emergency siren , or someone shouting out your name . If it sounds like you 're in danger , the headphones will let the sounds of the real world back in , potentially saving you from a life-threatening situation . Microphones embedded in the cans listen out for key sounds - just like your iPhone listens out for `` hey Siri '' . Amazon does n't make any headphones right now , but CNET reports that the Amazon engineers who 've filed the patent have previously worked on the Alexa AI that helps power the Amazon Echo . It 's possible that Amazon wants to expand its hardware empire or perhaps it 's looking to introduce this kind of smart listening functionality to its existing devices . Patents do n't always develop into fully fledged products so it might be some years before we see something like this ( if we ever do ) . The patent is clearly designed to combat the growing problem of digital distraction : focusing so much attention on our phones and the entertainment they offer that we miss what 's going on in the real world . Now where are those Pokémon ? Here 's our review of the Amazon Fire TV :

Amazon is to start trialing its drone delivery service in the UK , after being granted the approval of the government to carry out tests without some of the usual flying restrictions . The retailer giant was granted permission by a cross-government team , supported by the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) , to test drones without being shackled to existing rules that govern the use of remote-controlled aircraft . Amazon will be able to fly drones beyond the line of sight in both rural and suburban areas ; test the drones ' ability to avoid obstacles ; and test-fly fleets of autonomous drones overseen by one person . Not only will this give Amazon more leeway to test its miniature delivery aircraft , the findings will help inform future policy on the safe use of drones . Paul Misener , Amazon 's Vice President of Global Innovation Policy and Communications , said : `` This announcement strengthens our partnership with the UK and brings Amazon closer to our goal of using drones to safely deliver parcels in 30 minutes to customers in the UK and elsewhere around the world . '' Earlier this year Amazon said that there would be a time limit of 30 minutes put on all drone deliveries , which can not exceed an upper weight of 55 pounds .

Tech companies are having a good run . Thanks to the internet , which is now used by over three billion people , the reach of Facebook , Twitter , Amazon , and so on seems endless . A teenager today can find information on a range of topics that would , just 20 or so years ago , have required multiple trips to multiple libraries – and they can do it instantly . The internet-connected world is set to change rapidly , as the abundance of information – based , in part , on crowd-sourced knowledge – spreads exponentially . That is n't to say that tech companies are impenetrable , of course . Many have their own flaws and weaknesses , including competition , changing macro trends , or something else entirely . In this article , we are going to examine the major challenges facing these firms , starting with a certain iPhone peddler… It may seem strange that the most valuable technology company in the world ( current market value : $ 547 billion , which is around £415 billion , AU $ 730 billion ) would be facing difficulties , but there are signs that Apple 's dominant position may be under threat . The iPhone , which is one of the most successful products ever raking in countless billions in revenue every year , has long dominated high-end smartphone sales , but as more people buy premium smartphones the addressable market – i.e . the people who have n't got one – becomes smaller . Growth in China , where the middle class is expanding rapidly , has dropped off a little , which is making investors nervous . Apple has recently been touting its software and services business – the subscription stuff that comes with an iPhone – as an alternative path , but it remains to be seen if that can compensate for the slowdown in phone sales . Microsoft is a dominant force for many users when it comes to Windows , Office , and so on – but only on a PC at work . A near-catastrophic failure to enter the smartphone market in any meaningful way has left Microsoft out in the cold when it comes to the devices consumers use most , which has degraded its market position and influence substantially . Changes by Satya Nadella , the third CEO of the company in 40 years , have yielded some progress and the online services division , which includes Office 365 , is promising . The biggest problem that Microsoft faces is what course it should take next . Does it , for example , retreat to an enterprise-only entity that licenses computing power to other companies ? Or will Windows 10 , which has over 350 million active users , help it remain relevant inside the home ? Microsoft recently backed away from its goal of one billion Windows 10 devices by 2018 – thanks , the company says , to a focus on mobile – and this only stands to reinforce the idea that , for consumers outside the workplace , Microsoft is no longer relevant . Amazon is hot stuff at the minute , thanks to its Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) division and massive e-commerce business . The company has crushed its competitors online and is well on the way to taking over from Walmart as the foremost way of shopping in the US . Of all the companies on this list , Amazon is in the strongest position insofar as it dominates almost every market it enters : e-commerce , cloud services , e-readers , and so on . But there are areas that could be improved , such as online multimedia , and complacency from being at the top could force an error . Microsoft , and smaller companies like Box , are champing at the bit when it comes to cloud services , and Amazon could become a victim of the same internet-based 'disruption ' that it rained down on bricks-and-mortar retailers . Google , one of the original internet giants , is in an odd position . For a decade or so it was the undisputed king of the internet and , because of that , advertisers pumped endless dollars into the firm . These days , however , Google is suffering from issues on multiple fronts . Facebook is cutting ( deeply ) into Google 's revenue streams as the social network emerges as a compelling way of reaching a large online audience . Google was also slow to monetise its online platform for mobile . This was , in part , thanks to Apple 's dominance of high-end mobile phones and its subsequent unshackling from Google services , including search . The company still has Android , of course , but the most affluent – and thus desirable – users own an iPhone . Cloud services are another area in which Google is struggling , despite being one of the first cloud companies . Amazon has essentially done what Google should have , and Microsoft owns the lion 's share of the most lucrative deals , leaving the search giant with little else . Google still has a long runway before bad things start happening , but the rosy situation the company found itself in pre-2010 is no longer a reality . Twitter , like Google , is a victim of Facebook 's success and the unwillingness of advertisers to spread cash to a much smaller social network . User growth for Twitter has stalled at around 310 million users per month worldwide , which may seem impressive but pales into comparison when you consider that over one billion people use Facebook every day . ( The comparative daily use figure for Twitter , while unconfirmed , reportedly sits at around 150 million . ) Product innovation has also stalled at Twitter , which often leads from the front with new ideas and products – live streaming ( Periscope ) , short videos ( Vine ) , real-time breaking news ( on Twitter itself ) – only to be surpassed by Facebook , which leverages its massive user base to muscle out its smaller rival . Harassment is also an issue for Twitter , which has been slow to deal with reports of offensive comments towards women , minorities , and so forth , which have led many to consider the network a hostile environment that is n't worth bothering with . The combination of issues – Facebook 's dominance , a slow product development cadence , and problems with trolling and harassment – present Twitter with a series of high-level flaws that have not yet been fixed , despite many statements by top executives about imminent changes . Intel has been around for a long time and is responsible for a lot of innovation that has happened in the tech world thanks to its founders – one of whom thought up Moore 's Law . Times have changed , however , and Intel missed out on the mobile revolution which has seen PCs become far less relevant to the everyday consumer when compared to a smartphone . Qualcomm , a newer rival to Intel , positioned itself quickly and effectively as the go-to maker of smartphone chips , and Apple develops the iPhone 's processor in-house , which left Intel bereft of billions in potential revenue . Intel recently shifted its focus to work on Internet of Things devices , which are an emerging market that could pay dividends – if the IoT matches expectations over the next few years . But the loss of smartphone revenue has left the company in a tricky position that would have been impossible 10 or 20 years ago . Yahoo , which is the oldest internet giant , has gone through a rough patch in recent times – by which we mean the past 10 years – as social networks surpassed it as the main way to access consumer news and other media . The homepage , which more closely resembles a newspaper than Facebook 's timeline , is still visited by around a billion people per month , but advertisers are moving towards the social networks to invest , leaving Yahoo short . Deals to make Yahoo into a technology company , which receive a higher valuation from investors compared to media companies , have remained unsuccessful and multiple acquisitions of startups – including Tumblr – have failed to drive relevance or growth . The company recently put itself up for sale , with bidders reportedly including Verizon and some private equity firms . The outcome of any impending deal is of course not known , but will most likely relegate the company to a position within a conglomerate that is bundled with other media outlets . Having a homepage visited by over one billion people is , however , a definite asset , and a focus on this over the tech side of things – with the exception of Yahoo Mail , which is used by around 300 million people – could breathe new life into a failing giant .

Amazon Video just made a small tweak to its offline downloads that should give users more options when it comes to viewing content . Amazon has allowed you to download movies to watch offline since September last year , but until now users have been limited to storing these files on their phone or tablet 's internal storage . But now users will have the option of downloading movies and TV shows to their Android device 's SD card , which should make it a lot easier to download an entire season of a show without having to delete half of your installed apps first . Considering that most people keep their media on their device 's SD cards this move makes sense , and should help Amazon users make more effective use of their storage . It should also benefit anyone who 's limited by the size of their phone or tablet 's internal storage , with the maximum size of SD cards having exploded in recent years . Earlier this year Samsung announced the world 's largest microSD card , with 256 GB of storage – which should have the capacity to hold enough video for the longest of long plane rides . The feature is n't available for iOS , as iPhones do n't allow external storage cards to be used .

When Amazon first appeared , it rode the wave of e-commerce , tempting millions of consumers into buying goods online and having them delivered the next day . In those earlier days , there was no inkling that Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) would be a hit for the company . The basis of AWS , according to Brad Stone 's book 'The Everything Store ' , was to help internal Amazon teams to host apps , files , and so on . The actual idea for growing it beyond that was not thought of for some time and , at least initially , was viewed sceptically by senior management . While Amazon blazed the trail in terms of online retail , back then , its tech credentials were – at least to the outside world – not on the same level as Google or other made-for-the-internet giants . The decision to try and make a go of Amazon Web Services , though , turned out to be a masterstroke by CEO Jeff Bezos who , Stone writes , is responsible for most high-level decision-making within the company . According to company filings and various analyst projections , AWS is a monsterthat is growing faster than even the company can comprehend . `` Amazon 's introduction of Amazon Web Services in 2006 marked the launch of a notable shift in the market for outsourced enterprise computing , '' wrote Gartner , a leading research firm , in a report . `` As a result , IT vendors of all kinds … have all felt significant impacts on their businesses , and many are now quickly adjusting their product strategies to deal with the new market landscape . '' In the fourth quarter of 2015 , AWS generated over $ 2.5 billion ( around £1.9 billion , AU $ 3.4 billion ) in revenue , of which over $ 650 million ( around £500 million , AU $ 870 million ) was profit . These figures are up over 50 % from the previous year . Amazon is notoriously a company that is extremely tight on profits , seeking out every last dollar to spend on investment . Ben Thompson , an independent analyst at Stratechery , argued in a note that : `` AWS is simply spinning off more cash than Amazon knows what to do with . '' The company 's new division , which has existed for 10 years , is just too profitable . Indeed , Amazon 's recent quarter-to-quarter results have been unusually profitable for the company . The firm announced in its Q1 2016 report , which covers the three months leading up to April , that its net income was $ 513 million ( around £395 million , AU $ 685 million ) , up from a loss of $ 57 million ( around £44 million , AU $ 76 million ) in the previous year . It 's clear from this that AWS is a monster business that could , in the future , overtake its retail counterpart . `` If , in the long run , Amazon shifts from being an e-commerce company with a cloud services business on the side to a cloud services company with an e-commerce business on the side , then their potential as a money-making entity should shift dramatically as well , '' says Thompson . It 's hard to see from this perspective that Amazon would need to do anything differently , especially as the addressable market for cloud services is virtually infinite as more and more companies of all sizes move online .

Update : Since publication Amazon has clarified this deal is only for US subscribers to Amazon Prime . Original : Amazon Prime Video is about to become the exclusive place to stream 33 Warner Bros. movies , thanks to a new deal between the two companies . According to Variety a selection of movies including Space Jam , Twister and Oceans Eleven have already landed on the service for US customers , with others such as The Matrix trilogy and the four Lethal Weapon movies set to come later in the year . Other movies joining throughout 2016 include Caddyshack , Full Metal Jacket and You 've Got Mail . We 've asked Amazon whether UK subscribers will enjoy the same lineup of films in 2016 , and we 'll update when we know more . Inking this deal with Warner Bros. means Amazon is seriously taking the fight to streaming rival Netflix . To date Amazon 's Video library has been fair but certainly not as strong as Netflix 's , which continues to not only land big titles but build momentum with its own `` Original '' exclusive shows and movies . Amazon currently has the advantage of offline viewing , letting you download movies and shows and watch them without a connection . Netflix has told us on more than one occasion that it has no plans to introduce a similar feature , but there 's reason to believe that might soon change ...

Sonos , makers of internet-connected speakers , announced today that it 's opening up its platform to Spotify and Amazon . Sonos said you 'll finally be able to control your tunes directly in the Spotify app . You can still use the Sonos app to control your tunes , of course , but having playback support inside the app makes it easy for your friends and family to take turns DJing . Let 's be honest , no one 's going to download the Sonos app just to play their tunes on your Sonos speakers . Sonos support for Spotify Connect will be available in a few weeks , and will let you control individual speakers . The feature works similarly to Chromecast Audio , where all of your connected speakers show up in a list . With Google Cast becoming integrated into many TVs and speaker systems , it 's surprising Sonos did n't open up its platform sooner . Google 's media streaming solution makes it easy for anyone to cast media to various speakers and TVs from within popular apps like Spotify , YouTube , Soundcloud and more . In addition to Spotify Connect support , Sonos revealed it 's partnering with Amazon to add Echo support next year . This means you 'll finally be able to use voice to control your Sonos speakers . Check out how it works in the video below : Alexa , Amazon 's virtual assistant , will be able to tap into either Spotify , Amazon Music or another supported music service to stream music . You 'll be able to control playback via voice , and you can even ask Alexa questions about what 's playing . `` Our mission is to fill every home with music , '' said Sonos President Patrick Spence . `` We do n't care what you listen to , how you get to it , or in what room – we just want it to be effortless , quick and epic . Alexa on Sonos will be all that , and fun too . '' Supported devices include the Amazon Echo , Echo Dot , Tap and Fire TV products . There will be a invite-only beta test later this year with the final release coming to everyone in 2017 .

Here 's another thing to add to the list of problems that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update has caused : the Kindle Paperwhite and some other models are reportedly causing PCs to lock up when the device is plugged into a USB port . Yes , it would seem that Microsoft has another fire to fight here , with another thread springing up on the company 's Answers.com forum full of Kindle users who are complaining about the issue which is causing a blue screen of death when Amazon 's hardware is connected to their computer since the Anniversary Update . Most folks are complaining about the Paperwhite , but there are also users saying the same thing is happening with other models such as the Oasis and Voyage . The crash seems to be a rather flaky one in that it 's happening to some folks and not others , and various workarounds have been suggested , but not all of them seem to work for everyone . Some claim that the BSOD only happens when you plug the Kindle into a USB 3.0 port , and not a USB 2.0 port – so if you 're suffering at the hands of this bugbear , you might want to try using the latter . Others have suggested that plugging in the Kindle before the computer boots up avoids the crash , or indeed plugging it in while your laptop is sleeping . Of course , it 's worth giving all these potential solutions a whirl , and hopefully you 'll find something works until Microsoft gets round to patching this problem – apparently this is a driver issue on Redmond 's side . The list of problems caused by the Anniversary Update also includes PCs freezing up in general , Cortana disappearing , and webcams getting broken . Via : The Register

Rumors about Amazon launching a standalone music streaming service have been circulating for some time , but until now we 've assumed that the service would take a similar form to its competitors such as Spotify or Tidal . Industry sources speaking to Recode have indicated that Amazon might be about to bring something new to the music-streaming table . In addition to the industry-standard $ 10/£10 tier , these sources are reporting that Amazon intends to launch an additional tier at half the monthly price . The catch ? The tier will only allow you to listen to music through your Amazon Echo speaker . That means no desktop version , but more importantly , it means no mobile listening either . This raises the question of whether this means we 're about to see the Echo launched outside of the US . If the voice-activated speaker is going to be a core part of Amazon 's music streaming service , then it makes sense for it to get a wider release than just the USA . Amazon currently already operates Amazon Prime music , but in order for it to compete with the likes of Spotify and Tidal Amazon would need to significantly increase the quantity of music on the service , as well as untethering it from the annual Amazon Prime subscription , as it has already done so with Amazon Prime Video . We have contacted Amazon for comment on these rumors and will update this piece with its response . Via Recode
One of the least enjoyable parts of buying a car is trekking to a dealership - usually late after work or on a weekend when you 'd rather be anywhere else - and spending hours behind the wheel with a pushy salesperson ( at least , that 's been our car-buying experience ) . Amazon , in partnership with Hyundai , is looking to change all that , delivering test drives to some potential car buyers wherever they are . A new program called `` Prime Now . Drive Now '' is letting people schedule a spin with a 2017 Hyundai Elantra through Amazon 's same-day delivery service . The car will meet them anywhere ( home , work , Starbucks ) at a set time between 9am and 7pm , and folks can take it on a 45- to 60-minute test drive . If they want to finalize a purchase , they 'll be pointed toward their local Hyundai dealership . Hyundai is calling the program a `` tailored test-drive experience , '' and it certainly brings one of the most crucial parts of buying a car to customers , rather than the other way around . There are several restrictions to `` Prime Now . Drive Now . '' It only runs for two weekends , and having kicked off August 20 , this coming weekend is the last time drivers can take advantage of the offer . What 's more , it 's only being offered in Los Angeles/Orange County in the US . Even if it were to expand , Prime Now is n't available world or even nationwide , yet , though its 25 metropolitan markets is still a sizeable number . Limited as it is , the potential of booking a test drive - and more - through Amazon is astounding . It could revolutionize the car-buying experience if more car makers sign up ; imagine never having to go to a dealership again and scheduling a test drive just as you would order an item on Amazon . And why stop at short spins around the neighborhood ? Why not let people make car purchases through their Amazon Prime memberships , too ? One clue Amazon is only looking to do more with cars is the recent integration of Alexa , its voice-powered assistant , with the Genesis G80 and G90 . Drivers can perform a number of tasks in-car thanks to Alexa . We 've asked Amazon if the Hyundai partnership is the first of many test drive offers , and whether it sees a future where Prime members could make other auto-related purchases in the future , including one day buying a car . We 'll update this story if we hear back . Until then , if anyone in LA wants to take us for a spin during their `` Prime Now . Drive Now '' test drive , drop us a line .

Look out , world - Amazon 's Alexa is about to start controlling cars . Genesis Motors has just become the first automaker to launch an Amazon Alexa Skill , enabling the Echo , Dot , and Tap to send remote commands to the G80 and G90 sedans . We 've seen cars talk to homes , enabling motorists to trigger their Nest thermostat during their evening commute , but this process works in reverse . While inside the home , G80 and G90 owners can ask Alexa to start their car 's engine , adjust the cabin temperature , lock/unlock the doors , and trigger the horn/lights . The new feature is being bundled into Genesis Connected Services ( which is its terminology for Hyundai Blue Link ) , and we 're assuming that the commands you see above are just the beginning . To boot , those who splurge on a G90 will receive an Amazon.com gift card to purchase an Echo , giving you no excuse for not taking advantage . To get things going , you 'll need to enable the Genesis skill within the Alexa app ( available on iOS , Android , and Fire tablets ) , and then link your existing Genesis Connected Services Account within the aforementioned app . And that , folks , is the future unfolding in front of your eyes .

Google is a pretty old company compared to most internet giants . Facebook , which now connects over 1.6 billion people every month , was founded in 2004 . Twitter , where most breaking news happens , was founded in 2006 . LinkedIn , the social media outlet for the world of work , was founded in 2003 . Google , on the other hand , was founded in 1998 . The internet is what made Google into the behemoth it is today . Billions of people visit its search engine every week , billions more use Android , and – if everything goes to plan – Google 's 'moonshot ' projects will be used by billions more also . Alphabet is the company that controls Google and said moonshots , which include Google Capital ( not related to the search engine ) , Verify ( a health and medical research company ) , Google Fibre , Calico ( a biotech research company ) , and many more . The parent company was created as a way to help Google investors understand the other portions of its business that are n't related to search advertising , where it derives billions of dollars in revenue every quarter . Back in 1998 , Google was a search engine that trumped its rivals – including big companies like AOL and Yahoo – by indexing the web more effectively , drawing the best results to the top . Indexing these pages , which revolves around the process of seeing how many in- or out-links there are , requires a lot of computing power which made Google one of the first large-scale cloud computing businesses . Google currently has 15 major data centres located around the world , in places ranging from Jackson County , Alabama , through Eemshaven , in the Netherlands , to Singapore . These centres are essentially banks of powerful computers humming away 24 hours per day , 7 days per week , to deliver searches , pictures , and information to billions of people . What these data centres also provide is the kind of processing power the company would need to run a more-than-successful , fully-featured cloud computing business . At present , Google is currently in third place when it comes to cloud computing . Amazon , a company many consider an online retailer , is top dog , and Microsoft is second , according to research firm Gartner , which regularly analyses the products released by the three companies . This outcome is surprising because Google has been doing cloud computing – the catch-all term for providing a heap of computing power remotely for intensive tasks before sending the data somewhere else – for longer than both Microsoft and Amazon , thanks to its primary business of search . Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s , Amazon was just getting started with and wanted to grow its e-commerce business , and Microsoft was fixated on getting Windows onto every PC in the world . Neither of these goals were related to the cloud in any particular way . Google , on the other hand , was starting to handle a high volume of queries about a huge range of topics , all of which had to be interpreted , the sites ranked , and the results returned in a fraction of a second . Over time , the algorithm has become more complex to cater for individual user needs based on the things they have searched for in the past and what that infers about them . 17 years of doing all of that – and more , especially after the launch of Android in 2008 – means that Google should be way ahead of its rivals in the cloud , but that is n't the case . In some ways , Google has been a victim of its success elsewhere . Android is now used on around two billion handsets and its search business competes directly with Facebook for around 80 % of the dollars spent on advertising online . These two success stories required big teams and commitment . The 'distraction ' , however , has cost Google a business that will generate Amazon around $ 10 billion in revenue next year , almost all of which is profit , thanks to the ever-decreasing price of hosting information on supercomputers . But that is n't to say Google is n't now trying .

While Amazon is working to get its delivery drones off the ground , it 's also launching its first branded cargo plane , the Amazon One . The Boeing 767-300 is part of Amazon expanding its `` air transportation network '' and improving delivery speeds for customers . The Amazon One will be joined by 39 other aircraft that Amazon is leasing from Atlas Air and ATSG . While Amazon already uses a group of planes for cargo , the Amazon One is the first of its new dedicated fleet . As you can see above , the plane is emblazoned with the Prime Air logo and the famous Amazon swoosh . According to Amazon , the new fleet will help it improve delivery times for its customers . Meanwhile the company is trying to get its drone delivery service running , which aims to deliver packages to customers using unmanned aerial vehicles . Those plans recently took a step forward with the UK Civil Aviation Authority granting the company permission to test its drones without being bound by usual flying restrictions . Meanwhile Amazon continues to clash with US regulators over testing Stateside .

When Amazon bought Twitch in 2014 , there were many throughout the gaming community who thought it could spell the end of the fun-loving streaming website . But , despite those fears , little actually changed . That was until today , when Amazon and Twitch announced a new service called Twitch Prime that might feel oddly familiar to Amazon Prime subscribers . The program was announced by Emmett Shear , CEO and Co-founder of Twitch , at TwitchCon 2016 's keynote held in San Diego , California . According to Shear , Twitch Prime is available for free to Amazon Prime subscribers will offer free games , free in-game content , one free channel subscription , exclusive discounts , release-day delivery on any game bought on Amazon and ad-free streaming through Twitch . `` We are now happy to bring you what we believe is the best deal for gamers , '' Shear said . The first game to be included in Twitch Prime is Streamline , a fast-paced multiplayer game built for broadcasters to play with their viewers , while Hearthstone players will get access to a new hero , Tyrande Whisperwind . Shear says that new games and in-game bonuses will be rotated in periodically , meaning that the program will share some commonalities with Sony 's PlayStation Plus and Microsoft 's Xbox Live Gold . To activate your Twitch Prime subscription as an existing Amazon Prime subscriber , all you need to do is link the two services together on twitchprime.com . Twitch Prime will be available starting today , and Twitch is offering a free 30-day trial of the service .
Coming to screens on November 18 , The Grand Tour is one of Amazon Prime 's most hotly anticipated exclusive shows . Reuniting ex-Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond , and James May for more car-based shenanigans the show has a ready-made audience behind it , making it an incredibly valuable addition to the Amazon Prime exclusive line up . However , according to a recent report from Business Insider , it might not be an Amazon Prime exclusive forever . Sources have apparently revealed that there 's a secret arrangement in place between Amazon and the ex-Top Gear team that will enable Amazon to sell the rights of the show to TV networks and broadcasters . As a result of this deal , Amazon is reportedly working with talent agency IMG to license second window rights to The Grand Tour . This is surprising news since it was n't so long ago that Amazon 's Jay Marine quashed rumors that the company may sub-license the show to an apparently very keen ITV , saying that Amazon had `` no interest '' in such a deal . Even if Amazon is working with IMG , there 's actually no guarantee that The Grand Tour will ever appear outside of Prime . This is because as part of this reported deal Amazon has the right to choose when , and even if , it wants to make the show available to regular channels after it 's aired to Prime customers . It could be possible that Amazon is working with IMG to only sell The Grand Tour to networks in countries where the Amazon Prime video service is n't currently available as the show does have significant global appeal . If this was the case , it would mean that Amazon would be able to get The Grand Tour to the widest possible audience , without undercutting the value of the Prime Video subscription for customers in the few countries where the service is currently available . Regardless , Amazon Prime customers can look forward to tuning into the show when it first airs on Amazon Prime in November .
It seems like you ca n't look anywhere these days without some company trying to replicate League of Legends or DOTA 2 's success . Character-based arena brawlers and shooters are everywhere . In 2016 year alone we saw For Honor , Battleborn and Overwatch , and we 'll soon get another with Gigantic coming later this year . But Breakaway , the first major release from Amazon Games Studios , is a completely different story . Announced at an event held the on the eve of TwitchCon , Breakaway might look like any one of those hero brawler clones – it 's a 4vs4 affair where one team tries to carry a relic from the mid-way point to the opposing team 's goal – but Amazon says it 's been built from the ground up for streamers , by streamers . Most of this is due to its tight integration with Lumberyard , Amazon 's in-house development engine – the two were developed simultaneously with an advance in one leading to an advance in the other . We 'll dive into what , exactly , this might mean for you as a player/voyeur in a minute , but before we get to what makes Breakaway one of the most unique League of Legends offshoots ever made , let 's explore how it 's similar . The most apt description for Breakaway 's gameplay is `` Rocket League of Legends , '' a term that a handful of people at Amazon 's hands on event coined within minutes of seeing gameplay first-hand . The idea driving the game is a simple one : do n't get killed and do n't let the other team score . In itself this is no bad thing . The relatively small number of heroes are each distinct and well-defined , and using their abilities together adds to the metagame and overall strategy . On one end of the spectrum are attacking characters like Spartacus , a Roman gladiator who plays as a straight , no-holds-barred fighter who can leap into combat and rip a support character to shreds . On the other are support characters like Alona , a Mayan-esque priestess who can cast group heals and Morgan LeFay , a sorceress who casts damage-over-time and area effects . Patrick Gilmore , Studio Head at Amazon Game Studios Orange County explained , `` The core concept of this game was 'what would it be like to be a raiding party and steal something from somebody 's fortress ? ' '' The core concept of this game was 'what would it be like to be a raiding party and steal something from somebody 's fortress ? ' Part of this whole breaking in and raiding idea also involved what Gilmore calls 'buildables , ' which are essentially like something an engineer might build in Team Fortress 2 . The difference between Breakaway and Team Fortress , though , is that every character has the ability to build these structures , meaning that you 're not just balancing your offensive and defensive character abilities with the rest of your team , you 're also balancing the structures you 're assembling . For example , one of the characters , Rawlins , could build a mine cart that sent explosive barrels hurtling towards opponents and a small glowing switch that sprang into a caged prison when an enemy stepped on it . Another interesting difference are the settings Amazon Game Studios Orange County has chosen for the game – they 're all out of fables or mythology . The three levels announced so far include Atlantis , Styx and El Dorado , the latter of which was available to play at the event itself . On top of all this are items – which Gilmore says help you create `` a completely unique character and an emergent strategy on the fly '' . In between rounds you 're able to buy items using in-game currency acquired by assists , kills and scoring points . These items can boost defense or add extra health to your buildables . It 's an idea that 's been done to death by the hero brawler genre , so it 's no surprise to see it here . Similarly , the idea of buildables and fabled locations seems like interesting mechanics , but not groundbreaking in a way that completely separates Breakaway from the herd . However , where Breakaway really starts to stand out from the crowd is with its Twitch integration , which comes as a result of the streaming giant 's acquisition back in 2015 . Standing up on stage Mike Frazzini , VP of Games at Amazon , said that a core question that the team asked themselves was `` What would it mean if Twitch owned Amazon ? '' The result appears to have been a game that 's built from the ground up to be streamed as much as it is played . First off you have the Broadcaster Spotlight functionality , which allows a Twitch broadcaster to pick a player to be the focus of their stream . You could be playing a random match with a couple of friends , but if a popular Twitch streamer joins , they could have their thousands of viewers watching you directly . It 's a feature that 's at once compelling and yet utterly terrifying . Then you have Stream Plus , which allows viewers to place bets on certain match conditions . Given the recent controversy surrounding gambling in the Counter Strike streaming community , this announcement initially raised some alarm bells , but Gilmore was quick to allay any fears . `` When we built this system we wanted it to be about engaging with the broadcaster , and that 's why it 's a loyalty points system . It 's game specific , broadcaster specific ... so you wo n't be able to trade things in for material value , unless the broadcaster decides he wants to do that . '' What 's interesting is the way betting odds will be dynamically generated for each match . Initially any bet will have even odds , but the quantity of bets on any one outcome will skew it one way or the other . The caveat here , though , is that according to Gilmore the points will be specific to the streamer and to the broadcaster . Next up is Broadcaster Matchmaker , which allows a broadcaster to take control of which teams players are on in order to set up certain matches . Gilmore hypothesized that this could lead to mini-leagues cropping up between different broadcasters , `` There is this metagame that spans Breakaway and the Twitch experience where broadcasters are like team managers and can say to one another 'Hey , you have four teams and I have four teams – we 're going to set something up where we spend a week on our respective broadcasts working with our teams and then it 's all going to culminate in a tournament . ' '' Broadcasters are like team managers . Finally , Metastream gives broadcasters easy access to match data to aid in their commentary . Gilmore gave an example from the event 's livestream where one player had put all of his upgrade points into increasing the movement speed of his character . Using metastream , a broadcaster would be able to pull up that data , and use it to talk through the numbers directly with their viewers . It was n't clear how much of this functionality came from the Lumberyard engine and how much was game-specific , but when it comes to Breakaway , Gilmore gave the impression that the two are more or less inseparable . After all , Breakaway is the first game to utilise the Lumberyard engine , `` the first water through the pipes '' as Gilmore put it , and many of the features implemented in Lumberyard were done so in service of the game . We would n't be surprised to see similar levels of integration in future Lumberyard titles , but at any rate it 's clear that Breakaway has been designed to take advantage of every one of Lumberyard 's bells and whistles . With all this emphasis on unifying Amazon 's various products , we were curious as to whether the Fire TV set-top box had ever been a part of the discussion . After all , its arrival was preceded by a whole host of rumors that Amazon was about to launch a games console . `` We did talk about that [ the Fire TV ] , '' Gilmore explains , `` but our conversations were really around Twitch as the center of gravity ... Amazon is super customer centric , and so it just did n't make sense to say that we were going to drive hardware sales . That does n't benefit customers . What makes sense is working out where our customers are now , and how do we make games for them . '' On its own , Breakaway is a solid take on the character-based brawlers that have exploded in popularity in recent years . The capture-the-flag dynamics are fast and fluid , and the varied options presented by the buildables mechanic adds another layer of balance to team character choices . Where Breakaway gets really interesting is with the Twitch integration . The game feels almost inseparable from Amazon 's live-streaming service , and feels as though its every element has been constructed with that in mind . But all the Twitch integration in the world ca n't save a game that is n't fun at its core , and while it feels like Amazon is on the right track now , there 's still a long way to go before Breakaway 's eventual release . An alpha of the PC title is due to start this October , with an eventual release date to be confirmed . Amazon has yet to announce whether or not this will be a free-to-play game , but Gilmore mentioned that there was a gray area between free-to-play and a full release that he believed the game could explore .
Not content to be a leading online retailer , streaming service , e-book publisher , and grocery store , Amazon has finally unveiled its ambitious videogame publishing plans . The company announced the news on the eve of 2016 's TwitchCon , a convention surrounding the Amazon-owned live-streaming service . Three games were announced onstage : Crucible , a multiplayer first-person shooter ; New World , a game about constructing and exploring a shared world ; and a third-person multiplayer brawler Breakaway . After short teasers for the games , the event then focused on Breakaway , a team-based third-person multiplayer brawler which sees brawlers with different abilities facing off against one another . As well as different character-based abilities , the game also heavily integrates support for Twitch . For example , streamers can directly interact with match-making to build custom matches of viewers . We were told that Amazon hopes in the future this might lead to broadcasters coaching teams of players . The event also saw a 4v4 match of Breakaway played live on-stage , featuring a number of high-profile eSports players and Twitch streamers . The demonstration gave us a closer look at the different character classes , which include a typical selection of tanks , sharpshooters , and support characters . Each match is based around a central Relic , which is a capture-the-flag objective , but which can be can be thrown from player to player . Characters in the game are also able to build character specific 'buildables ' which offer both defensive and offensive abilities , and players can spend money between rounds on various character upgrades . Amazon did not announce which platforms the game would be on at this time but , based on the fact that the night 's exhibition match was played on PC , it 's fair to assume we 'll see it there . Breakaway is Amazon Game Studios Orange County 's first major title since its acquisition by Amazon in 2014 , and was known previously by the name Double Helix for its work on 2013 's Killer Instinct Reboot and Silent Hill : Homecoming . The acquisition fuelled speculation that Amazon was about to launch its own console , but when the Fire TV was eventually released in late 2014 the Android-based FireOS set-top box was more of a streaming than a gaming device , despite the ability to use a full controller with the device . The online retailer has build up a strong gaming portfolio . It acquired the gaming live-streaming service Twitch in 2015 , and also hired a number of leading developers including Kim Swift ( Portal ) and Clint Hocking ( Far Cry 2 ) , the latter of which left the studio last year . Amazon has also developed its own games engine Lumberyard , which is an open-source engine that is deeply integrated with Twitch and Amazon Web Services , the company 's cloud services division . Amazon has n't yet announced a release date for the game , however , it has announced that the game will be in closed alpha this weekend and accessible via a code distributed at TwitchCon .

It 's a good time to be a fan of streaming video . Roku announced a new line up of HDR/4K-ready boxes earlier this week and rumors are floating around about Google 's 4K Chromecast Ultra that it might show off next week . To top it all off , Amazon announced on Wednesday that it will update its Amazon Fire TV Stick with a quad-core processor , 802.11ac Wi-Fi antenna and Amazon 's voice assistant , Alexa , getting built straight into the remote . While the updates are more iterative on this year 's version of the Amazon Fire TV Stick than they have been in past years , Amazon says the upgrades will make the new hardware about 30 % faster than last year 's model . The best news by far , however , is that despite the additional hardware , the Amazon Fire TV Stick will stick to its $ 40/£35 ( around AU $ 50 ) price . The additional features , though subtle , are appreciated . A 30 % speed boost promises better loading times in between menus , while the 802.11ac antenna will mean consistent streams with less buffering time . The Stick still wo n't offer 4K or HDR , however . For that , you 'll have to shell out for the Streaming Stick 's older brother , the Amazon Fire TV , or wait to see if Google shows off the Chromecast Ultra next week at its October 4 press event . The new Amazon Streaming Stick with Alexa Remote starts shipping October 20 , and is available for pre-order starting today .

One of the best parts of owning an Amazon Echo is watching its virtual voice assistant , Alexa , mature with age . In the past year alone it 's learned what time restaurants close thanks to Yelp integration and can tap into Audible to read you a bedtime story . But Alexa 's latest leap forward – well , more of a stumble really – is something a little kid-friendly : Johnnie Walker Blended Scotch Whisky has teamed up with Amazon to develop a skill that will teach you about 150 years of whisky in a matter of minutes . The distillery released the skill today on the Amazon Echo Skills section of the Alexa app and besides general information about the different labels , the app can offer guided whisky tastings , dole out drink recipes and direct you to the closest location – hopefully within walking distance – where you can stock up on the libation . `` We 're delighted to be collaborating with an iconic brand like Johnnie Walker , '' said Rob Pulciani , Director , Amazon Alexa in a statement . `` The Johnnie Walker skill dives deep into the world of whisky in a fun and engaging way through recommendations of blends , practical whisky tips and more – all just by using your voice . Now our customers can entertain at home in a unique way with the hands-free convenience of Alexa . '' The Amazon skill is one part of the label 's digital mentorship program that encourages those who are unable to make it to one of the brand 's tasting rooms to learn more about the drink . The initiative also includes a Facebook Messenger bot that offers similar functionality . If you 're anything like me , although you probably do n't need any more encouragement to drink whisky , the idea of learning more while you drink from the comfort of your own home is a relatively good one ... at least until the hangover hits tomorrow morning .

Honestly , the words Home Theater PC are scary to a lot of cinephiles . Sure , they too want to watch content wherever they go without a subscription fee , but the idea of setting up and , worse , maintaining a media server is just too much for them . So in an effort to lower the barrier to entry , Plex is doing away with the whole `` you need your own media server '' thing thanks to a new partnership with Amazon : The two tech companies have teamed up to offer pre-built Plex storage servers to Plex Pass and Amazon Cloud subscribers . The service is called Plex Cloud , and it works like a regular local Plex server , except … well , all in the cloud . The servers are akin to Google Drive folders in the sense that you can store files on them and access them on any device , but differ in the sense that they 're specifically designed to show up on your Plex app . Load up the folder with content and you 're set to stream your favorite TV shows , movies and music on any device running the Plex app . Now , the caveat here is that you 'll need to either be an existing Amazon Cloud subscriber or sign up for the service ( to the tune of $ 60 per year ) in order to get in on the deal . Want Plex via your Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive account ? Unfortunately you might be waiting awhile . In a statement , Plex said `` We 'll continue to evaluate adding support for other cloud storage providers over time . '' Plex Cloud is going into beta starting today , and interested streamers can sign up for the service on Plex 's website .

Because having tens of millions of unique items for sale , a mail-by-drone service in the works , its own line of mobile devices , and an original TV streaming service still left some holes in its resume , Amazon just added a new service to its repertoire : photo printing . Enter Amazon Prints , an on-demand printer service where users can have photos , albums , calendars , and even stationary sent to their doorstep at the etail giant 's trademark competitive prices . Prints come in 4 x 6 , 5 x 7 , and 8 x 10 sizes , priced at $ 0.09 , $ 0.58 , and $ 1.79 each , respectively . Meanwhile , hardcover albums start at $ 19.99 and come in either glossy or matte page finishes , depending on what you think will make your pics 'pop ' more . Not only does Prints beat out the rates of long-time online printing source Shutterfly , but Amazon also plans to offer free shipping for a limited time on orders over $ 15 . There is one snag , though . Amazon Prints requires that the images be uploaded via Prime Photos , which comes as part of Amazon 's $ 99/year premium subscription service . If not , photos will have to be uploaded from Amazon Drive - another paid service that runs $ 59.99/year . This means taking advantage of Prints will require signing up for either an Amazon Prime or Amazon Drive subscription . Thankfully , the former features more than a fair share of other goodies , including free two-day shipping , unlimited music streaming , and access to Amazon Prime Video . Amazon Prints is currently only available in the US , according to TechCrunch , a limitation that should keep the free shipping promotion from getting out of hand . Still , it would n't surprise us if Amazon decides to expand Prints globally if the craze catches on .
Passed on Android Wear ? Not into the Apple Watch ? Maybe an Amazon Alexa powered smartwatch is more your style ? If so , check out the CoWatch , which has now gone on sale after being revealed earlier this year . It essentially puts many of the functions of an Amazon Echo into a wristwatch . Made by startup company iMCO , you can use the wearable to ask Amazon 's Alexa voice assistant for information including local weather , traffic news and sports scores . Alexa even has functionality beyond those standard smartwatch features , such as the ability to fill your Amazon basket via voice commands , control home automation products and even summon Uber rides . As the first Alexa-powered watch on the market , it 's certainly a unique selling point against its Android and Apple rivals . The watch itself looks pretty swish , too . Made with combinations of stainless steel and Zirconia Ceramics , it features a 400x 400 Super AMOLED display powered by a 1.2GHz dual core processor . 1GB of RAM is also squeezed in , with 8GB of internal storage . Water resistant with an accelerometer and heart rate sensor for fitness fanatics , iMCO is actually running the Alexa software on its own fork of Android Lollipop , rather than Google 's Android Wear OS . Called the Cronologics OS , it 's been specifically designed to handle Alexa-heavy interactions - but do n't expect to have access to all the Android or Android Wear apps you 'd expect with Google 's operating systems . It 'll be interesting to see how much long term support iMCO offer the OS . The success of the watch will probably determine that last point . Remember this device is also coming from an unproven startup as well , so we 'll have to get one on our wrists to know how good it really is . But if you fancy taking a punt on an intriguing new wristable , it 's on sale over at Amazon US right now in silver for $ 279 ( about £210 or AU $ 365 if directly converted ) and black for $ 299 ( £230/AU $ 390 ) . It 'll pair up with any Android phone running version 5.0 and above , or Apple devices on iOS 9 and up .

Let 's be clear for a moment . If Amazon wanted to buy eBay , it would have not one , not two , but three fights on its hands before even contemplating the purchase . The first would be with the US Federal Trade Commission 's own Bureau of Competition to clear the path for an acquisition . Amazon and eBay are two of the biggest online retailers in the country , although the surge of Walmart and the expansionist ambitions of Alibaba could change this in the long term . Then there 's the likely challenge involving its own shareholders ( although Bezos , with a sixth of the share , would be pulling the strings ) . eBay wo n't come cheap - expect the tab to reach tens of billions of dollars - and it 's a time where Amazon 's growth engine , Web Services , is on its way to becoming a sustainable multi billion dollar business with a fat 30 % margin . Finally , there 's the potential of a bidding war with an entity boasting very deep pockets . It would suit someone like arch-rival Alibaba or even Saudi Arabia 's newly-launched national investment fund . Still , Amazon 's market capitalisation stands at almost 10 times that of eBay at the time of writing , having seen its share price grown by more than 23 times over the past decade . We asked three industry experts about their views on the potentiality of such a deal and its impact . `` Without a doubt , Amazon is in every conversation in today 's retail world , '' said Rob Taylor , CEO and co-founder of online fulfillment specialist , Convey . `` Retailers are closely keeping an eye on Amazon 's every move and looking for a way to differentiate themselves against Amazon 's unique model – case in point , Wal-Mart 's recent acquisition of Jet.com . `` From an intelligent fulfillment point of view , if Amazon were to acquire eBay , it would bring Amazon one step closer to providing and delivering their customers a complete selection of products . `` At this point in time , eBay has the product offering to compete against Amazon , but has no equivalent of Amazon 's fulfillment capabilities , through an Amazon acquisition , eBay would fold into Amazon 's growing fulfillment fleet . `` For merchants , the unification of Amazon and eBay would lead to a connected experience , which would consequently lead to more consistent delivery experiences for consumers . '' Adrien Nussenbaum , co-founder of online marketplace startup Mirakl , says that such a deal would never happen . `` Amazon started trying out auctions and moved away from it to create the marketplace concept [ while ] eBay started with auctions and progressively moved to fixed price and some kind of integrated unified shopping cart , '' he said . `` These opposite paths lead to Amazon being way more successful than eBay . Besides eBay being very profitable on its historical business and Amazon being able to cut costs a lot , it is difficult to see an opportunity for synergy . `` In addition , if Amazon bought eBay , the FTC would likely block the transaction due to monopoly concerns . Beyond that , it 's an acquisition that does not make sense . It is not a win for Amazon customers , who have come to expect the high quality of service that Amazon delivers . `` eBay has more trouble with seller performance . It is not a win for sellers , who would lose a channel and become even more dependent on Amazon . And it is not a win for Amazon , which already has a hugely profitable Marketplace . `` That said , if it did happen , the challenge for Amazon would be continuing its reputation of great service by maintaining a high quality of service from its sellers . Amazon would certainly be opening up the door to even more competition as other retailers create Marketplaces to fill the void created by the loss of eBay . Wal-Mart would certainly up its efforts ( as it is already doing with the acquisition of Jet.com ) , but so would many others . '' Nussenbaum 's point of view was not shared by Andy Richley from ERP specialist Khaos Cloud , who sees plenty of opportunities in what could one day become the biggest tech deal ever . `` Well , the internet would self-implode , '' he said . `` But , more seriously , there are already plenty of synergies between the two companies . Just compare Amazon Vehicles and Ebay Motors , or the fact that both corporations are investing heavily in AI and Machine Learning . '' The biggest potential benefit could come from Amazon and Ebay being able to share best-practice and the latest technologies when it comes to integration . Amazon has brought cloud computing to a whole range of businesses , but its API that allows retailers to integrate with their Marketplace , FbA and other services is clunky . Ebay 's API is flexible and modern and allows retailers to integrate quickly and easily , but the company does n't have the cloud-computing solutions that Amazon can offer . The downside is that these companies currently learn from , and push , each other . Bringing them together could see that disappear and , eventually , lead to the organisation being overtaken by the next Amazon .

Amazon has announced that its brand new car series starring Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond , and James May will be launching on Amazon Prime video on November 18 . Called The Grand Tour , the series will see the ex-Top Gear trio travelling the world to take part in a variety of car-focussed adventures , with additional segments filmed in front of live studio audiences , the first of which is in California . Sound familiar ? It 's format that will appeal to fans of the team 's Top Gear days , especially those who were particularly fond of the globe-trotting specials . From Friday November 18 , a new episode of the show will air every week and Amazon Prime customers will be able to tune in via the Amazon Video app for TVs , connected devices including Fire TV , mobile devices and online at www.amazon.com/thegrandtour . Jay Marine , Vice President of Amazon Prime Video EU said `` Customers have been desperate to find out when they can watch their favorite team back on screen '' going onto say that `` The guys have been having a blast filming the show around the world . '' Let 's hope everyone has as much of a blast watching them since they 've committed to filming three series of the show already .

The last time we went shopping on Amazon , we bought a reading lamp , a book and sunglasses . If we 'd waited till today to make our purchases , we could have thrown in an HTC Vive for good measure . The headset is the latest viewer to expand availability to the giant online etailer , opening up yet another avenue for the US public to get a taste of VR . It 's also a sign Amazon probably wo n't be getting into the VR headset business on its own any time soon - sorry , Fire VR hopefuls . Oculus Rift has been available through Amazon for a few months now , and while you 'll see the Sony PlayStation VR listed , you ca n't actually buy the headset or a bundle as pre-orders were lapped up within minutes of going live . The Samsung Galaxy Gear VR is also up for order , if mobile VR is more your thing . The HTC Vive , at least for now , is in stock on Amazon and ready to ship . The whole system includes the headset , two wireless controllers and two sensor arrays . At $ 799 , the Vive is more expensive than the $ 599 Oculus Rift , though that did n't stop us from deeming HTC 's offering the unequivocal winner in the current VR war . If shopping on Amazon is n't your favorite way to get new gadgets , you can also pick up an HTC Vive through select Microsoft Stores , GameStop and Micro Center stores , or online through vive.com , Microsoft , GameStop , Micro Center and Newegg . Now that Vive is available on Amazon , will you be taking the VR plunge ?

If you 've always felt like Twitter needed more in the way of voice control and response , good news : the platform has announced its very own Amazon Alexa skill , which means the digital assistant app can read out trends , tweets , notifications and more for you . Alexa originally appeared on the Amazon Echo but is starting to spread to more platforms and devices , including the latest set of tablets from the online retail giant . If you 've got an Echo at home you do n't need to lift a finger to find out who 's been @ replying you . While Twitter has n't published a full list of commands , they seem to be pretty straightforward : `` Alexa , ask Twitter has anyone retweeted me ? '' and `` Alexa , ask Twitter for my mentions ? '' are two of the inputs available to you . You can also look up trends across Twitter as a whole or for a specific area , and get the latest tweets from your timeline by saying `` Alexa , ask Twitter what is happening ? '' It does n't look like you can send tweets through your Echo yet though . Those of you outside the US could be getting your hands on Echo speakers very soon , as Amazon is expected to announce UK availability on 14 September at a special press event in London . When it turns up , there 'll be a new Alexa skill on offer . Earlier this year Amazon announced there are more than 1,000 skills ( sets of voice commands ) available through Alexa , although their quality varies : you can use your Echo to do everything from get the weather forecast to order an Uber .

Amazon is allegedly looking into streaming live sports to take down traditional cable subscriptions and Netflix . That 's the word coming from Bloomberg , citing `` people with knowledge of the matter . '' Amazon is reportedly seeking streaming rights to sports that would appeal to a global audience , including tennis , golf , soccer and car racing . `` Amazon has been leaning forward on sports , '' Tennis Channel Chief Executive Officer Ken Solomon tells the publication . `` They want to be a new age [ multiple-system operator ] . '' Solomon claims his network has been in discussions with Amazon over streaming rights for over a year . If the etailer is successful in obtaining streaming rights to sports , it could give its Prime on-demand video service a huge leg up on competition like Netflix , which currently has no interest in the field . Right now , the only way to watch live sports is to do so over the air , with a cable subscription or purchasing packages from sports organizations , like Major League Baseball . Amazon could theoretically offer sports streaming à la carte , as it already does for TV networks like Starz and CBS ' Showtime . À la carte streaming services are quickly becoming the industry norm - for example , HBO offers an internet-only subscription called HBO Now . Amazon already has its own eSports streaming service , Twitch , which has more than 100 million monthly unique users as of August 2016 . However , Twitch is facing increasing pressure from competitors like Facebook and YouTube Gaming . It will be an uphill battle for Amazon to obtain streaming rights for sports , which are the most expensive properties in media . For perspective , ESPN pays the National Football League nearly $ 2 billion a year for broadcasting rights . Amazon also recently lost a bid to stream Thursday Night Football games to Twitter .

Amazon has announced a refresh of the Fire HD 8 , with a vastly cheaper price and new innards , and it may be the first tablet in a while from the retail giant that 's worth picking up . The Fire HD 8 features an 8-inch display with a pixel resolution of 1280 x 800 , equalling 189 pixels per inch . The slate is powered by a quad-core 1.3GHz processor and 1.5GB of RAM . Amazon has doubled the storage from the last Fire HD 8 range to 16GB or 32GB – how much is available to use is unclear , but we 'd expect around 11GB on the smallest option . There 's also microSD support for cards up to 200GB , and a 4,750mAh battery . The tablet features front and rear cameras – we do n't yet have info on the specs for those – and Dolby Audio stereo speakers . The new Fire HD 8 runs the latest Fire OS 5 software , and you also get access to Amazon Underground , a separate store which only offers free apps and games that do n't include in-app payments . Design-wise the tablet is the same as the previous Fire HD 8 , with a rugged yet sleek feeling design ; the plastic back does n't scream premium though . Color-wise you 've got the choice of black , magenta , blue or tangerine . Pre-orders for the new Fire HD 8 are open now , with the 16GB version starting at $ 89.99 / £89.99 . That 's more than half the price of an iPad Mini 2 , the cheapest iOS tablet you can buy right now , and a similar price to the EE Harrier tab , which you can only buy in the UK . Shipping will begin on September 21 .

The Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick are getting a software update today that brings more powerful search features , fixing the platform 's most criticized features . Both Fire TV products have added over 75 new apps and channels to universal search . This means you do n't have to go digging in each app to find what you 're looking for . Instead , you can look up a topic or actor from the universal search and see all relevant results immediately . Today 's update also brings personalized recommendations for services like Netflix and HBO Go , and will eventually add the same for HBO Now and other apps . Subscribers to these services will see personalized recommendations directly in the Fire TV home screen for quick access to content . Amazon 's voice assistant , Alexa , also gets smarter with the update . You can now ask Alexa to skip or rewind any amount of time . For example , you can say `` Skip ahead 2 minutes '' to jump an episode 's intro , or you can say `` Rewind 30 seconds '' if you missed something . Last but not least , Amazon is adding the ability to check sports scores for your favorite teams from your Fire TV . Using Alexa , you can say `` give me my sports update '' to see the latest scores and game info . You can choose which teams to get updates from via settings in the Alexa app . These updates seem relatively minor but they help make the Fire TV products more compelling amidst tough competition from Roku , Google and Apple .

With the success of its Amazon Echo products and Alexa speech recognition technology , Amazon has become a somewhat unlikely leader in the voice activated assistant race . It 's now thought to be pushing into that space even harder , with rumors swirling that it 'll take on Microsoft 's Cortana on PCs . CNET is reporting that Amazon has held early-stage discussions with Lenovo to explore the feasibility of integrating Alexa voice controls in the company 's laptop line-up . The details are sparse at present – with the majority of PCs running Windows , it 's assumed that Alexa would act as a third-party alternative to Cortana , the Microsoft digital assistant built into Windows 10 by default . With Alexa already dominating the voice assistant space in US living rooms , receiving regular upgrades and third party home automation support , it 'd be an aggressively confident move to see Amazon taking on Microsoft on its own turf . We caught up with Lenovo 's Marketing , Customer/User Experience leader Dilip Bhatia at the IFA 2016 tech conference . While falling shy of confirming the rumor , he did note the impressive increase in voice control across computing devices , something that 's not gone unnoticed at Lenovo . `` Voice activation in general has caught on . People are using voice on their phones and they 're comfortable with it , '' said Bhatia . `` I see that voice activation will become part of mainstream computing in the near future , so there 's no reason why you ca n't talk to PCs in the future . That 's just the evolution of the PC . It 's no longer about the personal computer , but voice is a bit part of that - it 's around you . You 'll see more and more of that going forward . '' It 's a busy time for voice assistants . As well as Amazon 's Alexa , Google is preparing to push its Google Assistant , which will make its way into an Echo-rivaling Google Home product , while Siri is set to slide into macOS with the launch of the Sierra Mac operating system update .

If you 've bought a new charger for your Apple device from Amazon , you may want to double check that you 've not been sold a fake . According to a recent lawsuit filed by Apple , almost 90 percent of those sold through the site are counterfeit . Apple is paying particular attention to a company called Mobile Star LLC , which it is taking to court for trademark infringement . It claims that the company has been badging up dodgy cables and selling them through the online retail giant as though they 're genuine Cupertino wares . Apple 's engineers bought some listed as being `` shipped and sold from Amazon.com '' and , when examined , found them to be `` poorly constructed , with inferior or missing components , flawed design , and inadequate electrical insulation . '' In other words , the counterfeit cables are potentially dangerous . Apple bought more than 100 power devices masquerading as the real deal to support that 90 percent fake figure claim . `` Consumers , relying on Amazon.com 's reputation , have no reason to suspect the power products they purchased from Amazon.com are anything but genuine , '' reads an Apple statement . `` This is particularly true where , as here , the products are sold directly 'by Amazon.com ' as genuine Apple products using Apple 's own product marketing images . '' As a result of Apple 's investigation , Amazon is already said to have handed over the hooky stock that it bought from Mobile Star . But it 'll be worth going back through your Amazon receipts to make sure you 've not ended up with one of the potentially dangerous units . Via Patently Apple

As the 2016 US presidential election approaches its eventual conclusion , the time has come for American people to make a decision - but first , let 's consult Alexa . Amazon Echo 's digital assistant is acquiring a new skill courtesy of NBC News , granting the smart speaker the power to keep users up-to-date on election coverage before they head to voting booths in November . To get ongoing election news , candidate bios , delegate counts and more on your Amazon Echo or Amazon Fire TV , search for the NBC News Election skill through the official Amazon Alexa app . Alexa 's new ability is meant to help keep the public on the pulse of the presidential race , but it ca n't actually make the decision for them - when asked `` Who should I vote for ? , '' the AI responds politely with , `` Go with your gut , but inform your instincts first . '' We can only hope we 'll remain as calm and collected as Alexa during tonight 's final presidential debate . In the meantime , does Alexa 's pizza-ordering skill still work ... ? Via Engadget
We know that Amazon is keen on the idea of drones , and may one day use them to carry packages to our doorsteps , but a newly filed patent shows the company is thinking about miniature flying machines too . These tiny drones would be small enough to sit on your shoulder or fit in your pocket , the patent says , and a lot of the processing required by the devices would be offloaded to the cloud to keep them small and nippy . The patent includes a couple of interesting example use cases too : a drone zooming up to check on the length of a queue at your next music festival , or a police officer using one to tail a suspect in a chase . It sounds like the controls would be largely automatic and voice-driven - so you would tell the drone what you wanted it to do rather than fishing out a remote control . No doubt Amazon 's smart AI assistant Alexa is going to be involved somewhere down the line too . These pocket drones could be used to track down lost property , check where you parked at the shopping centre or even keep an eye on your kids if they 've got a tendency to wander off , Amazon says . As with any patent application , it 's only a sign of what a company is thinking about , and there 's no guarantee this will ever become a real product . Still , Alexa in a drone is an idea that has a certain appeal to it . Via GeekWire
You get a whole bunch of benefits when you sign up for Amazon Prime , from faster deliveries to video streaming , and the latest rumour is that broadband access is about to be added to the mix as well , at least for UK members . The tip comes courtesy of sources speaking to The Information , a site with a decent track record for business scoops . Apparently Amazon wants to rent network access from other Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) , something it can do in Britain but ca n't in the US . It would give Amazon an even more compelling subscription package and enable it to bundle internet access with video services , much like Sky or BT already do in the UK . Amazon itself has n't directly commented on the reports but it has a finger in some many pies it would be no surprise if it added another to the list . As yet there 's no timescale on when this might start rolling out . Germany , like the UK , allows wholesale access to its network - Amazon could potentially buy access off Deutsche Telekom and then sell a rebranded service on to customers . As we 've said , that 's much harder to do in the United States , as Google is finding . It would no doubt make Prime more compelling than ever but we 'll have to wait and see whether Amazon Prime Broadband becomes a real thing or just an idea that was once kicked around by Jeff Bezos and his executives .

Amazon is getting yet another feature to the Amazon Prime premium subscription , as its Prime Photos service is now making room for your family to share photos without having to buy multiple Prime accounts .

'' “ Prime members love the benefit of unlimited photo storage but often struggle to collect and organize photos across multiple devices and accounts into a single , shareable archive , ” said David Nenke , Director of Prime Photos . The Family Vault will come in also come in handy for those enjoying Amazon 's other recent addition : Amazon 's new on-demand print service , Amazon Prints , which can can forge prints , calendars , or even hardcover photo albums from a user 's Prime Photos collection . Prime Photos ' Family Vault is available now for Amazon Prime subscribers but , like Amazon Prints , the feature is currently only available in the US .

In 2015 Netflix and Amazon combined spent more on TV programming than HBO , Turner and CBS individually . The data comes courtesy of analysts IHS Technology , which also shows that the two streaming giants spent more money on content than Africa , South America and the Middle East combined . More than anything , the data shows the clear shift in power that ’ s occurring from traditional broadcast television to streaming . Both Amazon Prime and Netflix started by licensing and streaming films and the television content of traditional broadcasters , but in recent years the two have branched out into funding their own shows in an attempt to craft exclusives that can ’ t be found elsewhere . Netflix in particular has been bold in its movement towards original programming , and has recently stated that it ’ s aiming for 50 % of its content to be original . Both are still dwarfed by the likes of NBC and Disney , but if this rate of growth in streaming services continues then this won ’ t be the case for long .

That already low Amazon Fire HD 6 price just got even lower , as this ideal entry-level tablet gets special Amazon deal treatment today through Thursday . It 's a certified refurbished Amazon Fire HD 6 that now costs $ 44.99 , thanks to an exclusive TechRadar promo code : TECH11 . Entering this coupon code at checkout screen nets you an $ 11 savings on the currently affordable price . Normally , the Amazon Fire HD 6 with the same 8GB of internal storage costs $ 65.99 , though , Amazon says the original list price was as much as $ 99 . A refurbished unit brings it down to $ 55.99 every other day – but this is your lucky day , of course . Amazon lays out some ground rules , declaring that this soon-to-expire Fire HD 6 tablet deal is limited to one per customer and per account . Also , it spells out the expiration date and time for the promotional period : October 13 at 11:59pm PT . Our Amazon Fire HD 6 review gave the the tablet four out of five stars last year , and that 's when it was more than double the price . You 're getting 2015 specs , yes , but for a fraction of the price . That 's good perfectly fine if you 're looking for another window into watching Netflix , HBO Go or taking advantage of any other app among Amazon 's forked Android-based Fire OS ecosystem . Here are the terms and conditions spelled out by Amazon : Google 's big chance : Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL hands on review
It 's been a long time coming , but Amazon has finally revealed its standalone streaming service . Looking to rival Apple Music and Spotify in the over-the-air music streaming space , the newly-christened Amazon Music Unlimited will launch at a range of price points depending on how embedded you already are with Amazon 's other services . So , if you 're the owner of an Amazon Echo voice-activated speaker assistant , you can tap into the new streaming service for just $ 3.99 a month . If you 're a subscriber to Amazon 's Prime premium delivery service , it 'll set you back $ 7.99 a month , while everyone else pays $ 9.99 a month . Even at the upper end of the pricing tiers , that 's competitive with Apple and Spotify 's paid options . Pricing for territories outside the US ( where the service initially launches ) has yet to be set , but UK , Germany and Austria are expected to get Amazon Music Unlimited before the end of the year . So , what 's to separate Amazon Music Unlimited from the wide-ranging , established competition ? Primarily , Alexa integration . Amazon 's Alexa voice assistant will work seamlessly through the Amazon Echo speaker range to play any of the service 's millions of tracks from voice command prompts . You 'll be able to use commands like `` Alexa , play the song of the day '' to hear top tracks , or even more colloquial commands like `` play the King of Pop '' to get some Michael Jackson playing . Alexa integration separates this from Spotify and Apple Music . Over time , Alexa will learn your favorites and listening habits , making more accurate recommendations based on your taste . With iOS and Android apps supported , and major labels including Sony , Universal and Warner onboard , Amazon seems to have its bases covered - although it 's hugely possible that it does n't have the same size of library as Spotify and Apple , given it 's not explicitly stated as such . It 's worth noting too that Amazon 's existing Prime Music service , free as part of a Prime Subscription , will continue to be offered .

Amazon is reportedly planning to open brick-and-mortar convenience stores where customers can shop for perishables like milk and produce , further expanding its online retail business into the real world . Sources speaking with The Wall Street Journal point to Amazon building shops for customers to peruse , just as they would any other store , though with a select amount of inventory . There will reportedly be a way to order other goods , like peanut butter and cereal , through users ' phones or on touch screens placed inside the stores . These items would be delivered the same day , according to the report . But that 's not all for Amazon 's grocery games : the firm is also said to be planning designated drive-ins where shoppers can pick up an online order on the way home from work , for example . The groceries will be brought to their car , and Amazon , keen to minimize wait time , is reportedly developing license-plate reading tech to identify shoppers ' vehicles . The stores , codenamed Project Como , are n't for just anyone to waltz into when they want to restock their fridge , at least not for now . Only subscribers of Prime Fresh , Amazon 's grocery service that delivers items to customers in a set time period , will get to shop at them . Amazon is said to be primed to compete directly with grocery discount stores like Wal-Mart , netting customers who like to pick out their own food and bring groceries home . Despite a growing number of food-delivery services , online grocery shopping counts for a measly 2 % of US grocery sales , according to data gathered by the Wall Street Journal . The sector is expected to grow , however , and Amazon 's plans point to bringing some of the traditional grocery shopping experience to its modern-day delivery method , likely to make it even more appealing to customers . Competitor Google also offers a grocery delivery service with Google Express , and while it has a wide selection of goods from many top retailers , no plans for physical stores are known at this time . What 's more , Amazon likely wo n't stop at grocery stores : the report also points to the firm opening up locations where customers can try out its hardware , like the Amazon Echo , Echo Dot and Fire TV . There 's no word yet on where Amazon 's stores may pop up , but Fresh is currently limited to just over half a dozen cities . Reports point to Amazon opening its first grocery drive-in location in Seattle soon . What do you think - do Amazon 's stores stand a chance ? Let us know in the comments below .

Amazon 's Echo speaker has only just landed in the UK , but it 's already leaking snippets of hotly anticipated upcoming albums . Amazon usually provides 30-second previews of albums on its website , allowing users to preview tracks before committing to purchasing them . But with Lady Gaga 's upcoming album Joanne , previews of this hotly-anticipated album have been disabled . It would appear as though someone at Amazon had forgotten to disable them when it came to the company 's voice-activated Echo speaker , since users were able to request and then hear snippets of the new album . The BBC has reported that the incident was limited to the US , where the Echo speaker has been available for a couple of years now . If you 're looking forward to hearing clips from the new album , the loophole has unfortunately now been closed , but the BBC has a pretty exhaustive rundown of each of the tracks . Via : Engadget

Amazon 's rumored streaming music service may finally be ready . The service will go toe-to-toe against streaming music giants Apple Music and Spotify . According to an anonymous source `` close to the situation '' speaking with The Verge , Amazon is readying not one , but two music streaming services . The company will allegedly offer an on-demand streaming service for $ 10 ( £10 , AU $ 12 ) per month , similar to Apple Music , Google Play Music and Spotify . But there will also be a cheaper $ 5 ( about £5 , AU $ 6 ) per month streaming service for Echo owners , confirming previous rumors . Both subscriptions will allow access to Amazon 's library of millions of songs , but the cheaper Echo-only subscription will restrict playback to Amazon 's Echo products . With the more expensive $ 10 per month subscription , users will be able to stream from whatever device they want . The $ 5 per month Echo-only subscription may be worth it for those with a ton of Amazon Echo , Echo Dot and Echo Tap speakers in the home . But not being able to stream while in the car or on your phone is a major drawback . The Echo-only subscription will allegedly launch within the next few weeks , but the more expensive device-agnostic service may not come until the beginning of next year according to one of The Verge 's sources , though a holiday launch may still be possible . The service may be called Amazon Music Unlimited , according to a report from AFTnews , which spotted the name in Amazon 's new music app for the Fire TV . Note that Amazon Prime members will still have to shell out for the new subscription service , as it wo n't be bundled with the $ 99 per year Prime subscription . By offering a separate subscription service , non-Amazon Prime customers will have a lower cost of entry . Amazon pulled a similar move by offering its Amazon Prime Instant Video service for $ 11 per month , which can be purchased independent from a Prime subscription . Time will only tell if customers will leave their current music streaming services for Amazon 's . Apple Music has had success offering exclusive albums like Frank Ocean 's Blonde and Drake 's Views , and it 'll be interesting to see if Amazon can lock down some exclusives of its own .

Amazon Prime subscribers now have access to more than a thousand free books , comics and magazines Prime Reading is the latest addition to Amazon 's premium subscription service adds more than a thousand best-selling books with titles including The Hobbit , Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone , The Man In the High Castle , The Millionaire Next Door , Half Way Home and When I 'm Gone . Additionally , users will have access to electronic magazines such as Bon Appétit , National Geographic Traveler , People , Sports Illustrated , HGTV , Popular Mechanics , Golf Digest and Runner 's World .

A few of the shorts include Andy Borowitz , Stephen King , Jane Hirshfield and classic works from Gloria Steinem , Norman Mailer and Kurt Vonnegut . Amazon Prime already included one free pre-released book , but Prime Reading provides much more access to reading material for subscribers – putting it on par with Amazon 's unlimited video and music streaming service for select TV shows , movies and songs .

Amazon is taking steps to make sure its customers can completely trust its reviews by cracking down on those that have been written in exchange for free or discounted products . This change to Amazon 's community guidelines comes just a few weeks after Reviewmeta published research that showed customers who received a product for free or at a discounted rate were much more likely to review it positively The new guidelines say that customers will now be prohibited from `` creating , modifying , or posting content in exchange for compensation of any kind ( including free or discounted products ) or on behalf of anyone else . '' Under the old guidelines , customers were able to write reviews for products they had received for free or at a discount as long as they disclosed the fact . Now this wo n't be allowed at all unless it 's done for books or through the Amazon Vine program , which identifies and invites trusted and helpful reviewers on Amazon to post opinions about new and pre-release products This is n't the first step Amazon has taken to ensure reviews on the site are genuine , writing in a blog post that in the past year alone it has also introduced an algorithm that prioritised new , more helpful reviews ; making the criteria to qualify for the Amazon verified purchase badge more strict ; and suspending , banning , or even suing those it has found to be attempting to manipulate the review system . It 's important for online retailers like Amazon to have review sections that their customers can trust since the customer is unable to physically engage with a product in any other way before purchase . Although incentivized reviews that currently exist on the site wo n't be removed , stopping more appearing in the future should hopefully ensure that a product 's star rating on Amazon is an honest reflection of its quality .

`` Alexa , is there a new Amazon speaker with a 7-inch touchscreen on the way ? '' It 's doubtful your Alexa-powered machine will answer your query , but signs are pointing to a new , premium Amazon speaker making its debut as soon as early next year . A new report from Bloomberg says the retail giant plans to launch an Echo-like speaker with a screen stretching about seven inches . What 's more , the speaker will reportedly feature even better audio quality than what 's available on the Amazon Echo . The standout feature of the device would be , of course , its touchscreen . Amazon 's current line of smart speakers - the Echo , Amazon Echo Dot and Tap - lack displays . The screen , which will reportedly tilt upward to face users , will give them easier access to content , such as weather information and news , according to Bloomberg 's sources . Right now , Amazon 's speakers are primarily controlled through voice via its smart assistant , Alexa . Going up against competition like Google Home and a rumored Apple speaker that can sense your emotions , a display could help the new Amazon smart device stand out in an increasingly crowded market . In addition to a 7-inch touchscreen , the forthcoming ( though still unconfirmed ) device will apparently pack high-end speakers for better sound quality . The Amazon Echo has many good features , but its sound is surprisingly sub-par . Amazon appears to have taken that criticism to heart , plotting an audio upgrade for its next item . The product will be larger than the Amazon speakers we 've seen so far , as will its price , one source says . The Echo retails for $ 179.99 on Amazon , and it 's currently £119.99 on Amazon UK , down from £149.99 . Amazon did discount the Echo and its other speakers for Black Friday and Cyber Monday , suggesting it could have been clearing inventory before introducing a new product . We asked Amazon about the speaker , but were told the company does n't comment on rumors and speculation . The device could make its entrance as early as the first quarter of 2017 , so we do n't have much longer to wait before we see if this new gizmo comes to life , touchscreen and all .

You can still buy Beats headphones as one of the Black Friday deals in the US , even though we 're technically headed into Cyber Sunday in the Eastern time zone . The Beats Solo3 Wireless headphones are $ 80 on Amazon , costing a much more reasonable $ 219.99 . The Apple Store is still selling them for $ 299.99 right now , so this is a legitimate deal you wo n't find at every major store . What 's great about the Beats Solo 3 headphones are that they contain Apple 's new W1 chip that instantly pairs them with your iPhone 7 , iPad or Mac computer . No more spinning Bluetooth connect icon anymore . These headphones kind of make up for the fact that Apple axed the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus . The Beats Solo 3 are also among the most comfortable we 've ever tried . The Beats Solo3 are n't the only headphones with the new Apple W1 chip . The soon-to-be-released Apple AirPods include the wireless chip with the same instant connect capabilities . However , Apple has delayed the AirPods and has n't given us a new official release date for them just yet . You can also find the Beats Powerbeats3 wireless in-ear earbuds for $ 159 , when they normally cost $ 199 through Amazon . These are gym and run-friendly earbuds tethered to each other so you wo n't lose them , like you could with the Apple AirPods . The very same earbuds can be found for less without the awesome , but more costly W1 chip : the Powerbeats2 wireless in-ear eabuds for $ 89.99 also through Amazon . The headache of connecting them over the course of the next three years ( roughly how long we expect you to use these before upgrading to something newer ) is as low as $ 2.22 a month , so our recommendation is to spend the extra money if you can . Finally , you can backtrack to the Beats Solo2 headphones for $ 109.99 at Amazon . Again , it lacks the wireless chip here . All of this is a lot better than paying for the Beats Solo3 at full price . You 're a Black Friday and Cyber Sunday winner no matter which headphone deal you go with .

Google Cardboard is known for being the ultimate entry-level virtual reality ( VR ) headset at only £15 , but an Amazon Lightning Deal happening at the moment is beating even that . You may not have heard of it , but the AUKEY VR Headset is currently selling for £7.99 , 47 % off its RRP of £14.99 , which is a great opportunity for anyone looking for a cheap VR headset to keep the kids happy this Christmas . The headset is compatible with smartphones with screens from 4 to 5.5 inches , including popular iPhone and Samsung devices . You can watch films on an IMAX screen , and finally immerse yourself in all those 360 degree videos that have been popping up on social media . For £7.99 the headset looks reasonably sturdy – being made from ABS plastic it 'll be more durable than the Google Cardboard – and a well-placed ventilation point means you don ’ t have to worry about your phone overheating as you make your way through all that VR content you ’ ve been waiting to access . Hurry , though , as a Lightning Deal it 's limited stock only , and the headsets are being claimed fast .

The Amazon Echo is great for quickly getting small bits of information , playing songs , or listening to the radio , but we ’ ve also found it ’ s a useful accompaniment for cooks since it allows you to quickly set a timer without having to touch your phone with your grubby hands . While this timer functionality has certainly been helpful , we can ’ t help but think that Alexa has more to offer as a cooking aide . Now , a new Skill developed by the cookery website All Recipes is about to deliver on this promise , and will be able to talk you through entire recipes without you ever having to take your phone out of your pocket . The ‘ skill ’ , which is what Amazon ’ s taken to calling apps made for its smart assistant , allows you to search for recipes based on ingredients or recipe title , and you can also filter recipes by cook time . You can have the skill text ingredients to your phone before you head out to the shop , and it will also offer you step-by-step instructions while you ’ re cooking , giving you the information you need without having to get your phone ’ s screen covered in flour ( or meat , or water , or egg ) . However before you rush out and buy a bushel of Amazon Echo Dots , it seems that for now the skill is US-only . So far we haven ’ t been able to verify that the skill is available in the UK ’ s Alexa app , and all the recipes shown in the trailer appear to be American , with quantities given as volumes rather than weights for example . We ’ re hoping that the skill is successful enough for All Recipes to make it available worldwide in the future , but this raises an interesting question about how developers are able to monetize their Alexa skills . We have contacted Amazon for clarification on how developers are able to monetize their Alexa skills , and we ’ ve contacted All Recipes for more details on international availability of the skill .

Amazon is bringing its easy , online shopping experience to the car market , the company has announced - though for the time being it 's only going live in Italy , and you 're restricted to three Fiat Chrysler models . If you are an Italian with your eye on the Fiat Panda , the Fiat 500 , or the Fiat 500L , then you can simply click and buy . Amazon says it then contacts customers to ask them which dealership they 'd like to pick up their new motor from . It 's promising news for anyone who hates the thought of trawling round car dealerships looking for a good value deal - although at the moment it 's not exactly clear what kind of financial checks and processes you 'll need to go through to actually pay for the car . `` The time has arrived to give consumers a new , more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle , '' enthused Fiat Chrysler 's Gianluca Italia at a press conference . Online buyers will be eligible for some extra discounts too , the car maker says . The big question is whether countries outside of Italy will get the same facility in the near future , and Amazon has n't said either way . Obviously partnerships need to be struck and regulatory hurdles need to be overcome first . We 'll keep you posted about the potential expansion of Amazon Auto , but in the meantime the online retailer 's video service has a new car show you can start watching .

Hoping to power through your reading backlog this Thanksgiving weekend ? You may be interested in Barnes & Nobles ' newest Nook tablet , which comes out this Black Friday for an equally frugal cost of $ 49.99 . The Android-powered 7 '' Nook Tablet , set to debut November 25 , features a 1024 x 600 IPS display , 2MP front and 5MP rear cameras , 8GB of built-in storage , and can expand out to 128GB with a sold-separately microSD card - bravo to you if you can fill that much space out with just books , by the way . Barnes & Noble tells us that the 7 '' Nook Tablet will be US-only , though that may be for the best , as the company already discontinued selling Nook content for UK-based devices back in March , passing the buck to Sainsbury 's Entertainment - which in turn is discontinuing selling digital content itself this December . The upcoming Nook 's price is comfortably low , but not unchallenged . The Amazon Fire tablet matches its price at $ 49.99/£49.99 , alongside an amped-up HD version for $ 89.99/£89.99 . Should you not already be beholden to Amazon 's premium Prime service , the tie-breaker between the cheap e-books may simply come down to your preference in bookseller .

As Black Friday looms ever closer , thrifty shoppers are already putting their game plan together to snag the best deals the minute dessert ends on Thanksgiving . To that end , most of them probably already have Amazon Prime for early access to sales and free two-day shipping , but for those that do n't have Amazon 's premium tier , this Friday miiiight be the a good time to sign up . Amazon is offering $ 20 off a year-long subscription to Amazon Prime for one day only , reducing the cost for a year of Prime from $ 99 to $ 79 , starting November 18 at 12:00 am EST until 2:59 am EST on November 19 . The deal is being extended by Amazon to promote the November 18 debut of The Grand Tour - the Amazon Prime-exclusive spiritual successor to BBC 's Top Gear , starring Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond and James May . Amazon Prime 's unlimited music streaming , unlimited photo storage , free two-day shipping in the US , access to Amazon Prime Video , and special deals could come in handy for some this holiday , so follow this link on Friday if you want in . Time to talk limitations : The promotion only applies to non-Prime members , so it wo n't work on those re-upping their accounts for another year . It also wo n't qualify towards Amazon 's bounties program , which rewards cold , hard cash for converting customers to Prime , should you successfully pass the referral link to someone . For prospective Prime-ees who 'd prefer to take advantage of Amazon 's Prime-exclusive deals and expedited shipping this Black Friday without dropping $ 80- $ 100 , there 's always that free 30-day trial .

A Seattle court judge has ordered Amazon to organize a process for issuing refunds to parents whose children made in-app purchases without their permission . The issue dates back to 2014 , when the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) filed a lawsuit against the retailer . The FTC accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to make purchases on games such as Pet Shop Story and Ice Age Village , and estimated that around $ 86 million of unauthorized charges had been made as a result . Though Amazon insisted at the time that the FTC ’ s figures were flawed , and said it was improving the security of its app store with stricter procedures , Judge John Coughenour sided with the FTC in April of this year . The FTC called for Amazon to pay a $ 26.5 million lump-sum payout , but in his order issued this week , Judge Coughenour instead ordered Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds and to reimburse them appropriately . Reuters reports that Coughenour said the FTC ’ s damage requests were “ too high ” and there was a risk its figures could have taken unrelated failed password attempts into account . This order , he said , “ removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed . Moreover , it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers ” . Amazon requested permission to issue refunds in the form of gift cards , but this was rejected by the judge who said that the company would “ undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue ” . This isn ’ t the first time the FTC has filed cases against companies for insufficient methods of preventing unauthorized in-app purchases ; in 2014 the regulator took action against Apple and Google , resulting in both companies being ordered to issue refunds to their customers . Since these suits have been filed , all three companies have , as you ’ d expect , improved their security procedures in order to decrease the risk of unauthorized purchases .

iFixit has finally had its way with Google ’ s new smart connected speaker , the Google Home , and the teardown has revealed a significantly different piece of hardware than the Amazon Echo . The most interesting discovery is that the Home has just two microphones which it uses to pick up your voice , as opposed to the Echo ’ s seven-microphone array . The Echo ’ s substantial microphone array was cited as a reason for its ability to pick up your voice in noisy environments . It will be interesting to see whether the Google Home is quite as capable in that regard with its more limited two-mic array . The drivers across the two speakers also differ significantly . The Home has just one 2 ” driver alongside dual 2 ” passive radiators , while the Echo opts for a dual-speaker array of one 2.5 ” woofer and a 2.0 ” tweeter . Another interesting revelation from the speaker is how similar its innards are to Google ’ s Chromecast streamer . iFixit notes that the dual-core ARM Cortex-A7 media processor is the same , as is the 256 MB of NAND flash and the 512 MB of DDR3 SDRAM . We ’ re still getting to grips with the Google Home speaker for ourselves , but stay tuned for our full review coming soon .

We 've been keeping a close eye on Amazon Prime Air , the online retailer 's ambitious plan to deliver packages by drone , and we just learned more about the scheme courtesy of a patent filing published online . The patent shows `` airborne fulfilment centers '' , which are essentially Amazon warehouses in the sky , hovering above us at around 45,000 feet . The idea is drones can swoop down and back up with in-demand goods . One of the key advantages of Amazon 's futuristic cloud warehouses are that it makes it less likely your delivery drone is going to get shot out of the sky or tangled up in trees as it makes its outward and return journeys . According to the filing , the centers would be stocked up with specific inventory and flown to areas where high demand was anticipated - around big cities , for example , or near sporting events to deliver snacks and souvenirs . Jeff Bezos and his team would need a complex software system to keep track of all this and ensure your items were delivered on time , but the drones themselves would be able to form a mesh network , sharing information about weather conditions and routes . Bear in mind though that the usual caveats about patents apply - they 're only a sign of what companies are considering , and we may never actually see an Amazon zeppelin take to the skies . If it means faster deliveries , we 're all for it . Via TechCrunch

If you ’ re on the hunt for panic buys , last minute presents and vouchers for Christmas then TechRadar has a few suggestions . To bastardise the words of Blink-182 , it ’ s Christmas Eve and you ’ ve only wrapped two gosh-darn presents , but fear not , if your shopping has let you down , the parcel delivery services are not going to make it and you have mere hours to save the day , we have a host of ideas that could , we reckon , just save your festivities . The rise and rise of digital subscriptions means that , with a printer , a bit of artistic talent ( or a google image search ) you could offer up a genuinely brilliant present with nothing more than a code and a home-made voucher . How about signing a loved one up to Amazon Prime ? There ’ s a monthly fee for just the Amazon Prime video - which gives you a host of increasingly impressive content like The Man in the High Castle , or Transparent or you can go the whole hog and get the full prime subscription which includes music and a whole host of other things including the one day delivery on a big chunk of good that ( probably ) would have saved you this panic in the first place . And if it ’ s films and TV that you are looking for , there are definitely other pretty fantastic options . If you ’ re in the US then why not consider an HBO Go subscription , or for the UK a Now TV deal is only a click away . Of course , Netflix remains one of the best options for the small screen - and contains a wealth of the hit shows that have established its reputation including the phenomenal House of Cards and hit Marvel superhero show Jessica Jones . Spotify premium remains the major player , despite some big hitters moving in on their market . It 's become a hugely competent music offering that offers a great 'Discover ' playlist for keeping you on the hunt for new sounds . Apple Music is definitely a service that has improved beyond recognition and represents a very decent offering , especially for those that have a wealth of Apple devices in their lives . Amazon Music is another that is beginning to grab market share , and it plays brilliantly with the Echo and Echo Dot that have won critical acclaim ( check out our Amazon Echo review ) . Finally , if you like a service backed by some of the biggest names in music then Tidal is still afloat . And , as a ( terrible ) last resort , you could point out that the Boxing Day sales and January sales are just mere hours away and you wanted to get more bang for your buck .

While the likes of Google 's Project Wing and Amazon 's drone delivery service are still working out the details in delivery via autonomous aircraft , it appears the home of the Slurpee is strafing ahead the competition . 7-11 managed to complete 77 individual deliveries-by-drone as of this November , according to a press release from Flirtey , the company which operates the courier drones for the convenience store chain . 12 different customers in Reno , NV who lived within a mile of the test 7-11 store participated in the service . Using a dedicated app , the customers placed orders from a special list of available items ranging from over-the-counter medicine to breakfast items , and the GPS-guided drone would then make the drop in the average span of ten minutes . Flirtey claims its partnership with 7-11 marks the first time a drone delivery service has made regular drop-offs to a customer 's home - a monumental achievement in the field , especially given the progress of its competitors . The aforementioned projects from Google and Amazon , being larger in scope , still need to work with regulators to find ways to operate their services within the legal confines of drone operation . 7-11 and Flirtey were able to get a leg up seemingly by taking baby steps . Laws currently require drones ( even autonomous ones ) to operate within the operator 's line-of-sight unless given express permission from the FAA - something services like Google and Amazon 's services would likely function better without . By confining its efforts to a select group of people and making regular deliveries nearby , 7-11 was able to rack up considerable experience as unlikely leader in the drone delivery biz - and with seemingly good reception , as one customer is reported to have remarked the experience as something out of `` the real-life Jetsons . '' Flirtey made its first official autonomous drone delivery to a customer back in July , which you can watch in real-time in the video below :

Whether you 're booking an Uber , kicking off a Christmas playlist or looking up culinary recipes , Amazon Echo is already grabbing the voice-controlled headlines . But , in the UK at least , there 's been a giant hole in its arsenal of voice-app `` Skills '' , and that 's IFTTT integration . But that all changes today - a year after its US launch , the programming recipe service is now available in the UK . With IFTTT supported by so many other devices , that essentially puts Alexa and Echo right into the heart of the connected home . If you 've never tried IFTTT before , it 's a really powerful tool . Interacting with everything from smart thermostats to lightbulbs and even online services like Evernote , it lets you set rules to activate functions in devices and apps . So , for instance , you could make IFTTT talk to your Philips Hue bulbs and your Spotify app , dimming the lights automatically when you ask the app to play your `` Sexytime '' playlist . You 're limited pretty much by your imagination . Want to give it a go ? Head over to the Alexa channel for IFTTT - you 'll then need to follow the simple instructions to link all your devices together .
Imagine staying in a luxury resort , only to have no idea how to open the curtains , find the right TV channels or adjust the thermostat . Instead of putting a cadre of concierges on call 24/7 , the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas is installing an Amazon Echo speaker in each of its 4,748 rooms , allowing guests to augment their stay using Echo 's digital assistant , Alexa . `` As we have moved through the years , technology has always played an important part in our resorts , '' says Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn , noting the Sin City center will be among the first resorts to offer full voice control of its suites . Aspects of the room , such as temperature , drapes , lights and entertainment , will be accessed just by talking to the Echo . There was no mention of whether Alexa could also summon room service , which would be a supremely missed opportunity if that is n't the case . Alexa is expected to be fully up and running in each Wynn guest room by this coming summer . If you 'd prefer to experience the digital assistant in the comfort of your own home , you can pick up an Amazon Echo Dot for nearly a third of the price as the full-sized Echo - and probably less than a percent of the cost those luxury rooms in Vegas must go for .

After appearing on mobile devices and computers , Cortana ’ s next big role will be in Bluetooth speakers . As strange as it might seem , Harman Kardon has teased its upcoming premium speaker will come with Microsoft ’ s virtual assistant . From the 30 second video , we can hear Cortana responding to voice commands like playing a specific song and setting reminders . Though it seems simplistic at first , it ’ s likely Cortana will have her full set of abilities when we ’ ll likely see the speaker at CES 2017 and it releases sometime later in the same year . On PCs and smartphones , Cortana has already proven herself to be quick witted , capable of quick searches , learning more about you and making better suggestions over time . Of course , Cortana isn ’ t the only voice-controlled digital assistant built into a speaker . Amazon has already established itself in this space with its premium Echo speaker and a standalone voice controlled hub called the Echo Dot . Microsoft is also going to run into stiff competition with Google ’ s Assistant-driven Home smart speaker . Plus , anyone with an iPhone can also wirelessly connect Siri to their Bluetooth speaker . Despite the crowded platform , Cortana moving beyond the fold of computing and mobile devices is huge . This tease follows shortly after a WinHEC presentation described Cortana would be coming to refrigerators and thermostats . With all these developments coming next year , Cortana could soon become the center of the internet of things .
Amazon made it public knowledge that it was planning to launch a drone-powered delivery service a few years ago , and now we ’ re starting to see the idea become a reality as the company has announced its first successful drone delivery took place on December 7 . The Prime Air trial took place in Cambridge , England , with one of the company ’ s drones flying from the Cambridge fulfillment center to deliver a package . The entire process , from order to delivery , took only 13 minutes though obviously the speed is in part down to the fact that the customers taking part in the trial live close to the center . The delivery process was filmed for a promotional video released by Amazon , showing a customer making an order on his tablet , which is then packaged by a human in the fulfillment center . Once the order ( popcorn and an Amazon Fire TV stick , in case you were wondering ) has been placed in a box in the drone , the drone is moved along a conveyor belt , before taking off and autonomously making its way to the customer ’ s house guided by GPS . The drone lands on a special landing pad at the customer ’ s house and once the delivery has been collected from the drone by the customer , it takes off again and makes its way back to the center . Customers included in the trial will be able to order Prime Air deliveries seven days a week but they ’ ll be restricted to daylight hours and good weather conditions . Admittedly , winter seems like a less than ideal time for this . The fulfillment center in Cambridge has been built specifically for Amazon ’ s drone deliveries and Amazon has built other similar centers in the US , Austria , and Israel so it ’ s possible we ’ ll see similarly limited testing begin in these locations in the near future . According to Amazon , it will use the data and feedback gathered through these beta tests to expand its trials . At the moment the deliveries are only being made to two ( yes , two ) customers but Amazon intends to expand the service to “ dozens ” of others living near the Cambridge base soon . It ’ s likely to be a long time before we see the service expanded to more populated areas in the UK . Amazon has similar custom-built fulfillment centers in the US , Austria , and Israel so it 's likely that we 'll see similar tests taking place in these locations soon . The company has said it 'll have to work with regulators and policymakers in other countries before it 'll be able to expand the service to even more territories . That said , it ’ s exciting to see Amazon make progress with drone deliveries and if you want to see the trial for yourself , take a look at the video below .

No amount of deals and advances in shipping technology can keep you from just driving to the damned store and buying that thing . Amazon knows this . And , Amazon , in its infinite capitalistic wisdom , has an answer to that conundrum : Amazon Go . Announced via a simple YouTube video , Amazon Go is a real-life , brick-and-mortar grocery store based in Seattle , Washington that ’ s expected to open in early 2017 . The online retail giant has brought the heady concepts of machine learning , computer vision and “ sensor fusion ” – ooh , a new buzzword to use – together to create an internet-connected supermarket . The basic gist is that , with an Amazon Go app , folks can simply check into the Amazon Go store with a QR code scanner attached to a turnstiles . Then , every shelf in the store seems to be hooked up to a variety of sensors and cameras , so that it knows when you pick something up . From there , Amazon Go automatically updates a temporary cart within the app that fills up as you shop . Once you leave with those items the same way you came in , your Amazon account is charged for the total . If you decide to put something back before you leave , s ’ all good – your temporary cart automatically updates any changes . All of these bits of tech working together come under Amazon ’ s umbrella of what it calls “ Just Walk Out Technology. ” In other words , we ’ ve officially ran out of cool names for proprietary tech that isn ’ t actually proprietary at all . While many balked at Amazon ’ s physical bookstores – though , its Dash buttons seem to be popular – Amazon Go looks as if the company is truly onto something . At the very least , Amazon has brought self-checkout at the grocery store to its logical conclusion way faster than any of us were expecting . Look out for Amazon Go at 2131 7th Avenue in Seattle , Washington in early 2017 – or just wait until 2018 when this tech has taken over every supermarket you know .

With Amazon and Google pushing smart home speakers that can do your bidding in all kinds of clever ways , is Microsoft just going to sit by and watch ? Well , apparently not . Windows Central reports that Microsoft is planning an Amazon Echo-style product of its own called Home Hub . It 's not an all-knowing speaker that sits on your coffee table though - it 's going to be built into Windows 10 and help you control your smart home . As you might expect , Cortana plays a central role in the Home Hub plan , and apparently Microsoft has been working on this for a while . Cortana access on the lock screen , which was recently added to Windows 10 , is one part of the plan . The Home Hub will make life easier for families too , pulling together shared appointments and documents so you always know who 's got football practice and where the minutes from the last family meeting have got to . Unlike the Echo and Google Home , Microsoft 's Home Hub feature will have the benefit of a screen on whichever Windows 10 devices you 've got set up . Special interfaces showing family info at a glance are in the works , Windows Central says . While Microsoft wo n't make a dedicated device , other manufacturers might , sources say . Keep your eyes peeled for the next Windows update for more details - and we 'll see if Microsoft 's Echo competitor goes live before the one Apple is planning .

Amazon Prime Video is the premiere service to subscribe to if you want to watch any pre-2010 HBO show – one of the service ’ s key selling points is that it has everything from True Blood to The Sopranos , The Wire to Rome . But if you want something a bit more recent , like Game of Thrones or Westworld , you ’ d have been out of luck before today . The big change , though , is that Amazon has just announced its plan offer HBO and Cinemax streaming subscriptions to Amazon Prime subscribers . The services will cost $ 14.99 and $ 9.99 per month , respectively , and will offer both services ’ entire library of shows . Similarly to STARZ , Showtime , SeeSo , Comedy Central and other premium TV offerings , HBO and Cinemax are joining Amazon Channels , a series of supplemental subscriptions Amazon sells to compliment Prime Video . And while we can appreciate that the addition of more options for cord cutters is almost always a good thing , the move is a slightly baffling one considering that many of these services already offer their own services for the same price . ( No seriously , check out the price of an HBO Now subscription via its iOS app . ) That said , one minor convenience of going through Amazon is having one place with all your subscriptions instead of several separate locations . You can see all the channels as well as subscribe to HBO and Cinemax over at Amazon ’ s channel page . Via Business Wire

“ Alexa , do this. ” “ Alexa , do that. ” “ Alexa , fulfil my every whim . ” The Amazon Echo is a relatively new gadget - a little over a year old in the US - but it ’ s already crept its way into every corner of our home lives . From playing our every musical fancy to turning up our heating , and from checking our train times to ordering us a pizza , Alexa has quickly become our best electric mate and one that rarely lets us down . When you ask Alexa to do something she ’ s not capable of though it ’ s jarring . Why can ’ t she work with that device or service ? This just isn ’ t good enough . Our belief that we ’ re really living in the sci-fi inspired future is broken . Although the Echo has impressed , there ’ s still much that it needs to learn . Yes , Alexa is getting smarter by the day , but the sooner she adds support for this lot , the better . Picture the scene : you walk through the door , kick off your shoes and bellow ‘ Alexa , turn on my TV ’ . Hey presto , sorted . The telly is on while you get a beer from the fridge , no fuss , no fanfare just a single , simple command . Most TVs are connected to the internet now anyway , so there ’ s no reason why they can ’ t use those smart skills to play nice with Alexa and adhere to your every vocal command . From webOS to Android TV , all the individual Smart TV platforms would need an Alexa-friendly patch , but once set-up you ’ d be able to quit your nightly remote hunts and just talk to your TV instead . VR ’ s still in its infancy , and unless its user interfaces improve , it could stay there longer than it should . Holding your gaze on menu options to make selections is effective , but seriously slow and repetitive . Stating “ Alexa , ask Vive to launch Office Simulator ” or “ Alexa , ask Oculus to open my 360 Photos ” as soon as you don your VR headset would speed up the whole process no end . It would also save the problem of mistaken button presses that come with controllers you cant see . It would have another benefit too . VR can be a solitary , isolating experience , but talking to Alexa while in the virtual world could help make the whole thing more of a two-way experience . Slightly . How has this not already happened ? Skype seems an obvious way to communicate through Alexa , with the service ’ s VoIP calls capable of being triggered just by asking : “ Alexa , ask Skype to call Olivia . ” Not only would Alexa be able to place the calls for you , the Echo ’ s 360-degree speakers would pipe the conversation out into your home . It would be just like having your call on speaker mode , except you can carry on pottering around your room , with the Echo ’ s seven beam-forming directional microphones picking up everything you utter . “ Alexa , ask Sky to record Arsenal vs Liverpool for me . ” Boom , sorted . How much easier would that be ? That ’ s four minutes and about 18 button presses you ’ ve just saved yourself there as you scroll through the weekend ’ s fixture list , cussing under your breath as you realise the big match is actually BT Sport ’ s Monday night fixture . The dream situation would be that Alexa has access to the week ’ s full TV listings and has been synced up to your own Sky Q box . Now when you want to set something to record later in the week , you ’ ll be able to ask rather than do the manual work and kick off time hunting yourself . Thanks to Alexa , your Echo can look after your calendar and relay upcoming appointments to you to ensure you never miss a meeting . But what about those Facebook-hosted event invites and reminders ? Play time is just as important as work efforts , and hooking Facebook up to the Echo could be a way to find this balance . Although you don ’ t need every motivational quote and humble bragbook post that pops up on your News Feed verbally relaying to you , being able to ask “ Alexa , ask Facebook when Saturday ’ s party starts ” or “ Alexa , ask Facebook how old Harry will be on Tuesday ” could have genuine benefits . Amazon Music Unlimited is supported , obviously , But so too are TuneIn and even Spotify , so where is the Apple Music Alexa love ? If you pay for the streaming service , you ’ re going to want to listen to it where and however you want . With the rise of digital assistants and smart speakers , that now includes through devices like the Amazon Echo . The foundations are already there - Alexa knows how to play music and Apple Music supports Siri - but the bit in the middle is currently missing . Given we ’ re still waiting for an Amazon Prime Apple TV app to drop , and Apple ’ s notorious need for independence , we can ’ t see this happening anytime soon , but we can dream can ’ t we ? OK , so those must have ’ 90s machines with the little blinking red light might not be commonplace anymore , but for those that have them , or those who still get voicemails on their smartphone , asking “ Alexa , play my new messages ” could be a welcome addition . Like with Skype calls , these would then be piped out through the Echo ’ s circular speaker , letting you listen back to what you missed . As you quickly work out whether the call is PPI junk or something actually important , follow up requests like “ Alexa , delete ” or “ Alexa , return call ” could be addressed too , doing away with all those traditional , fiddly button presses . Netflix ’ s picture-led interface is pretty and the foundation for everything that ’ s followed ( we ’ re looking at you Sky Q , Apple TV and Amazon Prime ) , but it ’ s also a bit on the busy side . It ’ s all too easy to spend as much time scrolling through trying to pick a film as it does to watch the damn thing . That ’ s where Alexa could come in , using Netflix ’ s strong sub categories and search system to find you a film in double quick time . Requests we ’ d like to see made possible include “ Alexa , play me a ‘ 90s horror movie , ” “ Alexa , show me a list of films directed by Danny Boyle , ” and , most importantly , “ Alexa , find me any comedy that doesn ’ t feature Adam Sandler ” . Siri can dictate WhatsApp messages , so why can ’ t Alexa ? Perfect for when you ’ re phone ’ s charging on the other side of the room to where you ’ re sat , WhatsApp integration for Echo would give you the freedom to hold conversations without the endless and often error-strewn touchscreen typing . As well as letting you read out the messages you want sent , WhatsApp support could also get Alexa reading your incoming messages to you , leaving your phone free for other tasks , such as browsing Facebook , sending Snapchats or a solid game of Hill Climb Racing 2 . Microsoft has already trialed voice-based Xbox commands , but being able to ask for your disc to be ejected isn ’ t exactly the biggest win . Syncing your internet-connected PS4 to your Echo , however , opens up a new world of possibilities . It could get you gaming quicker too . Asking “ Alexa , check my PS4 for updates ” could do away with the disheartening disappointment that comes every time you sit down for a session and are forced to wait 30 minutes for six updates and game patches to download and install . Once you ’ re finally gaming , you could speak out social chats to be written out and sent to rival gamers and even get feedback on high scores and handy hints - “ Alexa , act as my wingman and alert me to sniper sightings . ”

The Amazon Echo is about to make some dreams come true . Starting today , you can now change Alexa ’ s wake word to “ computer ” instead of its name . Like a proper Starfleet officer , you can simply lead a question with the new wake word , and Alexa – the built-in artificial intelligence – will respond . It might not be the HoloDeck that we were promised 40 years ago , but it ’ s a small step in the right direction . To change the Echo or the Echo Dot ’ s wake word , open the Alexa app and select settings . Select your device from the menu and scroll down until you see the option for wake word . Then use the drop-down menu to select a wake word , and then select Save . When you change the wake word Amazon says the light ring on your device flashes orange briefly . Once you ’ ve got your AI companion to respond to the new wake word , all that ’ s left to do is seal the hull of your ship and wait for the eventual Borg invasion .

Getting a new games console is an exciting experience , but it can also be an expensive one . As well as having to spend your hard-earned money buying a new system , you 'll probably need to fork out for various accessories if you want to get the most out of it . Then there are the games , which are often pricey for a system that ’ s only just hit the shelves . Thankfully , Amazon has been offering some pretty steep discounts on the hottest upcoming Nintendo Switch games to Prime members , which is great if you ’ re looking to cheaply build up a library of new games .

Amazon Prime Video may have made its name on original series like Transparent , Mozart in the Jungle , and Man in the High Castle , but the e-market powerhouse has had little for anime fans to enjoy - until now . Amazon has unveiled Anime Strike for its Prime Video service , allowing viewers to stream contemporary anime series and movies - alongside a few classics like Ouran High School Host Club and Akira - right to their favorite devices for an extra $ 4.99 a month . The 'extra ' there is key . Anime Strike operates through Amazon Channels - Prime Video 's series of add-on premium networks like Showtime , HBO and Starz - meaning that interested anime watchers will need to also be Amazon Prime subscribers to access the channel . An Amazon Prime membership starts at $ 10.99 a month ( or $ 99 a year ) though those interesting in just the streaming perks can subscribe to a standalone Prime Video membership for $ 8.99 a month . Anime Strike 's selection , though a bit on the thin end at the time of writing , is expected to expand and refresh on a weekly basis , according to The Hollywood Reporter . Five bucks on top of an already perk-stuffed service like Prime is n't too bad a deal , especially considering Anime Strike plans to run ongoing series like Scum 's Wish and Blue Exorcist : Kyoto Saga as soon as they air in Japan - a feature many on-the-pulse fans will appreciate . That said , Strike has its work cut out for it . Internet-savvy fans of Japanese animation tired of importing old DVDs are likely already subscribers to Crunchyroll - the reigning big dog in anime streaming . Crunchyroll 's premium subscription offers unlimited anime viewing for just $ 6.95 a month , though curious folks can still try the newest Amazon Channel free for seven days . ( We regret to report that we could n't find Dragon Ball Super or One-Punch Man anywhere but hey , Paprika is still really good ! )
Nvidia wants its new Nvidia Shield Android TV gaming box to be the center of your living room - and your smart home , too . It 's being lined-up as a premium Google Assistant experience , controlling smart home devices with a voice-activated controller and including Samsung 's `` SmartThings '' tech . But , if CES 2017 proved anything , it 's Amazon 's Alexa that is proving itself as the go-to smart home voice assistant , which Nvidia is aware of . Despite the current focus on Google Assistant , the graphics chip specialists are open to integrating Alexa into its Shield devices in the future . `` It 's an Android TV box , so it it makes sense to focus on Google Assistant at present , '' said Nvidia 's Director of Technical Product Marketing , Sridhar Ramaswamy , at a Shield preview event . `` But Shield has always been an open product , so that does n't mean we 've ruled out other platforms . I would n't rule out Alexa . '' Regardless , Google Assistant support will not launch alongside the new console , it 's scheduled to land in the coming months as an Android TV update , hopefully before the summer . Alexa could even become an item that homebrew devs bring to the platform themselves since the Shield has become the got-to device for home entertainment tinkerers in general , and this is a position Nvidia is keen to cultivate . `` One of the reasons we made Shield an open-source platform was that it allows the device to be rooted . People can sideload what they want onto the device . '' said Ramaswamy . `` If you can do all the stuff , then all the power to you . We know a lot of people are using the Shield as a Kodi box , because it delivers the best Kodi experience . A lot of people are downloading emulators and using Shield for retro gaming . People are side-loading Chrome browser and using it for bigscreen web-browsing too . We totally encourage that - we 're not closing you off from any experience . '' With the Shield standing alone as a premium media streamer , Nvidia does n't currently have any direct competition in the space , and as a result it 's free to try anything its fans cry out for .

Apple 's voice assistant Siri has been knocking about in Apple products since the launch of the iPhone 4S way back in October 2011 . So , with the current wave of home voice assistants storming the tech world , you 'd think Apple would be keen on having an answer to Amazon 's Echo and the Google Home . Think again . Speaking to the Backchannel blog to mark the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone 's launch , Apple SVP Phil Schiller suggests that the company has little time for voice-only products and interfaces . `` Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere , ” he said . For Schiller ( and Apple , when you count the man as the company 's mouthpiece as senior vice president of worldwide marketing ) , the importance of display technology remains key to a comfortable user interaction . “ People are forgetting the value and importance of the display , ” said Schiller . “ Some of the greatest innovations on iPhone over the last ten years have been in display . Displays are not going to go away . We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them , and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is . ” Not that Schiller feels that Siri can not hold its own in this voice-focussed arena . `` I ’ m so glad the team years ago set out to create Siri — I think we do more with that conversational interface than anyone else , '' he stated . But with a recent CES that was dominated by voice-controlled products - predominately those featuring Amazon 's Alexa assistant - Schiller 's stance is beginning to look merely defensive , a protective measure for the ten year legacy of the screen-focused iPhone experience .

Smartphone addiction , be gone ! Las Vegas has been invaded by Alexa , and the smart home looks like it might have been colonized at last . Earlier this week Shawn DuBravac , chief economist at CES organizer the Consumer Technology Association ( CTA ) , said “ voice is going to be the glue ” that holds the smart home together , forecasting that another 4.5 million ‘ digital assistant devices ’ will sell in 2017 , up more than 50 % on last year . But the emergence of Alexa is about much more than voice control – it ’ s about networking , with myriad gadgets now allowing the user to speak to other gadgets around the home via microphones on everything . You know about the Huawei Mate 9 and Olly , so here are just a few more of the dozens of gadgets at CES making Alexa a trend worth , er , shouting about… It ’ s dressed up as the best robot vacuum cleaner ever , and it can be controlled via a smartphone app , but what ’ s really interesting about the VR7000 is its Alexa integration . It ’ s not clear exactly how far that goes , but you can expect to be able to start or stop the machine , as well as ask Alexa anything you want , through the VR7000 . However , scheduling cleaning times and checking its cleaning history ( yeah , that ’ s what we want to do with our lives ) is all done via an app , so the VR7000 does have one foot/wheel in the old world . Four inches tall , the VR7000 has 20W of suction power . Selling for a mere US $ 35 ( around £28/AU $ 48 ) from early February , the Vobot Clock is a smart alarm that ’ s based on the Amazon ecosystem . Essentially a 5W speaker with a dot matrix display , the Vobot Clock is designed for the bedside table , kitchen counter , living room , or anywhere else that needs a voice-controlled companion . You can talk to Alexa through it , but there ’ s more to it than that , with various white noise and hypnotic music options , customised music alarms , and sleep coaching modes . Hands-free around the home is great , but what about when you ’ re on the go , or out enjoying your annual post-Christmas run around the lake ? A background technology rather than an actual product , Californian tech company Sensory unveiled an addition to its VoiceGenie tech ( currently used by Plantronics and FiiL ) at CES that allows a hands-free Bluetooth headset to communicate with Alexa via a smartphone . As well as using it to switch on a light as you approach your home , it also integrates with wearable devices . “ You don ’ t want to have to go home and ask Echo how many steps you took , you want to know right then as you ’ re running , ” says Jeff Rogers , VP of Sales at Sensory , who demoed a FiiL Bluetooth headset and some FiiL Diva Pro headphones being used to ask Alexa to ask Fitbit for live data . It makes perfect sense . Why not just give everything , everywhere to Alexa ? You ’ re probably familiar with WeMo gear , which connects home appliances – typically lights – to the WeMo app so that they can be controlled from a smartphone . Great – but apps are dead , so what now ? Cue voice activation , of course , via pairing with Amazon Echo . Just in case Amazon doesn ’ t end up ruling our homes , the WeMo Mini , out in February for US $ 34.99 ( around £28/AU $ 48 ) , is also compatible with Google Home , Next and IFTTT . WeMo has also announced a Dimmer switch ( out in the spring , price TBC ) , which can be both activated by voice and used to talk to Alexa . If the smart home is going Alexa-crazy , why can ’ t the internet of things ( IoT ) ? Amazon Web Services is a key platform for the software developers currently creating the IoT , who can already access Alexa . But at CES 2017 it ’ s become clear that Alexa fever is spreading . AT & T ’ s IoT Starter Kit – essentially some time-saving hardware with a SIM that works in 200-plus countries – was announced at the show to be compatible with AWS and , therefore , with Alexa . “ You could have a machine user interface that ’ s voice-enabled , so an engineer could speak to a machine and run diagnostics , ” said Mobeen Khan , associate VP for IoT solutions , AT & T . It ’ s a bit of a mouthful – but then that ’ s kind of the point of this Alexa-enabled TV from Westinghouse , designed for the US market and debuting at CES . On-demand content , including shows from HBO Go and , of course , Amazon Prime Video , can be searched for by voice . The experience of talking into the special new Amazon remote control ( it looks like Apple TV ’ s remote ) will be familiar to anyone who ’ s used a voice-enabled TV before , but during our demo there was one major difference – it worked every time . If you can ’ t join Amazon , beat it . Also , join it . A small tubular 360-degree speaker that looks uncannily like the Amazon Echo , the Lenovo Premium Smart Assistant is all about boosting sound quality . Built around an Intel Celeron N3060 processor , the Smart Assistant has Harmon Kardon speakers ( which contain a 5W tweeter and 1W woofer ) . It ’ s got exactly the same functionality as the Echo , and costs US $ 179.99 ( around £145/AU $ 245 ) – while a non-premium Lenovo Smart Assistant will also be available for US $ 129 ( around £105/AU $ 180 ) . Talking to a TV isn ’ t new , but asking Alexa to navigate , search and play TV content is . Once it ’ s been paired with an Amazon Echo or Echo Dot , users of the new web-based and US-only DISH Hopper DVR can go hands-free by asking Alexa things like “ Watch Game of Thrones season 1 , episode 2 ” and “ Go to ESPN ” . “ You no longer have to set down your popcorn to change the channel , or spend time searching for what channel the game is on – just ask Alexa to do it for you , ” says Rob Pulciani , Director , Amazon Alexa , announcing Amazon 's partnership with DISH . It ’ s out in the first half of 2017 . An Alexa-activated , 360-degree omni-directional Bluetooth speaker system seems simple enough , but the Dok Talk CR25 is much more than just a voice-controlled boombox . Essentially a generously-featured device charger , it ’ s got niceties like surge protection for guarding against voltage spikes during storms , while multiple microphones mean far-field voice recognition even if you talk to it from across the room . That ’ s crucial , because the Dok Talk CR25 is mostly about allowing you to listen to music , talk on the phone or access the web on up to five gadgets as they recharge . Obviously , all of this can be done via Alexa , turning it into a smart home hub that would work in open-plan homes and loft conversions . It ships in April 2017 for US $ 189 ( around £155/AU $ 260 ) . Announced in December and being shown off at CES , this Alexa hub on the bedside table seems appropriate if every room needs integrating into the smart home . GE bills it as the ‘ ultimate living experience ’ , which is a heavy burden for what is essentially an LED lamp with Wi-Fi and a microphone , but it ’ s evidence that more voice gadgetry is starting to be built into furniture and fittings . “ Voice is the future of home automation , and the combination of Alexa with the GE LED table lamp provides people with a simple and frictionless way to interact with their homes , ” said Amazon Alexa 's Aaron Brown .

In case you have n't heard , Amazon Alexa is everywhere at CES 2017 , and now the virtual assistant is coming to cars . Ford is delivering Alexa support to its vehicles , calling the mash-up the most comprehensive integration of the assistant in any car yet . Alexa is actually arriving in two parts . First , Ford will let plug-in electric car owners control their vehicle from home using an Amazon Echo , Echo Dot or Amazon Tap . While you 're snug on the couch , you can start or stop the engine , lock or unlock doors , check range , charge status and fuel level and get a mileage summary . This functionality will arrive later in the month . Then in the summer , Alexa will be accessible inside cars equipped with Ford 's SYNC 3 system with the tap of a button on the steering wheel . Once you 've called up Alexa , you can have it report on the weather , play music or audio books , check news and add items to a shopping list , as well as control smart home devices from the car . Perhaps most useful of all , Alexa will have navigation capabilities , helping you locate a destinations like a nearby restaurant if you ask . Ford says this is the tightest automotive integration of Alexa yet . Of course , we 've already seen Apple Siri and Google Assistant make it into cars , but Amazon is now putting its foot in the auto assistant race as well . We 'll have to wait to find out whether Alexa in cars takes off , particularly if it expands to other vehicle manufacturers . But this has become a three-assistant race , which is always exciting to see .

“ Alexa , Who ’ s winning CES 2017 ? ” “ I am . ” Amazon ’ s voice assistant has already made a huge dent on the smart home , with its low-cost Echo and Echo Dot quickly winning over a previously cynical audience . But , if you want to know just how significant Alexa is to the smart home market , then you only have to look at CES 2017 . We are just a day in and the sheer level of partnerships the shopping megalith has sealed is impressive . Although Google , Microsoft , Samsung and Apple are all beginning to compete with their smart home and voice assistant plays - Amazon has quickly stolen a march on the competition by brute force . Even before 'CES proper ' has started , the name on everyone ’ s tongue is Alexa . Amazon ’ s baby was a heavy presence at the traditionally huge LG conference , slotting into the company ’ s fridge so you can make sure you stick milk on your shopping list without going anywhere near a pen . Even before CES has started the name on everyone ’ s tongue is Alexa Car giant Ford ’ s big CES announcement was all about Alexa - letting you get your house ready before you get home , check the traffic or even start up your car without leaving your house . Which is , frankly , a bit alarming . Then there 's Lenovo , who has outed a smart-looking Echo rival with Alexa voice support . Vobot , on the other hand , have added Alexa to its smart alarm clock so you can now scream back at the thing that wakes you up and it will respond . And the fun doesn ’ t stop there . Three smaller TV makers Seiki , Westinghouse and Element will offer Amazon functionality and Alexa through microphone-toting remote controls . Even audio company Monster are in on the Alexa action . The CTA , the body behind CES , believes the final figure for devices equipped with Alexa will be nearing the 700 mark . It ’ s a remarkable set of announcements for Amazon as it looks to take on some of the biggest guns on good ship consumer electronics . Amazon is clearly aware that to dominate the market you don ’ t have to be the best , you simply have to be good enough and at a price point where it becomes an easy addition to the home . The Black Friday sales gave the company a perfect showcase for Echo - with millions visiting Amazon to snap up a bargain and getting a glimpse of the heavily marketed new devices and a chunk of discount as well . Don ’ t discount the importance of the Dots that ended up as Christmas presents because of the relatively low cost . This is , in truth , still early days for the smart home - and expect salvos from all the major players including the behemoth that is Apple - but momentum may be a crucial factor in the great smart home land grab . If Amazon can continue to rack up partnerships with huge companies like LG and Ford , continue to add features ( or ‘ Skills ’ in Amazon parlance ) that let us take advantage of an always-on helper and continue to press home the early advantage then it may be Alexa , rather than Cortana or Siri that becomes the omnipresent voice in our lives .

Good news : You won ’ t have to buy that Amazon Fire TV you ’ ve had your eye on – it will soon come built right into your TV with Alexa in toe . Seiki , Westinghouse and Element announced today at CES 2017 that they will each offer a range of TVs for 2017 that will , among other features , include Fire TV OS . The TVs will not only have access to Alexa via a microphone-equipped remote but , more importantly , will have access to the over 7,000 apps and games available on the Amazon Fire TV Store – a huge boon considering that most of these Smart TVs usually include , at max , a few dozen apps . So how will you know which TVs come with Alexa and which ones don ’ t ? All TVs that feature Fire TV OS will be called “ 4K Ultra HD Smart TVs – Amazon Fire TV Edition ” . Simple enough . The screens in the series will also feature a built-in channel guide that will dredge up new content for you to watch or , if you want to use that new remote , use voice search to find new TV shows and movies to watch based on your favorite actors and actresses . All TVs in the series will come in four sizes – 43 , 50 , 55 and 65-inches – and will offer 4K resolution for UHD streaming of , what else , Amazon Prime Instant Video . They ’ ll also have 3 GB of built in RAM ; 16 GB built-in storage ; built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi , four HDMI 2.0 inputs supporting 60Hz 4K video and HDCP 2.2 , Ethernet port , and two USB inputs include one supporting USB 3.0 . The Seiki , Westinghouse and Element Smart 4K Ultra HD – Amazon Fire TV Edition models will be available later this year on Amazon as well as other retailers , and pricing will be announced closer to launch .
Fancy an Amazon Echo , but love brick-and-mortar bookshops too much to entertain putting another couple of notes in Jeff Bezos ' pockets ? The Lenovo Smart Assistant , making its debut at CES 2017 , may be what you 're after . Why ? Because it 's basically an Amazon Echo clone , minus the Amazon branding . The Chinese manufacturer , best known for its laptops and smartphones , is looking to break into the home tech area at this year 's CES with its own voice-activated cylindrical speaker , powered by Amazon 's own Alexa assistant technology . There 's really not much to separate Lenovo 's offering from Amazon 's , with the key differences being interchangeable color options ( a bit like Google Home , somewhat ironically ) , and the option of a premium Harmon Kardon audio equipped version . That should up the volume output and general speaker clarity – although hopefully the microphones are of an equally high standard , or all the smart features are rendered a bit moot . Eight 360-degree far field mics are built in , which could give the Lenovo the edge over the seven found in an Echo . Other than that , it 's Echo-like business as usual , with the speaker responding to voice commands , letting you access music streaming services , news reports , reminders and your Amazon shopping list , along with all manner of home automation options providing you have other internet of things items installed . The base model , minus the Harmon Kardon audio chops , undercuts the Echo a little at a US price of $ 130 , while the premium version sits at $ 170 . International pricing is yet to be revealed , but a straight conversion puts the pair at AU $ 180/£105 and AU $ 235/£138 respectively . The big winner here of course is Amazon – licensing out Alexa to its biggest third-party partner yet , it 's proving that its voice assistant is a true platform in its own right , not just merely a product line .

With the biggest technology show on the calendar just days away , LG has been teasing more details about what we can expect to see from the South Korean company at CES 2017 - and it sounds like it 's going big on robotics . Included in the devices LG announced over the weekend is a `` Hub Robot '' that 's going to `` double as a smart home gateway and a personal assistant for consumers '' . Sounds a lot like an Amazon Echo or Google Home to us . There 's also going to be a robot to help with the yard work on show in Las Vegas , as well as droids designed to lend a hand to travelers in airports and hotels . These will all be previews of forthcoming tech , so actual launch dates might be some way away . `` By leveraging powerful analytical processing power , LG 's robotic lineup will be able to navigate complex environments and decipher the most efficient and effective path to accomplish tasks , making people ’ s lives easier at every touch-point , '' says LG . It 's not LG 's first foray into robots : the company already makes an automated vacuum cleaner and earlier in 2016 showed off a rolling robot alongside its new LG G5 smartphone , albeit one that was never destined to actually go on sale . You can expect to hear much more about these new robots from CES , with the LG event scheduled for 8am PST ( 4pm GMT ) on Wednesday January 4 . As always , TechRadar will be bringing you the news as it happens .

Arguably even more useful than summoning pizza , Amazon 's line of Echo smart speakers may one day tell different users apart just by hearing their voices . Amazon is reportedly working on a feature for the Echo 's digital assistant , Alexa , that allows it to distinguish between users based on their vocal print , anonymous sources familiar with the matter tell Time . Alexa-enabled devices like the Echo and scaled-down Echo Dot can currently swap between users via the Alexa app or saying `` switch accounts '' to the device , but this feature would allow Alexa to know who 's who without needing to manually set a new active user . Recognizing a user 's `` Voice ID '' - the name engineers at Amazon allegedly call the in-development feature - comes with benefits besides just convenience . For starters , vocal recognition could be used for verifying purchases made through an Echo , ensuring that only those authorized to use the credit card paired with the smart speaker are the ones calling in orders . Additionally , knowing who 's speaking could further improve Alexa 's ability to make individual recommendations for media , products , news , or other miscellanea tied to a single user 's tastes . One example where this could come in handy is with music streaming services like Amazon Prime Music or Spotify , wherein Alexa can play music you 'd like in a snap rather than , say , accidentally resume that One Direction playlist your younger sibling was listening to earlier . Though it seems like the logical next step for Amazon 's audio-based assistant , the retail/tech giant has yet to officially confirm it is working on Voice ID . That said , as competing assistants like Apple 's Siri and Google Assistant heat up the competition , we would n't be surprised if the feature makes an appearance in the coming months as a way for Amazon to set Alexa apart from the pack .

As the biggest of all the film awards ceremonies , the Oscars work as a great litmus test for the film industry at large . Aside from this year ’ s Oscars being one of the most diverse ever - and controversial given the La La Land / Moonlight award mix-up - it was also surprising to see so many streaming services represented up on stage . Netflix documentary The White Helmets picked up an award for Best Documentary Short for its exploration of the work of the Syrian rescue service of the same name . But the real success was had by Amazon Prime Video ’ s Manchester by the Sea which picked up two awards on the night , one for best original screenplay , and another for best actor - which went to Casey Affleck . Best Documentary was also won by The Salesman , a documentary by Asghar Farhadi and distributed by Amazon Studios . This year the awards have shown what a good job the likes of Amazon and Netflix are doing with their original content . As well as putting out mass-market hits like Stranger Things and Mr Robot , the two companies are also promoting small-budget indie films like those nominated last night . With the amount of money earned by streaming services increasing year by year , expect these to be two names that will crop up more and more at these kinds of awards ceremonies . They are so prevalent to the movie space , that even Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was given a shoutout by Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel . Joking , he said : “ Jeff Bezos is the founder and CEO , and I want to say congratulations to Jeff . `` And I also want you to know , if you win tonight , you can expect your Oscar to arrive in two to five business days , possibly stolen by a GrubHub delivery man . ”

Motorola has confirmed it will be bringing Amazon Alexa to the Moto Z and other Motorola phones in 2017 . Amazon and Motorola announced the project live at Mobile World Congress 2017 but did n't explain much about how the voice assistant technology would work inside your phone . Motorola did confirm you could use services such as Uber or Spotify , and you 'll simply be able to talk to your phone when Alexa is around without touching the device . You ’ ll be able to say `` Alexa '' to activate it , much like you do on the Amazon Echo . Whether Motorola will be bringing Google Assistant – the voice assistant packed into Android 7 – to its upcoming smartphones is unclear . It ’ s also not clear what devices will be including the new Alexa technology , but Motorola did say it ’ s planning to include it in most of its lineup going forward . Whether the newly announced Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus will include the technology remains unclear . Motorola also announced a new Alexa mod for the Moto Z that allows you to use Amazon ’ s technology , but it ’ s not currently clear what benefit this would add over the newly announced tech baked into some of the phones . MWC ( Mobile World Congress ) is the world 's largest exhibition for the mobile industry , stuffed full of the newest phones , tablets , wearables and more . TechRadar is reporting live from Barcelona all week to bring you the very latest from the show floor . Head to our dedicated MWC 2017 hub to see all the new releases , along with TechRadar 's world-class analysis and buying advice about your next phone .

Amazon ’ s voice assistant Alexa will soon be coming to a wide range of wearable and portable products including headphones , speakers and fitness trackers . That ’ s because support for the Alexa wake word is being brought to a selection of Qualcomm ’ s Bluetooth SoCs ( system-on-chips ) , which will find their way into a variety of products over the next couple of years . This will allow users of devices featuring these Bluetooth chips to use the “ Alexa ” phrase to wake the assistant and utilise the information service it delivers . You ’ ll need to have the Alexa app downloaded on your phone , so you ’ ll need to make sure your handset is close by , but devices will support the ‘ barge-in ’ feature which allows music playback to be interrupted when the Alexa trigger is said . For products that already use Qualcomm ’ s CSR8670 and CSR8675 Bluetooth Audio SoCs , the Alexa wake word support can also be made available with a software update , which means we won ’ t have to wait for new devices to enter the market before taking advantage of this feature . It ’ s currently not clear which devices will receive the update , or when new products offering the service will enter the market .
Since Amazon opened up its Alexa Skills Kit to developers just under two years ago , its Alexa voice service has managed to learn over 10,000 skills . That means whether you own an Echo , a Dot , a Tap or one of the many third party devices that support the voice assistant , you have access to 10,000 apps that can be controlled using only your voice . Now , some of the skills are certainly more useful than others , but considering in June last year Amazon announced that Alexa had reached 1000 skills , this is some impressive growth . In the last month alone 3000 skills were added to the service and they range from smart home and car controls , to food ordering services and a handful of games like the Magic Door . Though Alexa ’ s skills are increasing rapidly in number and diversity , it ’ s still not quite at the offering level of Apple and Google – across the App Store and Google Play there are millions of apps available to download . It is , however , far in front of its smart home competition Google Home whose available commands are at a lower number . Though it doesn ’ t have millions of apps , Alexa has the advantage of not being constrained to a smartphone or tying its user to a screen . At this year ’ s CES it became clear that Alexa is gunning to take over our homes . Outside of the Echo and the Echo Dot , Alexa is available in a host of other devices from fridges to cars to alarm clocks thanks to some savvy partnerships being made by Amazon . Not only has Alexa ’ s number of skills and supported devices increased , it ’ s also become easier to use . Developers are constantly improving the skills they offer based on customer feedback , adapting them so that they fit more seamlessly into our lives . Arguably , it ’ s more beneficial to the customer to have thousands of well-developed and useful skills rather than millions of skills of a varying quality . Alexa ’ s skill set may be growing at an an impressive rate , but there ’ s a danger that the number of skills available could reach a number that would leave consumers feeling overwhelmed and cluttered . To keep on top of this problem , Amazon sends emails summarizing new skills that have been added and it ’ s created an online skills store where users can see ratings and reviews . It seems to be working thus far , but whether it will continue to be effective when Alexa ’ s skills reach the millions is yet to be seen . Thanks to its ever-growing skillset and range of supported hardware , Alexa has a lot to offer that smartphone voice assistants and Google Home do n't and after this most recent announcement it does n't seem to show any signs of slowing down . In case you were wondering , Alexa 's 10000th skill is a game called Beat the Intro where players listen to the start of songs and have to guess what they 're listening to .
A central part of Amazon ’ s internet connected smart speaker , the Amazon Echo , is that it ’ s constantly listening for you to say the magic words to wake it from its slumber . Not unsurprisingly this has generated some privacy concerns , with users worried that the data collected by the speaker could prove to be a treasure trove for hackers , or law enforcement officers . Now the latter case is being tested to its limits , and Amazon is fighting pretty hard to protect its Amazon Echo data . Back in November 2015 , Victor Collins was found dead in the hot tub of his friend , James Andrew Bates , as reported by the BBC . The evening of Collins ’ death , the two were allegedly using an Echo to stream music , which has lead detectives to believe that Amazon may hold data which could help them solve the case . In a motion filed by Amazon ’ s lawyers , the company said , “ Given the important First Amendment and privacy implications at stake , the warrant should be quashed unless the Court finds that the State has met its heightened burden for compelled production of such materials . '' In other words , Amazon is pushing back hard against the motion in the same way as Apple did in the San Bernardino iPhone case . But what data does Amazon actually hold from an Echo ? The Echo only begins recording when its wake word ( ‘ Alexa ’ by default ) is said . In theory this means that the only data Amazon holds is a record of your past commands and searches , and none of this is stored locally . But as anyone with an Echo can attest , the speaker has a habit of mis-hearing other words as ‘ Alexa ’ and waking when you don ’ t expect it to . It ’ s this occurrence that detectives are hoping to make use of . They ’ re hoping that the speaker may have inadvertently activated itself and recorded a key piece of evidence . Everyone can agree that finding the cause of Collins ’ death and bringing those responsible to justice is a noble aim , but Amazon ’ s stance is an important one if people are going to trust having ever-listening speakers present in their home . As with the San Bernardino iPhone case , this has the potential to turn into a long and very ugly court case with the potential of establishing an important precedent for the future . However , with no data stored locally on the device law enforcement officials won ’ t be able to access the information without Amazon ’ s help .

Those looking to a little Amazon shopping without dropping money on an Amazon Prime subscription could have an easier time avoiding mailing fees , as as the online retailer dropped the minimum price for free shipping . Non-Prime subscribers in the US can score free shipping for qualifying orders costing $ 35 or more - down from Amazon 's previous minimum of $ 49 , which was implemented almost exactly a year ago , according to The Verge . An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the new rates with us , though did not detail any specific reasons behind the switch . It 's likely the price drop resulted from competition heating up after Walmart instituted its own free two-day shipping policy on orders over $ 35 last month , according to CNET . While the price has fluctuated , the limitations on free two-day shipping from Amazon remains unchanged . To qualify , free shipping on orders must contain $ 35 among over 50 million applicable items of merchandise - or just $ 25 if it 's exclusively books - and be shipped to the US . Some exceptions exist for the states of Hawaii and Alaska depending on the products purchased , and APO/FPO addresses are applicable so long as they contain a US zip code . By contrast , Amazon Prime subscribers receive free two-day shipping on any eligible items , regardless of a minimum amount . First-time customers can try the service for free during a 30-day trial and qualify for the reduced shipping rates .

One day , you may be able to chat with someone far away using just the smart speaker in your living room or kitchen . Specifically , you may be communicating through Google Home or Amazon Echo , if a new report is to be believed . Word from Wall Street Journal sources is that Google and Amazon are working to add phone calling and receiving functionality to their devices , and it could arrive sometime this year . This would effectively turn the smart speakers into landlines , letting users hold voice conversations without picking up a handset - great if you 're cooking , busy around the house or using your smart speaker anyway and need to make a call . It would also add value to the Google Home and Amazon Echo , giving them one more function , and therefore one more reason for people to buy . While the ability to make voice calls could arrive for one or both devices before long , there are a few kinks to work out . Amazon , for one , does n't have an existing phone offering . Its rival , meanwhile , has the Google Voice service as well as Project Fi phone network , both of which could give it a leg up in developing smart speaker calls . Privacy is another worry as any Home or Echo conversations you have would be audible to anyone within earshot . Amazon is said to be looking into different ways to go about adding voice calling , such as letting users keep the phone number they already have , giving the Echo its own digits or by utilizing call forwarding . Time will tell whether voice calls are added to the market 's top smart speakers , but it 's certainly an intriguing idea that wo n't likely fade away soon . Via The Verge

`` Look ! Up in the sky ! It 's a bird ! It 's a plane ! Oh , it 's the yoga pants and batteries I ordered off Amazon being delivered . '' We 're not there yet , but Amazon is working to bring us goods by drone , and a new patent uncovered by CNN shows the online retail giant may employ another bit of aviation tech in its scheme , better known as parachutes . The patent was granted on Tuesday , and according to the CNN report , it outlines a way to safely steer packages after they 've absconded from the unmanned aircraft , which in turn would n't have to touch down to complete deliveries . Instead of the drone continually landing and taking off from people 's yards – a task fraught with the risk of hitting humans , pets , trees , etc – it could release a package while it 's flying by employing parachutes , magnets or spring coils , according to the patent . If the package started to veer away from its intended landing zone , the drone , remaining close by to ensure the order arrives at its destination , would send a signal to open parachutes , blast compressed air or unfurl a landing flap to guide the box to the ground . The process seems a bit convoluted , but it does make sense for Amazon drones to stay aloft . It would save time and power if the drone did n't have to land and take off with every delivery , and help eliminate the chance of any drone vs customer unpleasantness . The flip side is that now you have packages falling from the sky , although the parachutes and other measures would – hopefully – prevent Amazon-labeled parcels from crash-landing all over the place . In December , Amazon completed its first Prime Air drone delivery in the UK , and though trials are extremely limited right now , Amazon plans to expand deliveries before long , and possibly to more regions . Despite the progress , though , there are huge obstacles standing in the way of full-blown drone deliveries , including government regulations and safety concerns over flying in populated areas . Amazon seems to be working out the best way to make drone deliveries a reality – and the good news is it 's not jumping without a parachute . Via The Verge

A lot of our LG G6 information comes from LG itself , and today ’ s news is no different , as the company has just released a teaser suggesting the phone could have a new generation of AI assistant on board . The teaser , obtained by ZDNet , reads “ Less artificial . More intelligence . The next generation smartphone , brought to you first by LG . ” That doesn ’ t give much away , but of course the mention of artificial intelligence certainly suggests that a notable one will be included . The most obvious choice is Google Assistant , as it ’ s already been rumored that the LG G6 will use Google ’ s upgraded AI . But Amazon ’ s Alexa is possible too , especially as LG has already used that in other ( non-phone ) devices . Yet neither of those would quite line up with LG ’ s claim of bringing it first – the G6 could be the first non-Pixel phone with Google Assistant , but it wouldn ’ t be the first smartphone , and the Huawei Mate 9 has beaten it to the Alexa punch . That leaves three possibilities that we can see , assuming we ’ re not reading too much into LG ’ s wording . One is that whatever AI the G6 uses is only part of what makes it “ the next generation smartphone ” , and it ’ s the whole package that LG is doing “ first . ” Or , it could be that LG will pack in both Google Assistant and Alexa – it would certainly be the first to do that . A final possibility is that LG could be working on its own AI , much like Samsung is doing with Bixby for the Samsung Galaxy S8 , though we suspect this would have been leaked by now if that was the case . They ’ re all intriguing options though , and we ’ ll know which is right soon , as the LG G6 is being unveiled on February 26 .

We ’ ve had great fun using Amazon Echo at home , but now you can bring the clever voice assistant into your vehicle with the Logitech ZeroTouch . The ZeroTouch is a dashboard and air-vent mount for your Android smartphone ( sorry iPhone owners ) that allows you to use the Alexa voice assistant when driving . While the mounts are required to use Alexa in-car , all the work is done by the free ZeroTouch app on your phone – in short , the mount just unlocks the capabilities of the application . To interact with Alexa all you need to do is hold your hand over the front of your phone to trigger the assistant . From there you can ask it the same things as you would with Amazon Echo at home . That means up to the minute traffic reports , news bulletins and if the kids are misbehaving in the back you can always ask Alexa to “ open the magic door ” to keep them occupied with a choose your own adventure . The ZeroTouch app also integrates with core smartphone functions including texts , calls , music and navigation – allowing you to control all of these with your voice . The Zerotouch air vent mount will cost you $ 59.99 ( £49.99 ) , while the bulkier dashboard mount comes in at $ 79.99 ( £59.99 ) - which feels a little expensive for a simple car mount , but it 's the technology in the app that you 're really paying for . For those with iPhones , Logitech tells us that it is working on an app for you - so stay tuned !

When Amazon eventually opens its chain of high-tech supermarkets , it ’ s possible they ’ ll be staffed by as few as three humans according to a recent report by The New York Post . We ’ ve known for a while that Amazon was planning to make a move into brick and mortar stores after it opened the doors of its 1800 square foot Amazon Go grocery store in Seattle . Though the store is currently only open to Amazon employees and is acting as a prototype , The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon is planning to let customers in later this year and open more than 2,000 more stores in the future . According to The Post , some of these stores the online retailer is considering opening will be much larger two-storey supermarkets which could be anywhere between 10,000 and 40,000 square feet . The top floor of these larger stores would be populated by robot staff members who would pick up items for shoppers and bag them . The bottom floor , meanwhile , would be dedicated to allowing customers to shop for thousands of items that we traditionally prefer to touch and see before we buy such as vegetables , meat , and dairy as well as other more grab-and-go items . Both the smaller grocery stores and larger supermarkets won ’ t have queues or cash registers or , most significantly , cashiers . Instead customers would simply use an app on their phones to detect which groceries they ’ ve picked from shelves and then purchase them . Amazon clearly intends the increased automation made possible by technology to result in increased convenience for customers . However , a source close to the matter also reportedly informed the post that “ Amazon will utilize technology to minimize labor . ” In fact , apparently even Amazon ’ s larger stores will be able to operate smoothly with as few as three human employees with sources telling The New York Post that the plan is to have a maximum of ten employees on shift per location . The staff that work there would be expected to perform duties such as signing customers up to the Amazon Fresh grocery service ; restocking shelves on the ground floor ; working at drive-thru windows for customers picking up their groceries quickly ; and helping the robots upstairs to pack bags that will then be sent down to customers . Using robot staff isn ’ t exactly a new thing for Amazon – the company already uses robots in its warehouses and at the Super Bowl its adverts highlighted its plans to start using delivery drones . That said , this report comes alongside recent estimations by think-tank Reform that AI could eliminate 250,000 public sector jobs in the next 15 years . Naturally the prospect of such total automation and the job losses it could bring is concerning to those that work in the retail sector , similar to the concerns of those who fear the impact of the relentless advance of self-driving technology . Though cutting labor costs would lead to profit margins not before seen in the grocery industry , the cost to those who would lose their employment has to be reinforced and responsibility shouldered . The New York Post said that the sources close to the matter cautioned that the early prototype plans for the store had not been confirmed just yet , and when contacted Amazon denied that it had any plans to build a robot-driven supermarket chain . An official Amazon spokesperson told TechRadar that as they told The New York Post `` we have not plans to build such a store and their story is incorrect . ''

Alexa , the voice assistant which can be found inside the Amazon Echo and Amazon Echo Dot , has quickly grown to be one of our favourite smart assistants , beating out the likes of Google ’ s Assistant and Apple ’ s Siri . Part of this has to do with Alexa ’ s ever-growing list of ‘ skills ’ , which act as the equivalent of apps for the device . Now a classic MMORPG series is coming to the device in the form of Runescape , which you might remember as the free browser-based RPG . In its new iteration the Jagex-developed game , called Runescape Quests : One Piercing Note , will be an audio adventure which is apparently based on a single quest from the original game . This isn ’ t the first audio adventure to come to the device . A previous game , called The Magic Door , is an interactive adventure that you control with your voice . The game is structured like a traditional text-based RPG , where you give instructions as to how to proceed based on descriptions on your environment . A series with the history of Runescape has the potential to provide a rich gameplay experience , but at present Amazon does not allow developers to charge for skills on its app store . This may change in the future as skills become more mainstream , but for now at least Alexa 's Runescape game will act as a promotional item only , rather than a product in its own right . Runescape Quests : One Piercing Note is available from today .

One of the best things about today ? Stuff just works . Consider the hours you once spent tapping your pen to the tune of broadband dial-up . And what about blowing on your Sega cartridge to get the game to load ? These are a thing of the past . Read more : Trint Nowadays , super-smart digital devices line our pockets . They ’ re practical , adaptable , our own personal portals that transport us instantly to anywhere our hearts desire . One minute you ’ re reconnecting with long-lost friends on Facebook , the next you ’ re perusing the Etsy marketplace , and then onto booking a last-minute trip to the Costa del Sol . What a time to be alive . But are things really that perfect ? The answer is no . At least , not yet . Think of the volume of complaints ticketing companies receive every year when hopeful festival-goers lose out due to website crashes . However , as long as the highs outweigh the lows , consumers are remarkably forgiving when browsing online . They get over the disappointment of shoes missed out on , gigs unattended , and quickly move on to their next thrill . When it comes to website hosting , businesses are also relatively indifferent . Unless they work in the field , very few have an interest in what happens to keep their site afloat . Broadly speaking , businesses just want things to run smoothly and their customers to be happy . Typically , they find a suitable hosting company , probably via a rudimentary Google search , sign a Service Level Agreement ( SLA ) and that ’ s that . What businesses usually don ’ t realise is that built into the vast majority of these hosting agreements is a magic number . Uptime – the total amount of time a website is live across a given period – is traditionally set at 99.9 per cent . That means website downtime – the period when a website crashes , stopping people from logging on – is essentially a given . 0.1 per cent of the time , it ’ s fine to be offline . This figure doesn ’ t seem like a lot . Besides , what ’ s a glitch here and there ? This common sentiment , which so many businesses must share given they sign these agreements , is what makes the furore over a recent outage at Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) all the more surprising . AWS is one of the world ’ s largest providers of cloud services and is critical to many online businesses . When its S3 storage solution went down due to “ high error rates ” in its Northern Virginia data centres , the likes of Airbnb , Business Insider and Netflix were among those to experience poor performance or total failure . As businesses were left in the dark , the press went into overdrive . How could such a figurehead of online prowess have let this happen ? What many critics don ’ t realize is that Amazon has functionality within its estate to engineer around this sort of issue . For example , many other businesses were impacted by this outage because they had deployed their services into a single Amazon “ region ” , contrary to recommendation . Often customers choose not to opt into certain website hosting services on grounds of cost or that they just did not know they existed . Therein lies the rub . Although hosting clients are starting to get more of a handle on SLAs , detail often goes unexplained . AWS SLAs , for instance , work quite differently to other hosting companies – in that they have different agreements depending on the specific components , such as web server , storage and database – which goes to show how complicated they can be . Businesses need a helping hand to understand what they are buying into . Think about it . For companies that do operate on a standard SLA set-up , the 0.1 per cent of “ allowed ” downtime really equates to 43 minutes per month , or nearly nine hours per year . Imagine if that downtime occurred for a high-street retailer during Black Friday or Boxing Day sales , or for a travel company at peak holiday booking season . According to Statista , total UK ecommerce revenues over the next five years are predicted to be £440,772 billion . Against current SLA standard downtime , that means more than £440 billion of sales revenue being risked during the same period . For big businesses , the cost of downtime is potentially massive . For small online businesses , it could be a deal-breaker . The AWS glitch caused problems for many online businesses , but it was also a necessary evil – it put the value of good web hosting in the spotlight . Losing money is one obvious consequence of downtime . However , businesses also need to think about the negative impact on their brands . We recently conducted a study of 1,000 UK consumers to better understand what happens during downtime . 68 per cent of people said their opinion of a brand would be negatively impacted if its ecommerce platform crashed , while 37 per cent would avoid buying from a brand because of downtime . Perhaps more worryingly , 45 per cent of respondents reported having been shut out of a website they were planning on purchasing from during the week before they were polled . Suddenly , downtime appears rife . For brands that don ’ t take necessary precautions , such as choosing a web hosting partner that can educate on the real cost of downtime , it is a risky business . After all , as the saying goes , it takes a lifetime to build a reputation and only a few seconds to destroy one . This might not ring true for every company . But what if Twitter , which is relied on by millions as a platform to engage with the world , crashed during a major election . In the UK , conversation around online voting is gathering momentum . Imagine if the platform went down at the crucial time . Like it or not , our future is digital . More and more businesses will need an online presence – and a strong web hosting infrastructure to support it . Glitches like AWS ’ are par for the course as we continue towards a world where everything just works – but they also point to a pressing need to better educate people about the technology underpinning their businesses . When it comes to web hosting , a stitch in time really does save nine .
Google Home is among the most interesting of the search king 's current hardware offerings , not least because it sets the stage for an epic showdown between two tech giants . What is Google Home ? Put simply it 's a smart speaker , but one that 's aimed at pulling together the big G 's smart home and audio visual offerings , both past and present . Not only that , it also draws from Google 's formidable experience in search to offer information when you want it , where you want it . Google , however , is n't alone in offering a smart speaker : the Amazon Echo has taken off as a way to interact with the smart home and beyond . Echo has sold surprisingly well , and even spurred a whole line of Echo-compatible products . As good as Echo is , we think the new kid on the block stands a good chance of silencing its reign . Here are five reasons we think Google Home is the product to dethrone the mighty Echo . Amazon 's ecosystem is growing , but it 's nothing like Google 's just yet . Google has come a long way since it started as a humble search engine , and it now offers a multitude of products and services primed to work with Home . Many of those , unsurprisingly , live on the internet . This connectivity makes it easy for Home to access services you use regularly , such Calendar , Contacts , and Play Music . If you 're an avid Android user , you 're already plugged into the Google ecosystem , and Home is just another way to tap into some of Google 's most-used services . It is , some would argue , even easier because you can use your voice to do so . Amazon Echo does work with Google Calendar , but its functionality is limited , and Google is likely to ensure that all of its products play nice together , just like they do , to an extent , with Google Now on Android . Amazon ai n't no search giant , that 's for sure . Google was built as a hub of information - nearly all freely available information in the world is accessible with a quick search thanks to the G team . Google 's had a voice assistant for some time , activated with the simple `` OK , Google '' command . Google Now is often hailed as an excellent voice assistant , however it 's taken a back seat to the more widely publicized Siri . Thanks to search and voice , Google Home has an advantage when it comes to smarts . Sure , Amazon Echo has the technology behind it , but it does n't have the data . Google possess almost two decades worth of information-gathering prowess to back its assistant up , which is sure to show with Google Home . Google 's new voice-controlled assistant , aptly called Google Assistant , will draw from the company 's past experience in recognizing the human voice . Not only does it understand language , but it also picks up context . By tapping into its contextual understanding , Google Assistant can figure out what you mean in a grammatically ambiguous request . This will save you time and breath in having to repeat the same words over and over again , plus get you information more readily . This might not be a big deal for some , but for others bringing a new device into their home that does n't match the decor is a deal breaker . Customization is n't going to be the feature to win me over , but as we expect more personal options with our tech ( take the Moto X and new Live Cases for Nexus phones , for example ) , it will increasingly become the norm . Google Home is no exception . Just what can you customize on your Google Home ? Well , it 's not much , but it 's something . With Home , you can change out the base of the device to different colors and designs . Or , you could give it the Apple treatment and keep the sleek white look that it comes with . Amazon Echo comes in one shade , and while its design is no doubt sleek , it does n't have the same personalization options that Google Home offers buyers . The Amazon Echo may be a great device , but you 'd better put it in the room you spend the most time in as you ca n't , for example , sync multiple Echo devices to play the same song throughout the house . Google Home , however , draws from Google 's already stellar smart media offerings and lets you connect the device to Google Chromecast-based speakers , so you can listen to audio throughout your abode . Google Home does n't quite have a better native speaker than Amazon Echo , but one thing is for sure : by connecting with Chromecast audio , you can open your Home to a range of hi-fi speakers . Perhaps more importantly than music though is the fact that Home connects to your wider smart home , namely Nest and Works with Nest devices . Not only can you control your smart thermostat with the little speaker , but you can also connect to your lighting , locks , and other smart home amenities . Google is constantly adding new Works with Nest products , so the list is growing all the time . Amazon did team up with Samsung to offer SmartThings control to Echo and the Philips 's Hue lighting system , but it 's still in the early stages of broadening its friend list . Even though it 's been on the scene for longer , Echo has a long way to go before it can catch up with all the devices Google already has at its fingertips . As I 've mentioned , Google Home will work well with Works with Nest products , but it looks as though Google is poised have as many other companies sync up with its voice platform as it can . Even at its original launch event , Google was keen to talk up the amount of companies it was going to work with , with a splash screen that included TicketMaster , WhatsApp , Pandora , GrubHub , Instacart , OpenTablet , Uber and Spotify . Amazon Echo , meanwhile , is growing its list of compatible apps , including Domino 's Pizza , Uber and 1-800 Flowers , but the sheer might of Google may have already tipped the scale in Home 's favor . It will likely be a race to see who can sign up the most third-party apps with the most worthwhile functionality going forward , but both are keen to have their speakers performing as many tasks as possible . While we 'll just have to wait to see which smart speaker comes out on top in the long run . Amazon undoubtedly has a head-start , but Google Home has the might of the world 's biggest search giant behind it . The Echo laid the groundwork for home assistants , but Google is ready to swoop in and do what it does best : serve up information and manage your digital life . Home is also slightly more affordable , too , which is another notch in its belt against Echo . Just do n't expect to be able to order products from Amazon on Home . That 's one strike Google 's smart speaker has against it .

Seattle-based e-commerce giant Amazon is looking at expanding its physical presence with appliances , furniture , and potentially electronics , and is considering using VR or augmented reality tech to help customers visualize their products , according to a report by The New York Times . After having rather successfully dominated the US and UK online retail scene , Amazon has begun encroaching on the very market it threatened to push into near-redundancy : retail in the real world . With plans for sci-fi-style supermarkets in the works , and a prototype already established , it looks like furniture , home appliances , and maybe electronics are next on the company ’ s bricks-and-mortar agenda . An anonymous source privy to recent Amazon discussion has told The New York Times that the proposed new stores would act as showcases , giving you the chance to test out any larger purchases before ordering them online . As part of this concept , the use of AR or VR to help aesthetically and spatially place these products in your own home is being considered . [ Image courtesy of Oyundari Zorigtbaatar ]

Planning a supremely lazy , gon na -lay-in-bed-and-not-leave-the-house day ? Amazon is making it easier than ever with its latest voice-activated Alexa assistant features for its Amazon Echo devices . It 's today switching on the ability to make Prime Now orders through voice commands alone . Available to Amazon Prime subscribers , Prime Now delivers thousands of household items as quickly as two hours after an order was placed for a premium delivery fee . Whether you 're too ill to head to a chemist for some cold and flu medicine , or running dangerously low on snacks ahead of a party night , you can now have them brought straight to your door in a couple of hours , just by speaking to your smart speaker . Making use of the new feature is as simple as saying “ Alexa , order [ product ] from Prime Now ” to your Alexa-enabled device , which also includes the Amazon Tap , Fire Tablet , and Fire TV gadgets . And , for the lucky , hard-drinking few stateside in Seattle , Washington all manner of booze available through Amazon Prime Now can be ordered , while beer and wine are available in Columbus and Cincinnati , Ohio . A wider liquor roll-out around the world is not mentioned by Amazon , but youngsters looking to game the system are out of luck – you 'll still need to show valid ID on delivery of the booze .

While Amazon 's Alexa is a well-known component of the retail giant 's Echo smart speakers , the digital assistant is branching out to everywhere from cars to Motorola phones . Before all that , however , Amazon is taking Alexa to iOS as the chirpy AI integrates with Apple 's mobile devices in the latest version of Amazon 's app . Getting Alexa to chime in is as simple as hitting the microphone button on the search bar at the top of the screen . Despite being part of a shopping app , Alexa can do a lot more than order the occasional Wish List splurge . Alexa on the Amazon app works much like its smart speaker counterpart , with the ability to track past orders , look up best-selling items , tell a joke , check weather and news , stream tunes via Prime Music , find your latest Kindle ebook purchase , and a whole suite of other skills . Though iOS and Android both have their own companion apps for Alexa , the updated Amazon app allows Alexa to function on a smartphone on its own without relying on any additional devices . That said , the Amazon app still needs to be installed and running for the feature to work , and is n't built-in like iOS ' own Siri assistant ( or the upcoming Huawei Mate 9 , which is getting a special model just for Alexa functionality ) . Alexa support for iOS rolls out today and is expected to hit all users in the US by the end of the week . An Amazon representative tells us that an Android version is also in the works .

Amazon 's Alexa voice assistant , built into its Amazon Echo products and numerous home helpers and third party speakers , can do everything from control your home lighting to your Spotify playlists . Now , it can add another arrow to its quiver – cleaning . Well , at least indirectly . Connected robot vacuum cleaners by iRobot , such as the iRobot Roomba 980 , will soon be able to take Alexa voice commands to trigger a cleaning cycle . Simply say `` Alexa , ask Roomba to start cleaning '' , and the dust-munching R2-D2s will start digging into your carpets . It 's not a huge amount of control being offered – other Alexa commands merely let you pause or completely stop a cleaning cycle . But it 's a step closer to the completely connected home dream . iRobot is also taking a page out of Dyson 's book , offering Roomba owners a map of the areas that their droid has cleaned up over the last 10 cycles . The update to the iRobot HOME App will be rolling out to Android and iOS users immediately . As for the Alexa commands , they 're going to be ( as you 'd expect ) exclusive to iRobot 's web connected models , like the 900 Series . A bit more frustrating though is that the Alexa integration will , for the time being at least , be a US-only feature . Expect to see that update coming in the second quarter of 2017 .

At this year ’ s Consumer Electronics Show it felt like Amazon ’ s voice assistant Alexa was being integrated into everything . Now one tech fan has taken things even further by turning Alexa into a talking skull . It 's more alarming than the Amazon Echo , that 's for sure . As part of what he calls the Yorick project , computer and robotics hobbyist Mike McGurrin used an old Halloween decoration to transform Amazon ’ s personal assistant and detailed the process in his blog . The blog describes how McGurrin used a 3-axis talking skull with moving eyes that had been a gift from his wife and combined it with a Raspberry Pi and the AlexaPi software to bring the skeletal personal assistant to life . We ’ ve seen Alexa integrated into everything from smartphones to fridges to alarm clocks , but McGurrin says his project was inspired by a hack which put the Alexa technology into an animatronic singing fish . “ When I saw the Alexa Billy Bass I knew what I had to do , and the Yorick project was born . I ’ m pretty happy with the result ” he said . We ’ re not sure how this particular skull would go down in a performance of Hamlet , but it just goes to show the sheer number of household items ( if you can categorize an animatronic skull as a household item ) Amazon ’ s technology can work with . You can see the skull in action below . We did always want to have our very own Murray from Monkey Island ... but now we 're not so sure .

Amazon has reportedly made another acquisition to build up its communications service , Chime , by snagging a startup by the name of Do.com . Chime is a part of AWS and it offers extensive videoconferencing capabilities and a cloud-based platform for organising and holding meetings . Do.com would further bolster this real-time comms offering , as the startup ’ s web and mobile apps were focused on helping organise meetings , and the management of all manner of elements around them – for example prep notes , facilitating reports for non-attendees and so forth . Note that this move was spotted by TechCrunch , and has far from been confirmed by Amazon . Indeed , Do.com has seemingly made moves to hide all the evidence that the tech site uncovered pointing to the deal . That includes a Do.com blog post which announced the closure of the whole service following an acquisition by an unspecified firm – in fact the entire blog site has been taken down – and various LinkedIn staff profiles that indicate Do.com employees are now working on Chime . Plus the company ’ s LinkedIn entry itself , which stated : ‘ Now a part of Amazon Chime . ’ All those references have been removed since TechCrunch published its report and contacted Amazon for a comment , which the company declined to offer . TechCrunch further notes that it couldn ’ t ever get a confirmation from Amazon about the previous acquisition of Biba for the core videoconferencing element of Chime – although that startup ’ s website now clearly states : ‘ Biba has been replaced by Amazon Chime. ’ And the site simply links through to the AWS Chime page . So it would certainly seem that big things are planned for Chime in terms of tackling rivals like Google Hangouts , Slack or indeed Microsoft Teams – which is n't officially out yet , but launches next week – but Amazon simply doesn ’ t want to talk about it . Not yet , anyway . Image credit : TechCrunch

Welcome to the new age of gaming . Our days of sitting in front of the TV , controller in hand might not be numbered – that core gaming experience will still exist – but they could soon be heavily reduced . The types of games we play are always evolving , but now , more than ever , where and how we play them is changing too . We 're not just talking about the growth of mobile titles , the recent introduction of the Nintendo Switch or the inescapable rise of VR though – we could all be about to put down our consoles , controllers and headsets , and instead turn the world around us into a game , using our voices . Confused ? Don ’ t be . The Amazon Echo , the online giant ’ s connected smart speaker that 's taken US and UK homes by storm , is getting in on the gaming act . With the firm ’ s brilliant digital assistant , Alexa , at its core , Amazon is building on the Echo ’ s entertainment efforts , taking the device beyond its ability to control everything from your heating and lighting to your taxi requests and pizza orders with just a vocal cue . The first voice-controlled Alexa games having started to drop – and experts have suggested that this is just the start . “ As the technology grows , and Alexa has a greater capacity to learn from the user , the games and experiences that Echo can provide will get a lot more complex , deeper and a lot more specific to the user , ” says Mark Ogilvie , Design Director for RuneScape . While voice elements within the gaming realm are nothing new , they 're usually limited to devices , rather than the games themselves – you can , for example , turn your Xbox One on and off , and eject disks , using voice commands . Alexa and the Amazon Echo ( not forgetting the Amazon Echo Dot ) are changing this , however , putting vocal cues front and centre ; however , well as opening up vast new channels of gaming possibilities , this also creates its own challenges for game developers . “ Usually you ’ re trying to assault all the senses of your player . You ’ re trying to give them a deeply engaging visual experience , and that ’ s something that wasn ’ t on offer to us here , ” Ogilvie , who brought RuneScape , the world 's largest MMORPG to the Echo , told us . “ We didn ’ t want the experience on the Amazon device to be a passenger experience . You need to make sure that your character is the hero and they ’ re guiding the action , and that was a lot more difficult to imagine with an audio-only experience . ” Despite these new challenges , Ogilvie predicts that the possibilities for vocal gaming brought on by the connected Echo will ultimately outweigh the negatives , and we ’ ll see a widespread rise in voice-activated games . “ There ’ s a lot of potential that lives right now in the device , ” he adds . “ You can ask Alexa a question and she goes off and searches the internet – you can imagine that being part of a game , where you use the depth of knowledge she has via access to the internet to create a meaningful experience for the player . ” Fortunately , Amazon is getting on board , and in a big way , confirming to TechRadar that it not only sees gaming as a viable future for the Echo and Alexa , but that it 's actively working with developers to accelerate its evolution . “ We ’ ve seen a ton of activity around games and the way people are looking to get more entertainment with Alexa , ” Daren Gill , head of Alexa product development at Amazon , told us . “ We look at mobile apps , how games could be incorporated into the small screen , and now we ’ re looking into the future at how using voice and a voice interface could open up new experiences . “ We have thousands of developers that are working on the skills [ Amazon 's version of apps that enable services to work wit Alexa ] , so at any one time there is a pipeline of [ games ] being made ready , and others that are coming out every day . ”

Amazon is pushing its virtual assistant on the productivity front , with the firm announcing that its Alexa-driven devices will now support Office 365 calendars . As TechCrunch reports , Alexa – the assistant which powers Amazon ’ s Echo and Echo Dot speakers – has already benefited from integration with Outlook and Google calendars , but the move to Office 365 shows that Amazon literally means business here . Commercial customers who subscribe to Office 365 with Exchange Online will now be able to go into the Alexa app and link their calendar up to the virtual assistant . Going forward , they will then be able to query Alexa on appointments , give instructions to add items to the calendar , and all the usual stuff you ’ d expect . Clearly , Amazon believes that its speakers are about more than just the smart home , but also the smart office ( and as we saw last month , there ’ s a nifty little invention to let you use Alexa in your car , as well – pretty soon she ’ ll be all over the place ) . We can expect the virtual assistant to get more productivity-related chops in the future , no doubt . And perhaps , as we suggested in our feature on services that need Alexa adding into the mix , Skype support will be coming at some point – after all , Echo would be the perfect medium for making convenient calls .

Smart speakers have taken the consumer tech world by storm , but there 's still a sense they lack enough functionality for users to treat them like everyday devices . While great for those times when you have a random recipe question or want to play music , is that all these digital home helpers really have to offer ? Amazon seems to be aware that smart home products running its Alexa digital assistant must to do more to have long-term success . To that end , a new report from Recode says the ecommerce giant is readying at least one new device that not only taps into Alexa , but also makes voice phone calls . This functionality was reported on previously , but Recode says it 's learned Amazon is moving forward with product release plans . The report cites multiple sources , and not only do they point to the new voice calling feature , but apparently users will also be able to hold two-way intercom conversations with someone on the other end of an Alexa-enabled device . Amazon 's hardware is said have been in the beta testing , and an official announcement of the product or products could take place in the coming months , sources said . What 's unclear is whether Amazon is introducing brand-new devices that feature voice calling and intercom functionality , or if it 's planning an update to its existing Echo speaker line that includes these features . Whatever Amazon does , it will put plenty of pressure on Google Home , Amazon Echo 's biggest competitor in the smart speaker space . Google is also rumored to be working on voice calling for the Home , but will Amazon beat its rival to the punch ? For its part , Google Home might add the ability to recognize different users by the sound of their voices , if recently spotted code leads to a full-blown feature . Amazon , too , is reportedly working on voice print identification for the Echo and Echo Dot . Amazon 's ambitions do n't end there ; Recode says the company has held internal discussions about an Alexa device equipped with a video camera as well . The two top dogs in the smart speaker game are clearly looking to one-up each other with new functions , all the while keeping users engaged with their devices . When and how well either company pulls off these features we do n't yet know , but we get the sense it wo n't be much longer until we find out .

There was a time when Amazon was just the place you would buy DVD and Blu-rays , purchase music albums , and maybe some new batches of video games . But now , not only does Amazon sell all of those things , it 's actually in the business of producing all of them , too . Over the last five years , Amazon has expanded from just being an online marketplace to a producer and creator of original film , television , and , most importantly , games . So how 's the one-time book seller going to rival the likes of Microsoft , Sony and Nintendo ? The answers , according to Vice President of Amazon Games Mike Frazzini , are Twitch and its new game engine , Lumberyard . At GDC 2017 , we spoke with Frazzini about the new name in game publishing where he elaborated on the recent expansions into AAA games , the Lumberyard games engine , and how the Twitch acquisition has paid several fold . `` It 's been fun to see our growth , ” said the Vice President of Amazon Game Studios . “ So much of it is execution , and time , and then to come to GDC and see things come together like this , and to get feedback from our customers has been extremely fun . '' `` There 's a lot research we do to determine whether it 'll enjoyable and be fun to watch . ” GDC , as it turned out , served as a great example of this growth : Amazon ’ s booth expanded immensely in the last few years at the show from a small little cube on the sides to one of the show 's main attractions . In its booth space this year was Twitch , Lumberyard , and their first true AA title , Breakaway , an online brawler with MOBA aesthetics . `` When you look across all of our business , Twitch is now a huge part of it – we 're very inspired by our broadcasters and by the Twitch community as a whole , '' Frazzini said . `` There 's a lot research we do to determine whether it 'll enjoyable and be fun to watch . ” As the VP of Amazon Game Studios explains , the company spent years listening to player feedback during the creation of these titles , while also making sure that the Twitch community continues to thrive . `` We believe very strongly in that games are all about communities , and that the number of ways to participate in them is expanding , and the number of people participating is expanding , and us that is a rich and interesting frontier . ” With many of their upcoming games designed around Twitch integration , Amazon Games Studios sees it as being the new thing , much in the way radio and television were the new thing when they were released . An entire of generation of people are growing up with and sticking with online entertainment , and the developers behind the next wave of games from Amazon Game Studios plan to utilize Twitch completely . `` It 's always about us learning what the customers want , what are they seeing , yeah , Twitch is spectacular . It 's become a daily part of daily lives . When we bought Twitch , we gave a lot of interviews about it , and we got asked often 'why are you buying Twitch ? ' , '' Frazzini said . It 's an investment decision that Frazzini said has paid back several fold , leading to the studio 's first big title , Breakaway . Breakaway , for those who missed its announcement back towards the end of last year , is an online brawler that feels like a mash up of MOBA style gameplay with basketball . The game is being developed by Amazon Game Studios Orange County , formerly known as Double Helix Games the same team behind Killer Instinct , who were acquired by Amazon to help spearhead the development of more ambitious titles for Amazon . And while Breakaway the title Amazon has hung its hat on , it ’ s not the only one in development by the e-commerce giant : there ’ s a class-based multiplayer action game called Crucible , and New World , a MMO Role-Playing Game set in a fantasy version of a newly colonized North America , with John Smedley of EverQuest fame heading development of it . While these games are different genres , the one core feature connecting them is the built-in integration of Twitch streaming thanks to the integration of Amazon ’ s game engine , Lumberyard . “ The other interesting thing [ about Lumberyard ] is the cloud , it 's got ridiculous amounts of computing and storage capabilities , and when you think about designing games that embrace the cloud and deeply embrace the importance of community , you want to have a tremendous ability for designers and artists to draw from those resources . So for us , it was really easy to make those games , and be successful when it comes to making them . Being in engine , and doing it all natively , it 's the absolute best way to deliver ease of use . '' With Twitch 's popularity exploding in recent years , Amazon views integration into its games as a no-brainer . With this in mind , they designed these particular to play well with their audience , focusing on fast and frenetic gameplay , and also be fun enough to watch others play on their own . `` Twitch has really affected our business . It 's really given us a lot to think about and innovate on . '' “ Another thing is the inclusion of Twitch Prime , that was a major innovation . Amazon Prime was a spectacular value , and to add gamer benefits to it , to allow broadcasters more benefits it was very smart . So Twitch Prime is a way to give consumers a credit to give streamers , at no additional cost . Those are a couple examples of how Twitch has really affected our business , it 's really given us a lot to think about and innovate on . '' Amazon Game Studios certainly has a lot planned out for the future , and it 's got the games to back it up . Breakaway was a fun , raucous time to play , and their next titles sound like they offer something a bit different , yet has enough for players to sink their teeth into . Whether any of it will be enough to carve out a place as a major publisher alongside companies like EA , Activision and 2K , however , remains to be seen .
Head of Amazon , Jeff Bezos , has said he wants to begin delivering packages to the moon in anticipation of the establishment of human settlements there . According to The Washington Post , Bezos has penned a seven page white paper on behalf of his private space travel company Blue Origin which encourages NASA and the Trump administration to back an Amazon-like commercial lunar shipment service . Specifically , his shipment service . By mid-2020 , he thinks Blue Origin could be used to deliver experiment equipment as well as cargo and gear for building habitats to enable “ future human settlement ” on the moon . Bezos stresses , however , that it could “ only be done in partnership with NASA . ” NASA isn ’ t unwilling to work with the commercial sector ; already it ’ s providing technical expertise , though no funding , to SpaceX for its planned uncrewed mission to Mars . Bezos , who owns The Washington Post , told them “ It is time for America to return to the Moon — this time to stay . A permanently inhabited lunar settlement is a difficult and worthy objective . I sense a lot of people are excited about this . ” There has indeed been renewed interest in space tourism to the moon ; SpaceX ’ s Elon Musk recently announced plans to send two private citizens on a trip around the moon as soon as late next year . NASA similarly announced it ’ s considering adding astronauts to the first flight of its Space Launch System . The flight was originally scheduled to circle the moon without humans in 2018 but it may now have a crew for a 2019 mission instead . Unlike SpaceX , Bezos ’ Blue Origin wouldn ’ t be involved in transporting people to the moon – instead its vehicle outlined in the white paper would focus on carrying 10,000 pounds of cargo to the moon ’ s south pole , specifically near the Shackleton Crater . This would be an ideal landing spot for Blue Origin to secure as it has near-continuous sunlight to provide power to the spacecraft ’ s solar arrays . However , it ’ s unclear whether or not a private company has any right to claim any land on the moon just yet , particularly high-value locations like the Shackleton Crater .
Thanks to its Amazon Echo smart speaker Amazon is always listening , and thanks to a leaked upcoming security camera it looks like pretty soon it ’ s going to be always watching as well . The leak comes courtesy of an image unearthed by AFTVnews , which appears to show a camera that looks a little like a taller version of Nest ’ s Indoor Security Camera . The camera pictured has a tall , narrow , cylindrical design , with a small Echo-style blue ring at its bottom . Around the ring are four smaller circles , which The Verge points out could be infrared sensors for night-time recording . No word yet on whether the camera will support Amazon ’ s Alexa voice assistant , or whether it will go further with visual , in addition to auditory , recognition . We have contacted Amazon for comment and will update this piece when they respond .

Amazon have released a set of commands that developers can use to make Alexa , the voice assistant currently found in the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Echo Dot , follow a more speech natural pattern . The way Alexa speaks at the moment sounds pretty human , but there are obvious ‘ tells ’ in the lack of intonation , pitch change and pause that give away that it ’ s an artificial voice . These new commands are designed to make her voice feel more human , report TechCrunch . There are five commands : Whisper , Expletive Beeps , Sub , Emphasis , and Prosody . All of the commands are designed to frame a specific set of words within Alexa ’ s script so she knows which words to apply the command to . Whisper and Expletive Beeps are both fairly self-explanatory , and have easily imaginable ( and pretty funny ) possible uses . Sub is when Alexa should substitute one word for another , so if there is an abbreviation in the written document that Alexa has pulled but it would be unnatural to say the abbreviation , a command can be placed for her to sub in the full word . Emphasis changes the rate and volume at which Alexa speaks the selected words , so if what she is saying is important she can say it slower and louder . Prosody changes the volume , pitch and rate of speech , and is the command with the greatest control , allowing developers to have total control when Alexa ’ s voice raises or lowers , speeds up or slows down , which really opens her up to take pauses for thought , lower her voice for disapproval , raise her voice to sound emotional . The team behind these commands have put certain limits on so that people don ’ t start making ‘ funny squeaky voice ’ Alexa , which is a blessing . We hope these improvements , at the very least , allow Alexa to tell better jokes in future , which was not the case when we filmed her doing so last time ( check out the video below for an example of Alexa 's original joke-telling abilities ) .

Amazon might be ready to overthrow QVC as the best way to buy unnecessary commodities from the comfort of your couch . The Seattle-based company briefly released a new app called Fire TV to the streaming box ’ s app store yesterday that allows users to buy products directly from the Amazon store using their Fire TV and Fire TV Stick . While users did n't have long to view the app on the store , AFTVnews.com grabbed a screenshot of the shopping app 's description that more or less spells out the fact that shopping on Amazon TV is coming very soon : `` With the Amazon TV app , you will be able to enjoy a lean back shopping experience on the largest screen in your house , using just your Fire TV remote . ” But , before you could say “ free two-day shipping ” , the app listing disappeared . So , what are we to make of the Amazon app 's disappearing act ? Well , it means that the Amazon shopping app is still in development . But , perhaps even more interesting is the fact that it 's nearly ready for release . A shopping app on the Amazon Fire TV could help bolster the sales of Amazon 's streaming box and help bring the Fire TV into the Amazon ecosystem . Considering the fact that Amazon Fire TV is still losing the streaming box race to Roku , this might be one of the ways Amazon attracts new customers . Via Cord Cutter News
The Amazon Echo has taken homes by storm , with its Alexa assistant helping you organize your life , keep you updated with the latest news , and dress appropriately for the weather conditions – but that last point is being taken a step further with Amazon ’ s new Echo Look . Echo Look comes equipped with its own camera , with the sole purpose – for now – to take a snap of your outfit each day and then shamelessly judge whether or not it ’ s a good look for you . It ’ s basically a modern day “ hot or not ” that you ’ re being asked to welcome into your home with open arms . It ’ s fair to say then that here at TechRadar , we ’ re not convinced by Amazon ’ s latest Echo installment , and we need some rather important questions answered before we considering revealing the contents of our wardrobe to the Amazon mothership . Privacy is a hot topic , and personal pictures are not images we want freely available to the web . We need to know exactly where the images taken by the Echo Look are stored - be it the cloud , on the device itself , on our smartphones… and secondly , who owns them ? We ’ re taking photos of ourselves , but we ’ re using Amazon ’ s device - if they ’ re directly ported to the cloud via Amazon ’ s services does that give the retailer the rights to use the images elsewhere ? Amazon is encouraging people to install the Echo Look in their bedrooms , and then take a photo of their outfit . But do we really want an internet connected camera in our bedroom , watching us changing our clothes ? We need some assurances over the security of the Look platform , as giving hackers an eye into our boudoir doesn ’ t exactly fill us with confidence - we don ’ t need anyone to tell us how we look naked , let alone some spotty teenager on the other side of the world . Is look really going to be used for just judging your fashion sense ? That seems like a lot of work for one implementation , considering the Alexa platform is based on third party `` Skills '' which are forever adding functionality to Echo devices . But at the same time do we really want third parties to get their hands on the snapper ? It could lead to some rather dubious skills cropping up in the Alexa app and , as we questioned above , who knows where the pictures could end up ... Fashion taste is a very personal thing . From a catwalk curio to a city-smart suit to an outfit tied to a person ’ s cultural heritage , clothing means different things to different people at different times . How will Amazon be able to sensitively make a judgement call on the millions of potential situations and choices that make up a person ’ s wardrobe ? How long before there ’ s a tabloid story of a crash dieter being pushed over the edge by an Amazon Echo Look that refuses to greenlight their outfit ? Or someone in cultural dress being recommended hotpants ? There ’ s the issue of subjective taste too . A fashion student will likely feel very differently about how he or she dresses compared to , say , your average tradesperson or your grandparents . What will Amazon do to make recommendations you won ’ t scoff at , and what will it have to know about each individual to make a suggestion that resonates ? We 'd imagine the amount of data required about a person to make the Echo Look even remotely useful would be startling . You can walk out the door and , even if you live in a busy metropolis , find it incredibly unlikely to spot someone dressed similarly to you . These are lifestyle choices – not simply a decision based on color-coding , or seasonal trends . Devices with cameras are nothing new . They ’ ve been a standard on phones for decades , and on tablets for as long as they ’ ve existed . The original Amazon Echo broke with tradition by being entirely sound-based rather than relying on a screen at all , but with the Amazon Echo Look it feels like the devices are becoming more and more similar to what we ’ ve seen before . I mean come on Elon - we get that you ’ ve done okay with the ladies thus far , but surely you can take some time off from hyperlooping to program your webcam to tell you that your turtleneck is so last year .
Update : After numerous leaks , the Amazon Echo Show has finally been announced . Original story continues below ... After the introduction of the Amazon Echo Look , the online retailer is rumored to be planning the introduction of a screen-equipped Echo device , according to Cnet . Apparently the company has been planning to expand its range for some time , but has accelerated its plans thanks to the rapid development of the Google Home speaker . According to the source , the new device is set to be revealed next month , although the timing could apparently change . Before the announcement of the Amazon Echo Look we would have been skeptical of the idea of a screen-equipped Echo , since the point of Amazon 's smart speakers so far has been to create an entirely auditory experience . If these rumors end up being true , it would see the Echo lineup transitioning from a lineup of smart speakers , to a voice-controlled personal computer range . While the additional functionality could be useful , it also potentially loses what made the Amazon Echo such an interesting product in the first place .

You don ’ t need validation that you ’ re a sharp dresser . You don ’ t . But , on some level , part of you just wants some reassurance that you ’ re ready to face the world looking your best . Tapping into that deep-seated insecurity … uh , desire to look your best , Amazon is releasing a new member of the Echo family called the Echo Look . Part wide-angle camera , part style guru , the Amazon Echo Look snaps a full-length photo of you in the morning , allowing you to see what you look like on your phone , and then uses computer learning to tell you how good you look . How does the Look know the difference between what ’ s hot and what ’ s not ? The Look ’ s depth-sensing camera blurs out the background of the image , focusing on you and the clothes you ’ re wearing . Once it has two pictures of you wearing different outfits , you can submit them to the Style Check algorithm . This takes into account fit , color , styling , and current trends and gives you feedback as to which outfit has more visual pop . If you get the thumbs up , you ’ re ready to go out and conquer the world with your Vogue cover shot-worthy outfit . If not , the Look might refer you to its online store where you can shop for new , Amazon-approved duds . It ’ s not hard to put two and two together here . Amazon owns a fashion section of the website . You might not always feel good about the way you look and want to improve your style . Amazon kills two birds with one stone by providing you with a smart style assistant who just so happens to be tapped into the e-tailer ’ s marketplace full of great-looking clothes . But setting aside the Look ’ s slightly duplicitous nature , it has real potential to be a handy little guide to putting together a unique look each morning . Another advantage of the Look is that when it ’ s not doling out the fashion advice it works just like an Amazon Echo Dot , which means it can tap into other smart home devices or answer queries in between fashion shows . Unfortunately , however , the Amazon Echo Look is only available to VIPs only . Like the launch of the original Echo , Amazon is selling the Look on an invitation-only basis . Should you get the invite , though , the Look will set you back $ 200 ( around £150 , AU $ 270 ) .

No stranger to introducing new products , Amazon has added something different from its regular selection of goods : digital subscriptions . Subscribe with Amazon is the newest addition to the retail giant 's ever-expanding repertoire , offering a way for subscription-supported services to let customers check out directly through Amazon 's website . According to a press release , Subscribe with Amazon will improve visibility by offering a service its own listing on the Amazon site , as well as easy-to-use APIs for conveniently managing a page and offering simple payment plans of the introductory , monthly , and annual variety . What does that mean for customers ? For the regular Amazon shopper , the process of picking up a few months of Consumer Reports or premium Dropbox access is virtually the same as adding anything else to your Amazon cart . Integration with Amazon also means you can manage multiple subscriptions just by checking one site — a boon to those who prefer not having their personal and credit card information spread out over a dozen different online locations . Of course , Amazon is ultimately running a business , so services that go with Subscribe with Amazon will have to fork over 30 % of whatever they make from new subscribers , dropping to 15 % for repeat buyers . Additionally , Subscribe with Amazon also gives the company a chance to increase the value of its own subscription service . Amazon plans to offer special deals via Subscribe with Amazon exclusively for Amazon Prime members , such as a discount on a digital magazine subscription or a free month of online crafts courses . To qualify for selling through Subscribe with Amazon , a service currently has to offer a product via an app , website or software . Second , the business needs to be based in the US . Finally , customers must pay a recurring fee to access the product . This is far from Amazon 's first attempt at doing everything in-house for digital services . The company introduced Amazon Coins back in 2013 as an incentivized , alternative digital currency for buying apps and making in-app purchases , though these are currently exclusive to Amazon Fire devices .
While Google is arguably the leader in advancing self-driving cars for your everyday transportation needs , it looks like another big name is looking at autonomous vehicles for an entirely different purpose . Retail giant Amazon has created its own firm focused on the potential of utilizing driverless technology to improve its service , according to insider sources of The Wall Street Journal . Though Amazon is no stranger to making its own products , as seen with its tablets and set-top boxes , it appears the company 's interest in self-driving tech is more about logistics than commercial sales . Rather than develop its own self-driving vehicle to sell , it look like Amazon 's autonomous driving research team — which was reportedly created over a year ago and consists of about a dozen members — may be researching how to use the tech to lower shipping costs . Similar to the company 's initiative of using drones to deliver packages , Amazon may be researching the benefits of its own self-driving cars to cut the costs of relying on third-party mailing services ( and , ya know , human beings ) to transport packages . Gradually increasing shipping rates has caused some headaches for Amazon , with the online merchant having to raise the cap for free shipping for non-Amazon Prime subscribers early last year before dropping it back to normal in response to growing competition and negative feedback . Should Amazon decide to put a driverless pedal to the metal to deliver orders , it may have its share of options to choose from . In addition to the Google-backed Alphabet division Waymo , it looks like electronics bigwig Apple may actually be working on an autonomous car after all .

Though Google Home and Amazon Echo are primarily intended for use around the house , Mercedes-Benz is looking to use the smart speaker tech for hitting the road . The auto manufacturer announced today that both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa , the digital assistants that power the Home and Echo , respectively , are now compatible with all 2016 and 2017 Mercedes-Benz models in the US . To utilize the new integration , users will need a Mercedes me account and active subscription to mbrace , Mercedes ' car-connected app . Then , they can do everything from start their vehicle to send directions . Once activated , Mercedes owners can interact with their vehicle via voice commands such as , “ OK , Google , tell Mercedes me to start my car , ” or “ Alexa , ask Mercedes me to send an address to the car . '' You can see Google Home functionality with Mercedes-Benz vehicles demonstrated in the video below , as well as a tease at what the tech could do on an Android Wear smartwatch . In addition to digital assistants , Mercedes-Benz also plans to add Apple Watch support for its companion app , integration with Nest and Samsung SmartThings home automation systems , and compatibility with Android Wear over the course of 2017 . Mercedes-Benz is n't the only one making its cars smarter with digital home goods . This year 's CES was chock full of cars merging with new tech , to include Hyundai 's recent addition of Google Assistant to its Blue Link-enabled vehicles .
It looks like Amazon could very well be planning to revolutionize the apparel industry if a recent patent that ’ s been granted and reported by Recode is anything to go by . The patent , which Amazon applied for in 2015 and was granted by the US Patent Office earlier this week , depicts an apparel manufacturing system that would quickly produce items of clothing only after a customer has placed an order . Most online and physical clothing stores operate by manufacturing their clothes in a variety of sizes and colors in advance , selling the stock , and then re-ordering should they require more . With this system , Amazon customers could potentially go online , select a clothing style , color and size after which Amazon ’ s computerized system would be able to create the item of clothing from start-to-finish all in one place and then ship it straight to the customer . The computerized system that Amazon has drawn up would be comprised of everything that ’ s required to manufacture a standard item of clothing with textile printers , cutters , an assembly line and more resources besides . It would also have cameras that would be able to monitor the clothing as it ’ s produced and make sure nothing goes wrong . If anything did go wrong , such as a fabric misprint or incorrect cut , the cameras should feed the error back to the system which would then adjust itself , alert an attendant or discard the item completely . After production the products would be quality checked , packed and shipped . To meet the large number of orders that would be made on time Amazon has designed the prospective system to manufacture items in batches based on customer location , sizes , and fabric types . The patent reads “ By aggregating orders from various geographic locations and coordinating apparel assembly processes on a large scale , the embodiments provide new ways to increase efficiency in apparel manufacturing . ” The patent also notes that this system could be used to produce things other than standard pieces of clothing such as footwear and home items such as bedding and curtains using a wide variety of materials . Amazon isn ’ t exactly new to the apparel industry – the company has a huge selection of clothing on offer and it even has its own clothing brands which include lines for men , women and children . As this system is just a patent it ’ s not clear when or even if such a system and facility will ever be created . The patent also doesn ’ t say whether or not the system would be used to fulfill wholesale orders to businesses or orders made by individual customers . However if it was used for individual customers orders it could completely change the clothing industry and make fast fashion even faster . With such a system , Amazon would be more than capable of responding quickly to trend changes without the worry of being left with large amounts of inventory that would only shift in sales .
Amazon 's Kindle line has an ereader for all bookworms . Cash-strapped ? Pick up the classic touchscreen Kindle . Night owl ? Try the backlit Paperwhite . Want something more premium ? The Oasis is about as good as ereaders get , if you 've got the money . But want to have a read in the bath ? Or the pool ? Unless you 're ready to risk ruining your Kindle with a dunking , end up with soggy paper pages or have bought into the Kobo Aura One 's ecosystem , you 're out of luck . That may be about to change however , as a new leak suggests Amazon 's next Kindle advancement could be waterproofing . An image posted to MobileRead , allegedly from a Chinese retailer , shows a Kindle packing a glass display – which lines up with the needs for a waterproof device . Other than that waterproofing , the photo 's poster says to expect little else to change – you 'll get the same CPU as earlier models , same storage amounts and same 300dpi display . The flush bezel suggests you 're looking at a Kindle Voyage-like design . Suggesting that the new Kindle could be out in the second half of 2017 , we could see the new device potentially as early as June – perfectly timed for beach holiday season . There 's the suggestion however that it 'd also ring the death knell for the Voyage and Oasis Kindles – unsurprising , given their high price tags . You never see them in use on public transport , as an unscientific litmus test . The image above does raise some eyebrows – there 's little context given , and the strangely scrubbed out elements could hide factors that could debunk the rumor . But it 'd be a welcome , useful feature – one that could inspire an upgrade from those happily sticking by their ol ' faithful older devices .

Think you know a lot about smart speakers ? Let ’ s test your knowledge . Only one speaker can connect to your Google account , check your calendar and allow you to add new events . Is that speaker a . ) Google Home or b . ) Amazon Echo ? If you guessed Google Home , you ’ re a logical , intelligent human being . If you guessed Amazon Echo , you ’ re twisted , illogical and , well , also right . In a seriously strange series of events , Amazon recently patched Echo devices to work even better with Google Calendar , now allowing you to not only to check your calendar but to add new events to it , too . This isn ’ t something Google has enabled the Home to do , despite owning the entire end-to-end ecosystem . To create a new event , make sure your Google account is tied to your Echo and simply say “ Alexa , create a new event ” . Alexa will prompt you for the date and time of the event , as well ask for a name to label the event on your calendar . Ask Google Assistant to do the same thing and it responds “ I ’ m sorry , I can ’ t add events to your calendar yet ” . Amazon 1 , Google 0 . While Google Home can ’ t do much with your Google Calendar ( or Gmail , Drive , Docs , Maps , Voice account , Alerts , Chat , Trends or Google Plus ) , it can at least differentiate between different voices – something that Echo currently can ’ t do . While both devices support multiple accounts , Google Home can detect which voice is speaking and tailor results to that person . It also allows you to add up to six accounts on a single device , which is pretty handy in larger households . Still , none of that makes up for the incompatibility its own first-party services – a huge failing , and one we didn ’ t shy away from criticizing when we reviewed the Home a few months ago . But , that being said , Google IO is coming up and it 's likely to hold a few surprises for the Mountain View company 's smart speaker . Via Engadget

Amazon has made it easier than ever to track what your children are doing with its tablets and other devices , with a new feature called Parent Dashboard . This standalone site is an analytics portal for parents that tracks what is being consumed on any device that has Amazon Fire for Kids or Amazon Fire for Kids Unlimited installed ( Amazon FreeTime in the US ) . It logs what apps your child is using , what they are reading at any given time and what they are watching too . The idea is that by knowing just what your children are doing with the tablet , you can spark up conversations about the latest thing they are into and join in the conversation - without having to have an expert 's grasp of Peppa Pig . This is all thanks to a new feature called discussion cards , part of Parent Dashboard . Although they are rather light touch , these digital cards offer up a number of discussion points you can bring up with your child about the book they are reading or program they are watching . Essentially a simplified version of a Letts Notes guide - other revision services are available - you would find in schools , the cards have been designed to prompt discussion and also offer up various activities relating to the prose . Discussion cards are available for videos , books , educational apps , and games within Fire for Kids . Speaking to TechRadar , Kurt Beidler , Director of Kids & Family at Amazon , said about the new Parent Dashboard : `` Parents were telling us that they wanted to participate a bit more with their children . `` It 's great they can trust that the kid is doing good things on the tablet and did n't have to worry that they were doing anything inappropriate . But at the same time , they do n't really know what their children are doing [ with the tablet ] . `` When you ask kids what they are doing there 's usually a lot of one-word answers , so Parent Dashboard is an answer to this . '' When you log into Parent Dashboard , you are presented with a profile of your child , or children - depending how many profiles you have on each device . There you can see how long they have spent on books , videos , apps and the web on any particular day . Click into any of these and it will drill down into the actual thing they have been looking at . From here you can see the discussion cards and other bits of salient information . You can go back as far as 90 days to see if there 's trends in how and what is used on the device . While having this much information on what your child is doing on a tablet may feel rather voyeuristic , Beidler hopes it will encourage openness between parent and child , especially as they start to read on their own . `` Parents with younger kids tend to be reading together so there is already a shared experience , but then kids get to around seven or eight they start to read independently , '' said Beidler . `` Parents are n't reading the same thing as their kids , they do n't really know what the books are about so we 've created discussion cards . `` These are created by an editorial team that offer up a summary of the book and , more importantly , open ended questions that will perhaps get over that one word answer and try to really draw the child into a deeper conversation . `` We are trying to bring parents into the experience , so they can share with the reading experience .

Letting your kids use your gadgets has its benefits and its downsides . Although capable of stopping a tantrum or preventing a strop , your device will likely come back plagued with sticky fingerprints . Oh , and you might have just unwittingly racked up a sizeable bill of in-app purchases too . Well , if you ’ ve experienced this costly problem in the past , you could be able to get your money back , with Amazon confirming it is to refund in-app purchased made by kids . Now , this is n't the giant gesture of goodwill it might first sound like . Instead , it ’ s the culmination of a three-year legal battle between the online retailer and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , a US regulator . The case , which accused Amazon of billing customers for unauthorised in-app purchases made by their children , has now been settled . As a result , Amazon is to make a pool of around $ 70 million ( £56.12m ) available for refunds . “ Consumers affected by Amazon ’ s practices can now be compensated for charges they didn ’ t expect or authorise , ” said Thomas B. Pahl , acting director of the FTC ’ s Bureau of Consumer Protection . As a result of the ruling , if you were charged for an in-app purchase made by your kids between November 2011 and May 2016 , you could now be eligible for a refund . Amazon , however , has yet to offer up details on the refund program and how you ’ ll be able to claim back money owed to you . The Amazon App Store can be added to a number of Android devices and comes pre-installed on the company ’ s own Amazon Fire tablets . Although all app platforms offer in-app purchases , parents had complained that Amazon ’ s service made it too easy for children to make digital purchases without their consent . Amazon isn ’ t the only one to have been hit by such a case , however . Back in 2014 , both Apple and Google settled similar cases with the FTC . They seemed to get off a bit lighter , however , with combined refunds amounting to $ 51 million . According to the FTC , Amazon takes a 30 % cut of all apps sold through its digital store . For now this is a US-based ruling , but the result could have implications for customers in the UK and Europe . Via The Verge

Not feeling confident giving out your credit card information to do a little online shopping ? Amazon is making it easier to pay for goods online using cold , hard cash . The digital retail giant is rolling out Amazon Cash — a way to build up your Amazon Balance using physical tender just by visiting brick-and-mortar stores . Armed with a unique bar code that can be printed or saved to a phone , Amazon users can now load up their Amazon accounts with a single in-store transaction at participating shops such as CVS , Speedway , Sheetz , Kum & Go , D & W Fresh Market and more . The system is n't unlike purchasing a gift card to use on your Amazon account , a common practice for those who 'd rather not use their debit information online or minors without a bank account . In fact , money added to a user 's Amazon Balance using Amazon Cash is automatically pooled together with their Gift Card Balance . Essentially , the main difference between self-gifting cards and Amazon Cash is that Cash is more efficient , with funds going to your Amazon account immediately after purchase and presumably producing less waste . In addition to desktop shoppers , iOS and Android users can access their Amazon Cash barcode via the official Amazon app . Currently , the program is available in the US at a select number of grocery and drug stores , though Amazon says more retailers are expected to join in soon .

Just imagine it – you ’ re lying in the park on a roasting hot day and you see it . A shadow overhead . Is it superman ? Is it rain ? No , it ’ s your Amazon Prime ice lolly order being gently parachuted down to your location via drone in your time of lazy need . This is a scenario that could very well be on the drone-populated horizon if a recent patent granted to Amazon is anything to go by . Issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office , the patent depicts a shipping label fitted with built-in parachutes . The idea is that the shipping label would house a series of cords , a parachute , a breakaway cover and a harness to keep everything in place . The patent also depicts several sensors to make sure the delivery is landing in the correct area as well as a shock absorber to keep the package secure both when the parachute is deployed and just in case it ends up coming to Earth with a force more akin to a hailstone than a snowflake . Naturally , it ’ d be easy to adapt the size or number of parachutes used to support a variety of package sizes and weights . Considering Amazon is getting fairly serious in its push for deliveries via drone , the use of parachutes isn ’ t too hard to imagine . We saw the first Prime Air delivery take place in the UK all the way back in December 2016 with another demonstration taking place in the US in March . Considering legislation limitations , Amazon are moving along surprisingly quickly . The use of parachutes arguably makes a lot of sense as it could make it possible for drones to deliver in areas where it ’ s not possible to have landing pads , or where the drones are restricted to maintaining certain heights . Adverse weather conditions are no doubt something to consider ; it ’ d be less than ideal to make a light order on a windy day and find yourself scaling a tree to retrieve it . Despite the fact that the drone will apparently not be able to fly back to the deployment center until it knows the package has been delivered safely to the ground , it 's hard to imagine what it 'd be capable of doing in the aforementioned scenario other than hover in a panicked manner . This is , however , just a patent ( one of many Amazon has filed as part of its exploration of drone delivery possibilities which have genuinely included airborne fulfillment centers ) so there ’ s no guarantee we ’ ll ever see it become a reality .

From Andy Rubin , the creator of Android , comes a new smart speaker called Essential Home . It looks like a cross between an Amazon Echo Dot and a Nest thermostat that wants to get your smart home gadgets talking to one another . The speaker works in a similar way to the Amazon Echo , although it will be equipped with a large circular screen , much like the upcoming Amazon Echo Show . The aim is for the Essential Home to act as a hub for your entire smart home . You can interact with it through both touch and voice , and early images suggest that the speaker is able to control lights , play music , and get responses to various questions . So far , so Amazon Echo , but the interesting thing about the Essential Home is its Ambient OS , which promises to rely on the cloud a lot less than competing devices . As well as being helpful for security , this will hopefully also mean that your whole home won ’ t grind to a halt when you ’ re internet connection is acting up . Another unique feature is that the speaker has a focus on making suggestions rather than directly taking control of your smart home . One example given in a blog post on the company ’ s website is that the speaker will let you know that a light has been left on if your previous routine suggest that it should currently be turned off . Essential isn ’ t the first company to attempt to unify the smart home in this way . The aforementioned Amazon Echo offers integration with numerous smart home devices , and Google offers similar integration via its ‘ Works with Nest ’ and Google Home functionality . Both Apple and Samsung also have their own initiatives in the form of HomeKit and SmartThings , which allow smart home devices from different providers to connect and communicate with each other with varying levels of success , and Apple is also rumored to be working on its own Amazon Echo competitor , a Siri Speaker . With so many smart home companies currently supporting some combination of these services , Essential will have its work cut out if it wants to convince them to integrate with Essential Home and Ambient OS as well . Theres ' no word yet on how much the Essential Home will cost or when it might be available , but hopefully we ’ ll get more details when Rubin takes to the stage at Code later today .

Earlier this week , Amazon added a new feature to its Prime Video service . For an additional fee , you can now add Amazon Channels to your Prime subscription , letting you stream in specialist content from niche providers . Continuing in the same vein as the US launch of the service ( though missing some of that launch ’ s big name options , such as HBO ) , you only pay for the channels you want , and can completely ignore the additional stuff if you like . So far prices range from £1.99 to a £9.49 premium , with programming ranging from pricey fitness channels like Sweatflix to the Discovery channel . It ’ d quickly add up if you bought into every channel , but many offer such niche content that you ’ re likely only going to want to hover around one or two . Some of the providers ( such as HBO in the US ) already have robust streaming services of their own , so you ’ d have to wonder what exactly is the benefit ( beyond scale ) of partnering up with Amazon , especially as there must be some sort of revenue share involved . But for others , it ’ s the best thing that could have happened to them . I ’ m thinking specifically about the BFI , and its BFI Player Plus service . The BFI Player already exists as a web and app service , and offers a mixture of up-to-date paid for rentals alongside the BFI Player Plus subscription service . For £4.99 a month , it also offers up 300 films for unlimited streaming . As far as content libraries go it serves its target audience incredibly well – avoiding the blockbusters that Netflix and Amazon usually fight over , BFI offers up a highly-curated catalogue of indie films , world cinema , cult classics and celluloid curios . It may not be full of CGI spectacle or buddy comedies , but it has the sort of films that movie critics praise highly . The problem is , as a standalone service , the BFI Player is simply awful . I was a subscriber for a few months earlier this year , and I cancelled my subscription as I was so appalled by how broken everything was . And I can never usually be bothered to cancel anything . Its apps barely work , and I even struggled to get the browser-build of the BFI Player to work consistently . So I took my money elsewhere , which was a crying shame . The selection offered by BFI is hard to come by through any other service , with master filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa and Werner Herzog ’ s filmographies well represented . These are the sort of films that are sometimes hard to track down , and as a result it can be pricey to buy physical copies from some retailers . Which makes its arrival on the Amazon Prime player so fantastic . As a bolt on to my subscription , I get all* the great films that the BFI service offers , but with the benefits , bells and whistles of having it housed on Amazon ’ s superior platform . Master filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa and Werner Herzog are well represented . I can support the sort of content I want to see , which is admittedly a bit specialist to expect to find on crowd pleasing Prime-standard or Netflix , without having to jump through hoops to get the bloody things to play . And BFI can get on with what it does best – curating and archiving interesting and important film – while Amazon gets to leverage its technological prowess . Win win . There ’ s always a fear that the Amazon juggernaut will consume all the little guys , until it has an unstoppable monopoly over anything we wish to buy , or view , or listen to . Just look at the struggles booksellers have faced with Amazon ’ s meteoric online bookselling rise . But sometimes you can ’ t help but be grateful for a giant like this . If the alternative is that the BFI Player Plus service is resigned to an early grave , I ’ m happy to put more money into the Amazon machine . *Well , almost all . I ’ ve noticed a few discrepancies between the BFI Player Plus standalone catalogue , and that which is offered through Amazon . Regardless , the selection on offer is still strong – but you ’ d expect identically named , identically priced services to offer identical content . According to a BFI customer service representative I spoke to earlier , this is to be expected . They said : “ The Amazon service is provided by them directly , as such they control the content that is included . So although the content is sourced from the BFI Player Plus , not all of the content is included . ” However , an Amazon spokesperson said that both catalogues should be like for like , so the differences may still be early days teething issues . Amazon is looking into the matter , and I ’ ll update this story when I hear back from the company .

A press release from Ikea has revealed that its TRÅDFRI range of affordable smart lights will be compatible with the voice-controlled Apple HomeKit , Google Home and Amazon Alexa platforms some time in the latter half of the year . The range includes a variety of dimming , sensing , and remote-controlled light fixtures , as well as a hub device called a ‘ Gateway ’ that allows for connectivity with your home ’ s network . Although the other options are semi-smart , the Gateway itself can control your lighting via a dedicated app and will soon support connectivity with other major home assistant devices like thermostats , door locks , ceiling fans and more . Based on the response from the range ’ s announcement , the real boon of the Ikea devices has been their simplicity of use and installation , and relatively cheap price , considering competitors like the Philips HUE charge roughly double for comparable products . So far the Ikea TRÅDFRI range is available in the US and UK but won ’ t be available in Australia until early 2018 .

The internet was abuzz yesterday with the news that Netflix would be producing a TV series based on The Witcher , the franchise that ’ s so far generated three games and eight books . But if you want to enjoy a live-action Witcher film you can do so right now with an Amazon Prime subscription . Ok , it might be a short seven-minute long fan-film film rather than a professional production with all of the bells and whistles of a Netflix original , but ‘ Witcher : First Hunt ’ is an enjoyable take on the world of the Witcher . Since it ’ s only seven minutes long , we won ’ t spoil too much of what happens , but suffice to say it follows Geralt through a scenario that anyone who ’ s played the Witcher games will be familiar with . If you ’ d like to check out Witcher : First Hunt for yourself then the full thing is available now on Amazon Prime .

Google had a host of new features to announce for its smart home speaker , Google Home , at this year ’ s Google IO . From offering proactive notifications , to free phone calls ( in the US and Canada ) , expanding its music support and offering visual responses to queries , Google is working hard to expand its smart speaker ’ s functionality . But what was surprising about many of the announcements is how closely they mirror similar ones made by Amazon with its Amazon Echo in the past couple of weeks . Google has been closely watching what Amazon ’ s up to , and it ’ s determined not to let the online retailer get ahead . Proactive notifications ? Announced by Amazon in a developer post earlier today . Phone calls ? Announced by Amazon just over a week ago . Visual responses to queries ? Sounds a lot like the Amazon Echo Show to me . I ’ m not trying to claim that Google is playing catch-up to Amazon in every respect . After all , Google has managed to integrate voice recognition into Google Home while Amazon is still fumbling with its multi-user support . But these developments show just how closely Google is keeping an eye on the competition and , frankly , it ’ s an amazing thing for the emerging smart speaker market . This level of competition between the two major players means that both products are developing at an astounding pace . Barely a week goes by without a new feature being announced for either smart speaker , and for the most part they ’ re coming as free software updates rather than entirely new pieces of hardware ( Amazon Echo Show and Look notwithstanding ) . This is only partially about winning over potential customers , it ’ s also about winning over manufacturers , who are rushing to integrate voice control into their appliances and audio visual equipment . Both Amazon and Google know that they need to fight hard to make sure their virtual assistant platforms are the obvious choice for other hardware manufacturers . We ’ ve seen dozens of pieces of hardware already this year with either one assistant or the other , and this is only going to become more common in the future . What ’ s clear is that it ’ s impractical for hardware manufacturers to support both assistants in the future , and both of them want to be dominant . These assistants are nowhere near finished , but if development continues at this pace , then the future might be a lot closer than we think . It ’ s a good thing for the industry , and it ’ s a great thing for consumers .
If nothing else , Amazon should be commended for how it has continued to improve its Amazon Echo month after month with a steady stream of useful updates . Now a new post on Amazon 's developer site says Echo devices will soon have the ability to visually show you when they have notifications available . They 'll do this with a pulsing green light and a chime , which you can then respond to in order to hear all your notifications one after the other . Such functionality is long overdue for the Echo . The speaker could , for example , light up in the morning if there 's travel disruption on your route , rather than relying on you asking how the traffic is every single morning . Or the speaker could warn you if it 's going to rain , to save you having to constantly ask about the weather . However , we 've got some reservations about how notifications will work on a device that 's supposed to serve multiple users in a household . How will Amazon prevent your housemates from being pestered by your news alerts , for example ? Amazon 's multi-user support is still in its infancy , but these are issues that Amazon will need to overcome if its Echos are to become an integral part of the home , rather than a toy for just one member of the household .

Amazon is upgrading its cheapest range of tablets with Amazon Alexa for those in the UK and a few other minor improvements for everyone , but the great price is here to stay . The new Amazon Fire still costs $ 49.99 ( £49.99 ) but is now thinner , lighter , comes with dual-band Wi-Fi and slightly improved battery life . There ’ s still a 7-inch IPS display on the front , but it is now slightly clearer than in previous iterations and the slate will also pack a MediaTek 1.3GHz chipset . Amazon claims the battery life will be improved too , with an extra hour of life , giving you around eight hours of mixed usage . Storage-wise , the cheapest version is still on 8GB , but there ’ s microSD support and a slightly more expensive 16GB option . You can also pick this up in new shades of blue , black , red and yellow . Amazon is also upgrading the slightly more expensive but better Fire HD 8 range and including dual-Wi-Fi support as well . You ’ ll be able to get 16GB or 32GB versions of this tablet for either $ 79.99 ( £79.99 ) or £99.99 ( about $ 130 ) respectively . Amazon ’ s voice assistant Alexa being integrated with the Amazon Fire range is perhaps the most exciting element for those in the UK - the US got the feature last year - and it allows you to do almost anything you can on the Echo or Echo Dot , but on your tablet instead . Unlike those devices it will offer up a visual sign of what you ’ re doing as well though . For example , if you ask it for sport scores it will give you more information , including the date and time of the game . The new versions of the Amazon Fire and Fire HD 8 will be available from June 7 in both the US and the UK . There 's no word on the tablets coming to Australia at the moment .

Not content with simply announce a new addition to its Echo line of smart speakers , Amazon continues to upgrade Alexa in the hopes it becomes your go-to digital assistant . Amazon will soon add yet another ability to Alexa 's repertoire in the form of notifications — giving users spoken updates from Alexa on what 's new across a selection of the digital assistant 's 12,000-plus skills . Like most of Alexa 's talents , catching up on notifications is as easy as a voice prompt such as , `` Alexa , what did I miss ? '' or `` Alexa , what are my notifications ? '' to their Echo or other Alexa-compatible devices . According to Amazon , companies like AccuWeather , The Washington Post , Just Eat , and Life360 will be among the first to update their skills with notification functionality as the feature begins rolling out to developers . Introducing Notifications for Alexa , a way to proactively signal new content is available from skills and domains : https : //t.co/eif7pXiuuX pic.twitter.com/LBtyNBxg87May 16 , 2017 While Amazon does n't have a hard date for when notifications will make their way to the Alexa-using public , the feature will be opt-in per applicable skill and can be temporarily muted or deactivated completely at a user 's choosing . It 's been a busy growth period for Alexa , as Amazon also announced new skills like Google Account support , improved voice recognition , and taking calls within the past month . As for competition , we believe Google has n't been sitting idly by with its competing Google Home smart speaker , as it 's rumored to be adding some features of its own soon . Seeing as the Google IO 2017 conference kicks off tomorrow , we wo n't have to wait long before learning what the team behind the Google Assistant-powered smart speaker has to offer against Amazon 's Alexa .

If you own an Amazon Echo or Amazon Echo Dot , at some point your device has overheard something you ’ ve said , mistaken it for the word “ Alexa ” and given you a wacky response to a question you never asked . It ’ s a weird , but somewhat ubiquitous experience for most Echo owners . If this only happen to you once in a blue moon , however , consider yourself lucky . For anyone who owns a third-party Echo device – like say this is much more frequent occurrence ... or at least it was . Starting today , Amazon is making the same Cloud-Based Wake Word Verification algorithm the Echo and Echo Dot use available to third-party hardware makers that will make it so these devices will only respond to the word “ Alexa ” . Here ’ s how it works : Alexa will start listening any time it thinks it hears its name , but it won ’ t formally process and respond to the request until the device checks in with cloud voice recognition software that it actually heard “ Alexa ” and not something that sounds like it . According to Amazon , the process is almost instantaneous and it shouldn ’ t slow down or delay Alexa ’ s response time in any way . In more or less words , devices like the Triby Bluetooth speaker ( a device that comes with Amazon ’ s Alexa built-in ) will no longer mistake words for “ Alexa ” . That will mean less frustration for everyone and fewer times you get a weird , unsettling response from Alexa for a question you didn ’ t ask . If this story sounds like it has the perfect makings for a comedy segment , you ’ re right . Too bad Saturday Night Live beat us all to the punch : Via The Verge

Well , the Amazon Echo had a good run as an ad-free platform – and all good things , as they say , must come to an end . The harbinger of the advertising apocalypse is a company called VoiceLabs and its plan is to tack on 6 to 15-second advertisements at the beginning and end of some Alexa skills . The platform helps advertisers setup “ Sponsored Messages ” and , according to VoiceLabs , users have generally not minded the interruption . It ’ s VoiceLabs ’ goal to make the advertisements brief and unobtrusive for most users , but also `` lead a consumer into an experience or converse with the consumer as they exit . '' Yep , conversational advertisements are now a thing apparently . So far , however , only two noteworthy companies have signed on to participate in VoiceLabs ’ tests : Wendy ’ s ( an American fast-food chain ) and ESPN . So which apps can you expect to hear these ads on ? So far Federated Media , XAPPmedia , TWiT.tv , Appbly and a few other developers have signed on board . Well , say you ’ re using one of the 327 sports skills on Amazon Echo or the Amazon Echo Dot . At the beginning of the skill , you might hear an ad that says “ Welcome , thanks for listening and thanks to ESPN for sponsoring us . ” So far , not so bad , right ? Use the app a few more times and ESPN might inform you of a big sports event coming up before asking if you ’ d like to be reminded to watch it . ( Though , from the sounds of it you ’ re welcome to politely turn down the invitation to tune in . ) Here ’ s the good news : there are some very strict limitations on which apps can use Sponsored Messages – they can only appear in streaming music , radio or flash briefing skills and they ca n't use Alexa 's voice to say them . What that means is the vast majority of the Echo 's 13,000 available skills won ’ t be a target for new ads … well , for now , at least . While you wait for that to happen , there 's always the Echo 's rival , Google Home , to consider . Source : VoiceLabs

For all there is to like about Apple TV , the set-top box does have one major flaw : no support for Amazon 's widely popular Prime Video service . However , it looks like the two companies may set aside differences and address the missing feature this summer . Apple will reportedly announce support for Amazon 's premium streaming service on the Apple TV during its WWDC keynote on June 5 , sources familiar with the matter tell BuzzFeed News . This report backs up a previous rumor that Amazon Prime Video would make its way to Apple TV this summer , though BuzzFeed says the official launch date is still subject to change . Should this new arrival come to be , it would not only address a glaring omission on Apple 's set-top box , but possibly suggest a friendlier coexistence between the iPhone maker and Amazon going forward . In addition to Amazon Prime Video coming to Apple TV , today 's report also claims Amazon will return the favor and resume selling Apple TVs on its website . If true , this change comes two years after Amazon pulled the Apple TV ( as well as Google Chromecasts ) from its digital shelves in favor of platforms without a competing video service , such as Rokus , game consoles and , of course , its own Amazon Fire TV . That was n't the first time Amazon and Apple did n't play well together , either . In 2014 , Amazon stripped in-app payments from the iOS versions of several of its services — including the recently acquired ComiXology — in response to Apple demanding a 30 % cut of each sale . Even the though the ice will apparently thaw between Apple and Amazon soon , Google and Amazon may be at odds for a little bit longer as Chromecasts still have limited to zero support for Amazon Prime Video . All hope is not lost , however , as the Nvidia Shield — powered by Android TV — got the app this year thanks to a recent Android 7.0 Nougat update .

A new Samsung patent appears to indicate that the company is working on a Bixby-equipped smart speaker in the vein of the Amazon Echo . The filing , which was reported by Patently Apple , shows a screen mounted above a slimline tripod suggesting the device is equipped with a display much like the recently announced Amazon Echo Show and Apple ’ s rumored Siri speaker . The move would certainly make sense . All the major voice assistant players have either announced , or are rumored , to be working on making a fixed speaker to house their smart AI . Amazon ’ s Alexa has the Amazon Echo , Microsoft ’ s Cortana has Harmon Karden ’ s upcoming speaker , and rumors are increasingly circulating about Apple building a Siri speaker . Samsung is already building out the ecosystem that a smart speaker needs , and its SmartThings ecosystem would allow such a speaker to act as a control point for your smart home . But Bixby as a voice assistant still lags behind the competition , and currently doesn ’ t even support voice commands outside of Samsung 's native Korean . Samsung still has a lot of work to do on its voice assistant if it hopes to one-day make it the center of your smart home , but with the amount of interest voice assistants are currently getting it will be easy for the company to justify the continued investment .

Looking to save a few bucks when you pick up a new game , some books , or the newly unveiled Amazon Echo Show ? You might be in luck . Amazon appears to have dropped its free shipping minimum to $ 25 — just months after it had already lowered it to $ 35 from $ 49 , making this the first time Amazon 's cap has been at the $ 25 mark since 2013 , according to Best Black Friday . Originally , orders containing only books valued at $ 25 and up could be mailed for free , but now it appears that any qualifying orders of that amount or more can be shipped anywhere in the US without paying shipping and handling costs . Though Amazon did n't say why it lowered its rates , speculation is that competition from fellow big-box retailer Walmart spurred the decrease . It 's widely believed that Walmart 's recent two-day shipping policy announced earlier this year prompted Amazon 's first shipping minimum dip , while Wally World 's new Store Pickup service — which allows customers to pick up their online orders in-store for a discount — may have pushed Amazon to dig even deeper . It could also be getting prepared even earlier this year to lure customers in for Black Friday . It 's worth noting that Amazon 's site states orders shipped for free will take approximately 5-8 business days to arrive . Comparatively , those who shell out $ 99/year for Amazon Prime are eligible for unlimited free two-day shipping on all qualifying purchases , as well as a laundry list of other perks .
Amazon 's Alexa may have over 10,000 skills , but that does n't mean the digital assistant found in the Amazon Echo , Echo Dot , and other devices is done learning new tricks . Soon , Alexa will also be able to take calls and send out messages for you , whisking off your digital communiqué to other Alexa users with simple voice commands . Using this new skill is as straightforward as saying `` Alexa , call Mom , '' or `` Alexa , play back my messages , '' and is offered at no additional charge . Additionally , calling friends and family via Alexa is still an option for those without one of Amazon 's smart speakers . According to Amazon , the digital assistant is able to reach just about any Alexa-enabled device , meaning that iOS and Android phones can also take advantage of the feature by downloading the Alexa app . The feature does n't have a specific date for release just yet , but is expected to come out sooner rather than later . We expect it wo n't be too far behind , as Amazon 's other recent reveal — the Amazon Echo Show — takes Alexa 's newest feature to the next level with integrated video calling .
Update : After numerous leaks , the Amazon Echo Show has finally been announced . Original story continues below ... The Amazon Echo Show could be with us very soon , if the latest leaks are to be believed . After images of a new Amazon device leaked online last week , it looks like the retail giant 's screen-equipped Echo assistant might be set for a reveal later today , when pre-orders are tipped to open . And it looks like we now know the name of the new device , with a screenshot sent to AFTVnews revealing the Amazon Echo Show moniker . The leak also reveals an Echo Show price of $ 229.99 ( around £219.99 , AU $ 310 ) , which is much more expensive than the $ 180 ( £149.99 , around AU $ 245 ) Amazon Echo . This makes a certain amount of sense , as the new device should contain all of the functionality of the previous Echo devices , while adding a screen for good measure . As well as a screen , the new device is rumored to include a webcam , which perhaps points towards it having similar functionality as the recently annouced Amazon Echo Look , in addition to some form of video-calling functionality . Pre-orders will apparently start on the May 9 , presumably in just a few hours time . Although the device originally had a later release date , a source recently told Cnet that its release was pushed forward , due to the rapid development of competitor Google Home . We have contacted Amazon for comment and will update this piece when they respond .
Amazon is offering its Prime customers an intimate alternative to the world ’ s biggest music festivals with its new Prime Live Events . Launching this month , Prime Live Events will give Prime customers the exclusive opportunity to see some of the world ’ s biggest music artists performing up close and personal in a variety of small but iconic venues around London . The first Prime Live event is scheduled to take place on May 23 and will see Blondie taking to the stage in the historic Round Chapel in Hackney to perform a mix of their greatest hits and new material from the album Pollinator to just 750 fans . Following on from Blondie , Alison Moyet will also take to the Round Chapel stage to perform her own concert on June 12 with a pre-gig Q & A with the audience also planned . Tickets for both of these gigs are set to go on sale exclusively to Prime members on Thursday May 11 at 9am BST and you can buy yours right here . As the tickets for these events are exclusive to Prime members , there ’ ll be no preferential Prime discount or prize giveaways like iTunes customers get for the Apple Music Festival . Prices for the concerts that have been announced range from £75 to £150 , which , considering their size and exclusivity is n't unsurprising . More Prime Live Events are already planned with Texas set to play to 600 fans on June at Porchester Hall , and Katie Melua playing two dates on July 25 and 26 at Cadogan Hall in Chelsea to 770 Amazon Prime member fans each night . Amazon has said more artists will be announced throughout the year but eager customers will be able to sign up via email or follow Prime Live Events on Twitter and Facebook to receive updates on performances and ticket sales . Prime customers unable to attend the live performances won ’ t miss out either , with Amazon promising that all of the performances will be filmed and made exclusively available on Prime Video internationally with no additional membership costs . Outside of Amazon ’ s own Prime Live Events , Prime customers in the UK now have access to Amazon Tickets pre-sales for music , theatre and touring shows across the UK . These pre-sales will allow Prime customers to purchase tickets at least 24 hours before general public sales start and will also include access to premium seating options in Amazon lounges in The O2 and SSE arena in London .

Update : After numerous leaks , the Amazon Echo Show has finally been announced . Original story continues below ... The rumors about the new Amazon Echo , the one with a touchscreen and a camera , have reached a fever pitch . It ’ s a very good thing , then , that Amazon might be ready to lift the curtain on the product as soon as tomorrow morning . Amazon ’ s proposed plans to announce the device come by way of The Wall Street Journal who say that it could launch at $ 200 ( about £150 , AU $ 270 ) and can corroborate earlier reports that the device will be capable of video calling . Amazon ’ s new touchscreen device would come hot on the heels of the Echo Look , another Echo product that specializes in fashion analysis that Amazon announced last week and , potentially , share some of the same functionality . Two new Amazon devices in two weeks ? It ’ s certainly a possibility . Despite weeks of rumors , we don ’ t know all that much about Amazon ’ s follow-up to the original Echo . So , what do we know ? We know that it ’ s very likely to include a camera and a touch screen – two components that would radically change the way the Echo works . From the sounds of the WSJ ’ s report , though , it doesn ’ t seem like video calling would be available as soon as the new Echo comes out – instead , features would be rolled out 'in stages ' . This would start with the ability to use two Echo devices in your home into an intercom system before eventually becoming a full-on Skype replacement , for example . While the report didn ’ t have a name for the product , we know from previous reports that Amazon has codenamed the product 'the Echo Knight ' . Does that codename have a hidden meaning ? We ’ ll just have to wait until tomorrow to find out .
Update : After numerous leaks , the Amazon Echo Show has finally been announced , so read on for our opinion on why the Echo lineup could benefit from a screen-equipped device . Original story continues below ... Part of what made the original Amazon Echo such a surprising and original product was how it completely removed the touch-screen , which has become our default way of interacting with digital devices . But recent leaks point towards the next generation of Amazon Echo speakers coming equipped with a touch screen of their own , a dramatic change of direction for Amazon ’ s home-based voice assistants . Amazon isn ’ t the only company reportedly considering combining a screen with a non-portable voice assistant since Apple ’ s rumored Siri Speaker will also reportedly feature a screen . @ AFTVnews Here , let me help you with that . pic.twitter.com/9YokBj4pXQMay 5 , 2017 But would n't the move negate entirely what Amazon has attempted to accomplish with Alexa ? Releasing a piece of consumer electronics without a screen was a bold move , and it came with some significant challenges , but until now we ’ d expected Amazon to persevere with improving its audio-based interface . Since the very first computers we ’ ve relied upon screens to provide the majority of their output , so it ’ s going to require some significant work to provide the same functionality through voice . In spite of the challenge , I was always hoping that Amazon would struggle through and do the hard work required to make it work . Releasing a device with a screen seems to imply that the company has , at least partially , thrown in the towel . Except Amazon has already conceded that certain actions will require a screen . Attempt to manage a to-do list using your Echo , for example , and you still currently need to use the Alexa companion app on your smartphone to tick off tasks as ‘ done ’ . Want to change the default music player ? You ’ ll need to dig into Alexa ’ s settings , on your smartphone . It can be hard to think about the end-goal of an initiative like the Amazon Echo because nothing like it has ever existed . But it might be helpful to think of it as being having the equivalent of personal butler sitting in your living room , waiting to help you out with your day . Ask a butler what letters you ’ ve received and you ’ d never expect them to read out each of your letters for you , you ’ d hope that they ’ d show you the most important ones directly . In a similar way , it would get frustrating quickly to have an Echo read out your entire inbox , but an Echo with a screen could pick the most important emails to show to you . Similarly if you were asking a butler for traffic advice , rather than them trying to describe exactly where the congestion is , it would be much for convenient for them to show you a map , and point to the difficult roads so you can avoid them . An Echo with a screen would be much better in this regard . Although entirely voice-based assistants seem like a cool future , the truth is that there ’ s certain information that will always be easier to display visually , and having to rely on pulling a smartphone out of your pocket simply isn ’ t as convenient as simply showing you directly on the device . Although Amazon has yet to officially confirm the existence of the product , the quality of the leaks , combined with the existence of the recently announced Amazon Echo Look , makes this a convincing direction for Amazon to take . And , frankly , I ’ m ok with it . I love my Echo , but only part of that is because it ’ s a smart device I can control with my voice . Mostly I just like having a mini computer set up in my kitchen to deal with occasional queries that it ’ s not worth fetching my phone to do . So ultimately an Echo with a screen isn ’ t quite the change of direction that it had originally seemed . If handled well it could be just a better way of presenting you with the information you need without overwhelming you with minutes of lengthy audio explanation . All that we need now is for Amazon to actually officially confirm the existence of the device , but given how finished the leaked shots look , I can ’ t imagine it ’ s far off .

Update 2 : After numerous leaks , the Amazon Echo Show has finally been announced . Update : Ignore the image at the bottom of the page , pro product-sleuth Evan Blass found a high-res image that he shared via Twitter . Same device , much clearer look . Oh , and this updated Echo apparently comes in a white color option , too . @ AFTVnews Here , let me help you with that . pic.twitter.com/9YokBj4pXQMay 5 , 2017 Original story continues below ... Amazon is far from finished with its line of artificial intelligence-equipped smart devices . Earlier this week we learned about the Echo Look , and now we ’ ve seen our first image of the Amazon Echo with touchscreen , known internally as the Echo ‘ Knight ’ . The new smart device is rumored to have an improved forward-facing speaker ( goodbye 360-degree sound ) and a camera that will enable video calling , in addition to the touchscreen . How exactly the new Echo device would achieve calling – whether it would tether to your phone or require its own SIM card – is still to be determined . Regardless , the device will present numerous challenges to Amazon . All of the voice commands that we ’ ve grown accustom to over the last few years using the device will now require visuals to go alongside them . It will no longer be enough for Alexa to tell us the weather , but we ’ ll need an accompanying visual to go alongside it now , too . The leak comes by way of AFTVnews , who says a potential sticker price is likely to be more than $ 200 ( the current price of the Amazon Echo ) but below $ 300 – in between £150 and £250 , or AU $ 270 and AU $ 400 . The news outlet also says to expect the official unveiling of the product sometime in the near future – likely within the next month or so . So how , exactly , did AFTVnews find out about the new Echo device ? Apparently AFTVnews did some digging on Amazon ’ s servers and located a low-res image for the device . While we wouldn ’ t always bite on these kinds of leaks , this is the same site that discovered the Amazon Echo Look one month before its announcement , so there ’ s some credibility built up here . Does that mean it ’ s time to toss out the old Echo devices to make room for a camera-ready iteration ? Well , we might not go that far just yet .
With every self-respecting streaming device offering a comprehensive set of video services that includes the Amazon Video player , the Apple TV set top box has looked quite lacking by virtue of the app 's omission . That may be about to change however – ReCode reports that Apple is now readying the Amazon Video app for launch on its platform this summer . If true , it 'll be the thawing of a tumultuously icy relationship between the two companies . The rival companies have been at loggerheads as to how Amazon 's videos get distributed on Apple 's devices for some time . Currently , Amazon Video users must use Apple 's AirPlay function to play back videos on the big screen , rather than have access to a native app player . In addition , Apple refuses to let Amazon sell its services through an iOS app without taking a share for itself , meaning users must establish accounts in a browser before using Amazon 's services – rather than having the means to enter payment details in the app itself . As either a defense measure , a means of pushing its own Amazon Fire players or simple retribution , Amazon stopped selling Apple TV devices . But with a 4K Apple TV box said to be in the works , the Cupertino company will need both Amazon 's retail clout and easy access to its 4K content to make it a success . We 'll keep you posted if and when the news goes official .
YouTube has announced that it ’ s producing 40 new shows for online streaming , pitting itself against already established streaming giants Amazon Prime , Netflix and Hulu . There ’ s an impressive roster of talent too , with Kevin Hart helming a fitness show , Ellen DeGeneres helming a behind-the-scenes celebrity show , and Ludacris presenting a talent show produced by Ryan Seacrest Productions . Building on the strength of its current content creators , YouTube is creating a long-form version of its most popular daily show Good Mythical Morning from Rhett & Link , and giving The Slow Mo Guys their own show to explore the world of technology . The thing that could prove to be the competition-killer is that all of these shows will be completely free to watch ; YouTube will drive revenue entirely from advertisements . Adverts are already a common occurrence on YouTube , so this shouldn ’ t be too painful , but obviously we ’ ll have to wait and see how many adverts there are . Advertisers target successful YouTube videos using Google Preferred , Google ’ s algorithms to give each channel a ‘ Preference score ’ based on the popularity of the channel and how passionate people are about it . This helps YouTube to classify which channels are “ like prime-time television ” as Google puts it in its explanation video . If you would rather not have the adverts , you can sign up to YouTube Red where all videos are ad-free . The monthly subscription service also allows you to download videos , which could prove invaluable if you want to watch one of the new shows on your daily commute . Via CNET

Outside of Amazon ’ s original productions , some of the best shows to appear on Amazon Prime Video have been those made available via its deal with HBO . HBO is the premium cable TV broadcaster behind such classics as The Wire , Sex and the City , and The Sopranos , but these show and others will shortly be disappearing from the service ( via : TrustedReviews ) Read more : TCL 5-Series ( S517 , S515 ) The move is due to HBO ’ s own HBO Now service , which allows viewers to subscribe to watch HBO ’ s content via a standalone $ 14.99 subscription . Previously HBO has encouraged users to subscribe to its own service by keeping its current flagship programs , including Game of Thrones and Westworld , as exclusives , while licensing out its back catalogue to other providers . Speaking on a quarterly earnings call , HBO CEO Richard Plepler said : “ I don ’ t think you ’ ll see us extend or expand our library programming on Amazon beyond the end of next year . ” HBO ’ s isn ’ t the only content to be disappearing from streaming platforms . Recently , Netflix announced that a host of Fox programs , including Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Arrested Development and Firefly , would be leaving the service . It feels as though platforms such as Amazon Prime and Netflix , which once acted as aggregators of other provider ’ s content , are fast turning into content producers in their own right . Consequently they ’ re being seen as competitors by the likes of HBO , who appear to no longer be willing to beef up those services ' catalogues .

To celebrate the Oscar-winning film Manchester by the Sea being released on Amazon Prime , Amazon is gifting every home in the real Manchester-by-the-Sea area a free year-long subscription to the streaming service and three packs of popcorn to enjoy with the film . Each house in the area will be receiving a box containing a gift card and the three packs of Amazon 's Wickedly Prime popcorn this week – so you do n't have enough time to move to the area in order to get in on the deal unfortunately . It was a good year for the producing arm of Amazon Prime , Amazon Studios , at the Academy Awards , with seven nominations and three wins . This marks the first time that a streaming service has won Best Actor , Best Screenplay and Best Foreign Film . The Actor and Screenplay wins were both for Manchester by the Sea , with Casey Affleck taking home Best Actor and Kenneth Lonergan taking home Best Original Screenplay . The Best Foreign Film Oscar was taken home by Asghar Farhadi , writer and director of The Salesman . These films , and the winner of Best Film , Moonlight , will all be added to the Amazon Prime roster during May .

Amazon 's in-house smartphones could 've been better , but that 's not stopping the online retail giant from selling discounted handsets as a way to promote its premium Prime service . Amazon Prime members can now save big on five new Android phones , including the Moto E4 and the newly announced Nokia 6 , courtesy of Prime Exclusive Phones . In addition to the savings , Amazon 's phone lineup comes unlocked , granting buyers the option to go with whatever applicable carrier suits their needs . However , what you save on cash is made up with built-in ads and pre-loaded Amazon apps , similar to what Amazon offers with the proprietary Fire tablet . While some may not want their handset riddled with personalized offers , others may be willing to bear it to save between $ 50- $ 70 — especially if they 're already entrenched in Amazon Prime 's premium membership . The most notable of the handsets coming to Prime Exclusive Phones is the Nokia 6 , which was just announced for the US earlier this week . It 's on sale for $ 179.99 with Prime — $ 50 off its normal asking price . The Nokia 6 runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 octo-core processor , 3GB RAM , and 32GB of internal storage . Next is the Moto E4 , a decent budget Android phone from Motorola that costs just $ 99.99 with Prime , down from $ 129.99 . This handset features a Snapdragon 425 quad-core processor , 16GB of internal storage , and a 5-inch HD display . Finally , three models of Alcatel phones were added to the Prime lineup , including the Idol 5S for $ 199.99 ( reduced from $ 279.99 ) , the A30 Plus for $ 79.99 and the A50 for $ 99.99 ( reduced from $ 129.99 and $ 149.99 , respectively . ) As you can probably guess from the price , the Alcatel Idol 5S is the most powerful of the bunch , sporting a Snapdragon 625 processor and 32GB of storage . The A30 Plus and A50 feature 2GB RAM and 16GB of storage , but lack higher-end doodads like a fingerprint sensor . At the time of writing , all five phones are advertised as compatible with AT & T and T-Mobile , with the Moto E4 also supporting Verizon and Sprint 's networks . Support for additional carriers is expected for certain phones , according to Business Insider , and all five handsets come loaded with Android Nougat .

Finding the Amazon Echo on sale is n't a rare experience , but getting it 28 % off the normal list price is n't the type of discount that happens everyday . Amazon has reduced the price by $ 50 in a 24-hour flash sale , so you 're going to ultimately pay $ 129.99 for the Alexa-enabled smart speaker . That 's the lowest price we 've seen for the Amazon Echo , which normally retails for $ 179.99 . Now it 's priced to compete with the $ 129.99 Google Home . Both the Amazon Echo in black and the one in white are seeing the price drop , but the amount goes back up to the full $ 179.99 at midnight . The Amazon Echo Show release date is Wednesday , June 28 , and it 's already on sale if you care to buy two smart speakers with a screen embedded into them . You can save $ 100 on the Amazon Echo Show when you buy two and use the promo code SHOW2PACK at checkout . Each costs $ 229.99 This is a deal for early adopters who consider the Alexa AI their best friend , as you 'll be spending $ 599.98 . But that beats spending nearly $ 700 on a pair . With Google Home software updated recently and Apple HomePod launching at the end of the year , Amazon is making a big new push with its smart speaker . We 'll have an Amazon Echo Show review soon and let you know how it performs as a screen-enabled smart speaker .
Amazon 's Echo Show is a curious device – taking the unique selling point of the voice-only Alexa powered Echo speaker family , and pairing it up with a touchscreen interface . As many are left wondering what separates the Echo Show from a tablet with a kickstand ( considering all iPads have the Siri voice assistant , Android tablets make use of the Google Assistant and Amazon 's own Fire slates already have Alexa built in , Amazon has today revealed a series of videos showing off how the Show will complement voice control with visual feedback . The first video ( embedded below ) describes how music playback will work on the Echo Show : For a search for the artists Sia , for instance , you 'd be presented with a screen displaying album artwork , each numbered . Stating `` Alexa , play number 3 '' would start that album playing . A video on Alexa 's movie info search works in a similar fashion ( with posters and trailers supplanting album artwork ) , while a shopping list function offered the option to scroll through lengthy lists by voice command alone . The videos essentially highlight the hands-off nature of the Echo Show – few touchscreen buttons are present , all navigation can be handled by voice , and text is displayed in a large enough font to be read at a distance . For Amazon 's Alexa system to advance , its machine learning feedback will require continued , varied voice input from millions of users . The Echo Show may have a screen , but it 's clear that Amazon still wants to hear your voice as it looks to improve its virtual assistant 's recognition capabilities longterm . There are a further three videos if you 're interested – click through for a look at how the Show handles requests for what 's playing at cinemas , here for browsing shopping lists and here for setting alarms and do not disturb parameters .
Update : Amazon Echo is still on sale , and so is the Amazon Echo Show , even before it officially launches on Wednesday . Read the updated story for the latest news . There 's a temporary Amazon Echo price drop going on right now , and today is n't even the online retailer 's famous Amazon Prime Day . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 It 's on sale for $ 50 off today only through Amazon , making the popular Alexa-enabled smart speaker just $ 129.99 in the US . It does n't appear to be on sale anywhere outside of America , however . This is the cheapest Amazon Echo has been all year , and it 's already Amazon 's No . 1 best-selling home automation product . It could break records today . There 's been a tremendous surge of interest in smart speakers , but Amazon had a head start vs the Google Home and the forthcoming Apple HomePod . This is a 24-hour Amazon Echo sale , according to Amazon . After that , its flagship Alexa speaker will revert to the normal price of $ 179.99 . We do n't officially know when Amazon Prime Day will be , but it 's not today . Yes , this is the biggest Amazon Echo discount this year , tying Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals last year , but the Deal of the Day is limited to this deal . The fact that a full-on Amazon Prime Day is n't happening right now lines up with our thinking : Amazon Prime Day is closer to mid-July , like last year 's July 12 date . We 'll let you know when more Amazon mega-sales happen , and we 'll keep asking Alexa to fill us in on the details . Alex is our best source these days . For now , enjoy the Amazon Echo price drop ; it does n't happen too often for the smart speaker . Of course , that may change with the rival Apple HomePod launch .

Amazon Echo 's newest trick — calling and text via the Alexa digital assistant — may have already gotten a sorely needed improvement , but the smart speaker is about to get yet another new feature that makes keeping up with your messages a little more intuitive . Expected to roll out soon , Amazon will update its Echo speakers to shine a yellow light when users have a new voice or text message waiting for them . Besides expanding the color scheme on Amazon 's normally monochrome tube , the yellow signal also helps distinguish unchecked messages from incoming calls . Originally , a pulsing green light was used for both saved messages and someone calling on the line , causing confusion for some users . From now on though , a green light will be reserved just for incoming calls . 🚨New light alert 🚨Coming soon to an Echo near you , yellow light = new message ( voice or text ) awaits . Green light = incoming call . 💛📩💚📞 pic.twitter.com/jNp96NxqtMJune 19 , 2017 Amazon began rolling out calling and text features to its Alexa digital assistant last month , allowing owners with Echos or other devices with the Alexa app to leave messages or ring up other Alexa users with a simple voice command . Alexa-to-Alexa calling is currently only available in the US , with Amazon urging curious international users to stay tuned for further updates .

Amazon has dabbled in home food delivery with Amazon Fresh , but now the company is making a big step healthy food market by acquiring Whole Foods for $ 13.7 billion . Not only is this one of the biggest acquisitions in history – making Disney buying Marvel and Lucasfilm for $ 4 billion each seem like small deals by comparison– it has the potential to vastly expand the reach of Amazon Fresh . Wholefoods has brick and mortar stores around the world in the Untied States , Canada and the United Kingdom . Amazon has steadily been increasing its focus on delivering every type of good to its customers including groceries . More recently , the e-tailer announced its designs to build its first physical grocery store based in Seattle , Washington , which is to be named Amazon Go and expected to open in early 2017 . If the acquisition goes through , Amazon plans to continue to operate all the Whole Foods stores under its original name as a separate unit of the company . The deal between Amazon and Whole Foods should close in the second half of the year .

Alexa may be famous for powering Amazon Echo smart speakers , but the digital assistant is no stranger to other devices . In fact , the next doodad to get the Alexa treatment is the Amazon Dash Wand , which is making a comeback since its 2014 debut alongside a special promotion for Amazon Prime subscribers that essentially makes it a no-brainer . Using an attached bar code scanner , the wireless Wand instantly adds items to your Amazon shopping cart , making restocking the pantry as simple as zapping a used package before throwing it out . The Dash Wand can also support Alexa voice commands for additional useful functions like home automation , looking up recipes , measurement conversions , and ordering last minute items . What Alexa ca n't do on the Dash Wand , it seems , is play your music , video , or apps — something to consider . The Amazon Dash Wand is available in the US for an even $ 20 for Amazon Prime members , who can save even more thanks to an ongoing $ 20 credit promotion and free 90-day trial of its AmazonFresh grocery delivery service simply for registering a new device . Considering the promotion makes the Amazon Dash Wand practically gratis , now may be the time to try out grocery shopping online , especially if you 'd rather not drop the $ 179 ( £150 , around AU $ 230 ) on an Amazon Echo for a little help around the kitchen .
Voice control is in our phones , it ’ s in our smart speakers , it ’ s even in our games consoles . Could the next area to be touched by the voice recognition revolution be toys ? That ’ s what robotic toy manufacturer Sphero seems to think . Leaving the gears and motors of its BB-8 and Cars 3 bots to one side , it ’ s going all-in on voice for its new Spider-Man toy . Once again tapping up Disney for a key licensed property ( Marvel exists these days as a subsidiary of the Mouse House ) , Sphero ’ s Spider-Man toy is a stylized take on the comic book hero , looking not unlike the popular Funko Pop models with his oversized head and squat body . Standing roughly a foot tall , he ’ s static aside from moveable arms and expressive eyes , which use LCD screens to shift and change to show Spidey ’ s changing mood . It ’ s the circuitry and smart tech under the plastic though that sets the Sphero Spider-Man apart from other toy takes on the wallcrawler . Built on a custom fork of Android , Sphero ’ s Spider-Man is capable of holding a basic conversation with its owner , with a spot-on voice actor delivering a lengthy , branching and interactive script from a Marvel comics scribe . You ’ ll pick from a selection of superhero names with which Spidey will identify you , and play a number of voice-enhanced games with the character . IR sensors and motion detectors let the toy react convincingly to how he ’ s being played with , being ( for instance ) intelligently aware of when we weren ’ t being quite enthusiastic enough with our superhero jumps during a crimefighting session . The real Spidey would surely have a quip regarding security in a toy that ’ s listening to what your kids say , but Sphero has taken efforts to ensure privacy is paramount . For starters , the Sphero Spider-Man won ’ t start listening until you push in the spider-crest button on his chest ( one push for a quick game , a double press to kick off one of the 25 longer ‘ Super Villain Missions ’ , which are a bit like voice-controlled Choose Your Own Adventure quests ) . And though Spider-Man can receive content updates through a connected iPhone or Android app , it ’ s closed off from the rest of the experience – there ’ s no cloud processing being done in order for Spidey to deliver his one liners . It ’ s the content updates that will certainly make the toy one to watch . Sphero will be able to update Spider-Man to take into account the events of new Marvel storylines , and constantly expand on his repertoire of voice commands . The toy line as a whole seems ripe for expansion – imagine an Iron Man Sphero that could have a chat with this Spider-Man ? Indeed , the packaging for Spidey shows the villain Venom sporting a similar look to the pint-sized webslinger , so it may well yet be in the works . Sphero ’ s Spider-Man has plenty of in-jokes to please parents – for example , overly shaking him will see Spidey pretend to go into a progress-wiping factory reset mode which is sure to send kids into a meltdown and have adults in stitches . But as a toy design he ’ s clearly aimed at young pre-teen kids . Chunky and with a rubberised grip feel to his suit , the Sphero Spider-Man has a good amount of weight to it , and looks as though it could take a beating without doing too much damage . Even the simple charging base which Spider-Man stands on to refuel seems designed with children and simplicity in mind . There are kinks to be ironed out before Spider-Man goes on sale at £149.99 / $ 149.99 this summer ( AU availability is yet to be confirmed ) . For starters , the syntax of your voice interactions with Spider-Man has to be quite specific to what the toy ’ s expecting to hear in order to get a response . That ’ ll be aided by prompts from the accompanying mobile app ( which will also track your progress through the voice missions ) but will hinder naturalistic interactions with the toy . Still , there ’ s a lot of promise here , especially when the line almost-inevitably expands to include the wider Marvel roster . We 'll have more on the Sphero Spider-Man shortly , so keep checking back for further updates .

Nextbit Robin is on sale today in a very temporary Amazon Deal of the Day , and it 's one you may want to think about if you 're intrigued by its 'unlimited storage . ' This Android phone costs $ 117 today only through Amazon , yet it launched at $ 364.39 , according to the original list price . That 's a huge savings in a little over one year of it being in consumers ' hands . Read more : Razer Blade 2019 review Other stores have given the Nextbit Robin a price drop too , however , we 've seen retailers like Best Buy drop it down to around $ 170 , not Amazon 's $ 117 . The Nexbit Robin touts unlimited cloud storage , well beyond its 32GB of internal space . Everything can be seamlessly stored on the cloud , including your apps . It comes with 100GB of free cloud storage , and Nextbit marketed this as endless since you can always upgrade your remotely-located phone storage for a price . Owning Nextbit 's first phone on the cheap may be most appealing to collectors . It 's also likely their last , as the start-up company was bought by Razer in January . This phone may serve as the foundation to a potential Razer phone that we 're eagerly awaiting . We have n't seen it at E3 2017 , but we 're keeping our eyes peeled at Razer events throughout the year .

When you finish the survey , you 'll get to read your full profile in your Developer Scorecard , including a description of your character . Your profile will also include graphs showing how your responses compare to other developers ' answers in your country , so you 'll get a sense of how you compare to other devs . TechRadar readers who will participate in the survey will be entered into a prize draw for a $ 200 Amazon voucher - so our community will have at least one winner ! Participants can also in one of the many prizes available including an iPhone 7 , a Pixel phone 32GB , an Oculus Rift , a Surface Pro 3 , a 12-month Xbox Live Gold Membership , and more . As always , VisionMobile will publish the key findings from the survey in the form of The State of the Developer Nation free report , come August . If you contribute , you 'll be among the first to get a copy ! These findings will include interesting insights to help you excel in your career in software development . For example , the previous survey showed that region and software sector are two of the most significant factors in determining developer salaries . “ The best-earning developers in our survey – those in the top 10 % – often earn tens and sometimes hundreds of times as much as the least well-off , i.e . the bottom decile . Part of this gap is location-driven , but a developer ’ s skill , knowledge , and reputation do matter , so investing in them will pay off . ” We know we have already told you , but please don ’ t forget ... The survey is full of jokes - developer jokes . You know - the ones everybody else usually doesn ’ t get .
Qualcomm , the manufacturer behind the mobile-focussed Snapdragon processors , is investing big into its Smart Audio Platform , which it ’ s hoping will power the next generation of voice-assistant equipped devices . The new chips are built to integrate with multiple voice assistants , including Google Assistant and Alexa , and support multiple configurations of microphones , allowing it to vary between , for example , Google Home ’ s 2-microphone array and the Amazon Echo ’ s 7 . Specific technologies enabled by the chips include far-field noise cancellation to allow a device ’ s microphones to be able to hear your voice from across the room , keyword detection , and voice biometrics ( to allow a speaker to potentially recognize different voices like Google Home ) . Having these technologies built into the chip should allow different manufacturers to save a lot of time bringing their connected devices to market . Amazon has already encouraged other companies to integrate Alexa into their products , and has even made its own 7-microphone array available to manufacturers . Similarly , Google is also partnering with other device manufacturers to equip their devices with its smart assistant . Qualcomm ’ s technology is aiming to make it even easier for manufacturers to build in the technology . Given that the goal appears to be equipping every speaker in your house with a voice assistant , this could spell the end for dedicated voice assistant devices such as the original Echo and Google Home . After all , if , in the future , the soundbar in my living room , DAB radio on my bedside table and connected multi-room speaker in my kitchen are all going to be equipped with Alexa , then what purpose does an Amazon Echo serve ? In this context , the original devices seem more like a trogan horse for the technology rather than the end-goal . For its part , Amazon appears to be working to ensure that the Echo does more than simply act as a speaker such as building in cameras and touchscreens with the Echo Look and Echo Show . But in the long term could we see the eventual extinction of dedicated voice assistant device , even as the likes of Alexa and Google Assistant become ever-more common features in the modern smart home ? Only time will tell .

While Amazon adding phone calls and messaging to its Echo speakers was a handy feature , a sorely-needed addition to Alexa 's newest skill has finally arrived . As seen in the update notes on Alexa 's App Store page , users can finally block specific contacts from reaching them via calls or messaging . From the outset , Alexa users could n't prevent contacts from reaching them through Echo calling and messaging — making it a potential privacy headache for those who 'd rather not be bothered through a literal speaker in their home , according to The Verge . Now , you can scroll through your contacts list on the Alexa app and prevent any scammers or ne'er-do-wells from calling or messaging you by hitting the freshly minted `` Block Contacts '' button . The update is seemingly only available for the iOS version of the Alexa app at the moment , with the Android version still awaiting call-blocking . In the meantime , feel free to consult our guide to securing Alexa to make sure Amazon 's digital assistant is n't assisting those you 'd rather not associate with .

HTC U11 is the most interesting phone we 've test from HTC in several years , and it 's now shipping to pre-order customers and available to buy immediately in the US today – if you can find it in stock . There 's good news if you 're looking to purchase the HTC U11 unlocked and shop on Amazon , because it 's still available to ship right away in most colors . It costs the normal $ 649 for the no contract HTC U11 and comes with free one-day shipping for Amazon Prime customers . The phone in Sapphire Blue , the color you really want ( of course ) takes an extra day or two to ship , according to Amazon . This contrasts with the official HTC website , where the HTC U11 is sold out for the next two to four weeks . You can order the phone right now , but you 're going to have to wait anywhere from 14 to 30 days for it . There 's a big difference between the HTC U11 unlocked and the HTC U11 on Sprint that you should know about before making your decision . The unlocked version works with Verizon , AT & T , T-Mobile and other carriers . It 's not compatible with Sprint , and Amazon does n't offer a Sprint version . If you 're a Sprint customer and eager to get the HTC U11 , we suggest buying it from the official Sprint website , where it is in stock ( again , unlike the HTC site ) . You can buy it from Sprint for full price of $ 696 or $ 29 a month spread out over the course of 24 months . You will get carrier bloatware and it is locked , however . To find out what makes the HTC U11 unique , read up on our hands-on review of the company 's new standout ( and squeezable ) smartphone .

For months , analysts all over the industry foretold the coming of the Siri Speaker – a Wi-Fi audio device from Apple that had a home assistant baked right in . They said it would be Apple ’ s answer to the Amazon Echo or the Google Home , and those who were close to it said those were the products Apple engineers looked to emulate . But they were wrong : HomePod isn ’ t an Amazon Echo rival . It ’ s a Sonos killer . Here ’ s the thing , if Apple was targeting the Google Home or Amazon Echo , it failed . It failed miserably . Not only are those two speakers substantially cheaper than the $ 349 ( about £270 or AU $ 460 ) Apple HomePod , but the HomePod feels far behind in terms of connectivity . ( Amazon ’ s new Echo has a screen , while Home has deep Chromecast functionality . ) But the Apple HomePod doesn ’ t line-up with those . The better comparison , and the one we all should ’ ve made from the beginning , is to a Sonos Play:3 speaker . Instead of seeing the HomePod as a Siri Speaker , a device that feels late and underdressed to a party , see it as the evolution of the connected Wi-Fi speaker – loaded to the gills with a seven beam-forming tweeter array , a 4-inch upward-facing woofer and a library of 4 million songs . So how does Apple plan on committing the homicide ? It seems like the answer lies in AirPlay , that open standard Apple has been using for ages to tether devices together . Apple ’ s announcement of AirPlay 2.0 was something it breezed through during Monday ’ s WWDC keynote . It announced the new capabilities almost dutifully , before pressing on to the New iPad Pro ( really , Apple ? That ’ s the best name you could come up with ? ) and the improvements coming to the Metal SDK . The better comparison , and the one we all should ’ ve made from the beginning , is to a Sonos Play:3 speaker . Don ’ t get me wrong , I love hearing about how Apple is diving into VR with the HTC Vive , or how great macOS 10.13 High Sierra is going to be . I do . But when you ’ re telling us that all AirPlay 2.0 speakers will be controllable by Siri and any AirPlay speaker can be accessed and grouped by the Home app , we should probably spend a few minutes on that . If it works as described , AirPlay could replace every first-party app from audio makers like Bose , Sonos , Ultimate Ears and dozens of others . They ’ ll have no purpose any more . Unlimited control of speaker groupings and music playback were the features that built Sonos as a brand 15 years ago , and now Apple is stealing that thunder . I ’ ve described certain speakers “ all flash and no thunder ” in the past . When I said it , I meant that the speaker spent so much time honing its image or its feature set , it forgot what the most important aspect of a speaker should be : sound quality . ( Cough , Beats , cough . ) From the spec sheet , that ’ s exactly the opposite of what Apple is doing with the HomePod . It has a seven beam-tweeter array , each with their own drivers , and a high-excursion woofer . It has an Apple A8 Chip inside that will intelligently sculpt sound to match the environment it ’ s in . It uses an advanced algorithm that continuously analyzes the music and dynamically tunes the low frequencies for distortion-free sound . It can analyze the acoustics of a room , adjust the sound based on the speaker ’ s location and steer the music in the right direction . It could be a great-sounding speaker . And if it is , then Sonos is in real trouble . But more to my point , it doesn ’ t seem fair to compare the HomePod to the Google Home or Amazon Echo . The Home , for example , has a 2 inch driver and dual 2 inch passive radiators while the Echo uses one 2.0 inch tweeter and a built-in 2.5 inch woofer . The difference between these “ AI first , sound quality second ” products and Apple ’ s HomePod should be night and day . Instead of seeing Siri as the HomePod ’ s main purpose , look at it like the cherry on top of a delicious , Wi-Fi connected cake : It can clearly integrate with dozens of smart home appliances right out of the gate and answer any questions you might have , but those are n't the sorts of things that the HomePod will excel at . Amazon ’ s Alexa and Google Assistant are going to be smarter , more clever and more intuitive than anything Apple puts into the HomePod . In terms of smart home functionality , HomeKit isn ’ t a resounding success yet , and while it ’ s well supported it doesn ’ t have the same enthusiasm behind it that Samsung ’ s SmartThings platform has . Similarly , while I expect some improvements to be made to Siri before the HomePod ’ s launch in December of this year , I fully expect it to be the hit-or-miss virtual assistant I have on my iPhone today . With over two years in public development and many more behind closed doors , Amazon ’ s Alexa and Google Assistant are going to be smarter , more clever and more intuitive than anything Apple puts into the HomePod . I have very little doubt about that . In summary ? Calling it a Siri Speaker belittles the HomePod ’ s greatest strengths . It ’ s not an AI-equipped smart speaker but a relatively bold evolution of the Wi-Fi speaker that now comes with a still-in-development virtual assistant .
Amazon ’ s first and only stint with making a smartphone did not go so well . But , rumor has it that the company may be taking another swing with new Android devices codenamed “ Ice ” . While we haven ’ t seen any leaks showing off what the phones will look like , the biggest difference between the new effort and the Amazon Fire Phone appears to be the adoption of a less customized take on Android and the ever-popular Google Mobile Services suite , containing apps like Gmail , Google Play Store and more . According to insiders familiar with the project , Amazon is currently testing 5.2-inch and 5.5-inch devices for release in emerging markets . Inside of the phones is reported to be a 13MP camera , Snapdragon 435 , 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage , which is half of what the Amazon Fire Phone had back in 2014 . While Amazon ’ s early phone efforts went up against the flagships of the time , these are rumored to launch around the sub- $ 100 price point . That said , they are said to be currently testing with Android Nougat , which would make them among the cheapest phones to come with the latest software . If you remember ( maybe it ’ s best that you don ’ t ) , the Amazon Fire Phone ran a heavily customized version of Android , like it does with the Amazon Fire tablets . As such , the amount of apps available was limited by a tremendous deal . While this seems to work well enough in the tablet space , it didn ’ t go over well in the phone market . But given the new rumors , Amazon could be changing its practices . The source stated that not only do the test devices run Android Nougat , they feature the Google Assistant . Mysteriously out of sight is Alexa , Amazon ’ s own virtual assistant that has popped up on the scene following the Fire Phone ’ s demise . It seems odd that these new phones wouldn ’ t feature Alexa , but that is likely to change in the future . That is , if we hear more about these devices .

After surpassing 10,000 skills earlier this year , Amazon is giving its Alexa digital assistant yet another ability , making it even more useful for everyday use . Starting today , the assistant that powers Amazon 's Echo smart speakers and other devices can now set reminders and named timers to help keep you on track . With reminders , you can ask Alexa to remember something for the future — whether it be to check on the oven in just five minutes or to send a card to Dad next week so that it arrives in time for Father 's Day . While Alexa was able to set timers before its latest update , the skill has now expanded with the ability to give each timer a name . For example , you can use two separate timers for doing laundry and then ask Alexa how much time is left for the `` washer timer , '' as opposed to the `` dryer timer . '' Reminders and specified timers are rolling out today to Alexa users in the US and are expected to reach other regions over the next few weeks . Alexa users can anticipate even more useful skills heading their way in the coming months , such as voice notifications for certain skills and hands-free calling . Via The Verge
It can already read your Google Calendar 's events , and tap into Microsoft 's cloud Windows calendar too . Now Amazon is sending out an update to its Amazon Echo devices that will let you use the voice-activated speaker to nab details from Apple iCloud calendar as well . Alexa can now hook up with Apple 's service , letting it read out events and add appointments through voice commands . All you need to do is make sure two-factor authentication is activated on your Apple devices , and then , once accounts are linked up , you 'll see Alexa 's handiwork reflected across all your Apple products . With the rumors surrounding Apple 's own Siri-powered entry into the smart speaker market heating up , Amazon 's announcement is interestingly timed . It 's almost as if Amazon wants people invested in Apple 's eco-system to know that there 's an alternative to the Cupertino company 's wares . Apple is expected to release a smart speaker that feeds off its Siri voice-activated assistant at this year 's WWDC 2017 event . While concrete design details are scarce , it 's now thought the speaker has entered mass production ahead of a full-blown reveal . Meanwhile , Amazon 's expanded the Echo range to include the Echo Look and the Echo Show – one sporting a fashion conscious camera , the other a tablet-like display . Neither have had the same same initial `` wow '' factor the Echo did , so the pressure may be on at Amazon HQ .

I had an epiphany this week , while watching one of the worst movies you are likely to see this year . It was The Circle ( it 's available to view on Netflix if you fancy wasting your life ) a movie so terrible it 's no surprise that everyone in it has stopped talking about it and probably phoning IMDb right now to get it erased from their CVs . It has all the hallmarks of a successful movie : it 's based on a best-selling novel , features John Boyega and Emma Watson - two great actors who have starred in the world 's biggest franchises - and even Tom Hanks makes an appearance . Anyway , back to the epiphany . I was watching The Circle and it dawned on me : Every actor , no matter how good , is one step away from making a bad movie and it probably is n't their fault . With The Circle , the actors were n't awful but the script made them look awful . The film looked great , but it was an aimless mess of cliches and inconsistencies . With these pieces of the filmmaking puzzle missing , it meant The Circle ended up being pap . Despite this The Circle will never be seen as a BAD movie , just a bad one . A BAD movie - one that is certain to have a place in Not On My Watch - needs all or a combination of the following : - Not one title , but a variety for all the times it 's been re-released - A title with the words ( or variants of ) : Death , Blood , Sexy , Killer , Giant , Attack . - Terrible acting , the type that makes Nic Cage look reserved and stately . - A movie that does n't get better no matter how much alcohol you 've consumed . - Special effects not made on a computer but sketched out , faxed then plonked on to acetate for the director to do as they wish . - Boobs . - More boobs . - No plot . - A plot so detailed it takes three hours to explain it . - A mention in Not On My Watch . With this in mind , here are our four picks for this week . The Premise : A ninja takes on the Ku Klux Klan in a no-holds barred tussle between murderers who hide behind robes and their mystic beliefs and the Ku Klux Klan . Ninjas , eh ? They bloody love a bit of vengeance and Jesse in Ninja Vengeance is of no exception . His reason for retribution is a sound one , though - he witnesses a black man die at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan so decides to take the law into his own hands and use his ninjutsu powers to kick some racist wizard butt . The only problem is , he 's not a very good fighter . Scene after scene is him getting his ass handed to him . Whether locals , clansmen or even his own martial arts teacher , he 's the meat to their beat . At least when he 's being beaten up it stops Jesse from speaking , walking or trying to act - all are more painful to watch than his hilarious inability to take a punch without writhing on the floor in agony . Best watched when : you have watched every other ninja film , even the one with Chris Farley , and have to complete the collection or the kidnappers who have your mother will act upon their threats . The Premise : A ragtag group of '80s fashionistas travel to the centre of the world where they find a long-forgotten race of ragtag '80s fashionistas . Journey to the Center of the Earth is a cut-and-shut job of a movie - even the director admits it . It 's essentially 10 minutes of his footage spliced with a completely different movie to fulfil contractual nonsense with the distributer , none other than the enfant terrible of movie making Canon Films . Not that we are letting the filmmakers off with that excuse . A terrible movie is still a terrible movie . EastEnders , The Bill and Casualty alumni Nicola Cowper stars as a British nanny who gets kicked out of her job for being terrible . Naturally she decides to take a nanny job for an off-the-rails rockstar in Hawaii , where she ends up looking after his dog . As it 's Hawaii , she then visits a volcano with a group of folks straight out of Cindy Lauper 's Girls Just Want To Have Fun music video and find out it 's a portal to the long lost world of Atlantis . After that it 's a rigid rendition of the Jules Verne classic , including a faithful adaptation of that famous scene where a mad professor wants to clone Dancing With The Stars legend Kathy Ireland who just happens to be the first human in the world . Nothing makes sense in this movie , but there is a lovely dog in it . Best watched when : you have journeyed to the centre of the earth and liquid magma is slowly eating away at your body , having already taken your eyes . The Premise : There 's a creature in a lake . I like the found footage genre . When done right you can have a fantastically creepy movie but when done badly it looks like something your nan shoots by mistake when she 's trying to text someone with the phone you told her to get because it will change her life . Creature Lake has been made by nan , unfortunately . It starts of with promise - a bunch of bros descend to a cabin by a lake but it turns out that every single one of them will annoy the crap out of you every single time they are on the screen . Given this is a film that 's 95 % them , it means the movie entirely consists of jerky handheld shots of a bunch of jerks . At least there 's a bit of nudity to perk things up but this excitement is soon dampened when we finally get to see the CG-why ? creature . Best watched when : you actually found the footage of this movie in a skip and are watching out of pure curiosity why someone would throw a whole film away . The Premise : Sol is a man with a robot arm . He 's also someone stranded in the desert with a bunch of enemies for company who have watched far too many Mad Max movies . Enemy Empire was originally called Furious Road , which tells you all you need to know about this mock Mad Max mess around . It stars Tristan James Butler , you may know him from such films as Alien Theory and Riftwood Bend , as Sol an escaped prisoner who just so happens to have a robotic arm much like Furiosa in , well , you get the idea . He 's stranded in a dystopian world that looks like it 's been shot in some sand dunes , with a cast that consists of three people all dressed like extras from a Village People shoot . The plot involves a king who likes to annoy people and , for the love of everything people , Mad Max : Fury Road is also on Prime , watch that instead of this bland sand story . Best watched when : you are just about to partake in an MMA fight but you 've lost your mojo and need something to make you angry , no , furious in a very short amount of time . Marc Chacksfield is a former film journalist ( and TechRadar 's global managing editor ) who is already regretting agreeing to watch terrible movies for the sake of his column Not On My Watch .

Amazon has launched a new service called Hub , which is a locker system that allows delivery people to drop off parcels for you even when you aren ’ t home . The units currently start at six feet wide , and include a number of lockers with a touch screen embedded in the middle of the unit . Once your parcel has been delivered , you get a notification with a code . You put the code into The Hub and your locker panel will open revealing your delivery . They appear to be similar to Amazon 's existing parcel drop off stations which have been installed in a number of public locations in the UK and US . What is interesting about the new service is that Amazon is allowing the locker to be used by any delivery service . According to the official site : “ Accepting deliveries from all carriers , Hub by Amazon can free you and your staff from daily package management . ” From looking at the pictures , it does seem as though the units are the same as the ones being used in the Amazon Lockers service , which allows you to choose an Amazon Locker placed in a public location as your delivery option rather than your address , then works in the same way as Hub . Given the size of Hub and the wording on the site , it is obviously a service that is tailored towards apartment blocks rather than individual properties . There are indoor and outdoor versions of Hub , with the outdoor version sitting at a hefty seven foot three inches tall . The indoor version starts at six feet nine inches high , and just shy of two feet deep , with 42 compartments of differing sizes to cater for diverse parcel dimensions . There is an expander segment that is three feet wide that adds a further 23 compartments . If we ’ re right and they are the same units as the Amazon Lockers , the units will be able to accommodate parcels with dimensions up to 42 cm x 35 cm x 32 cm , so you may still have to stay home to accept the delivery of that outdoor trampoline you ordered while drunkenly late-night shopping to make the pain go away . At the moment it ’ s unclear who will cover the costs of Hub . There is the possibility that the building pays to install and maintain it , that other delivery services will pay for use of the unit , or that it will be a service the user has to pay for . We have contacted Amazon for clarification on this point . Source Hub by Amazon

It ’ s finally happened . Amazon and Netflix ’ s algorithms have caught up with my bad movie watching and now they are delivering dross to me on a daily basis . When I first started writing Not On My Watch , I had to dive deep into both services to unearth the terrors within . I saw myself as as one of those mystical freedivers who swim to the bottom of an azure ocean to find that big ol ’ oyster shell that contains a majestic pearl . The difference being that I am no beautiful freediver but a mere failed film journalist sitting in my pants late at night , the seedy belly of streaming services my azure ocean , the crud of the movie crop my pathetic pearl . Now these awful movies are served to me wearing a frayed bow . My Netflix and Amazon homescreens are covered in curated crap . I have to now explain to my wife quite why such classics as Milfs Vs Zombies , Strip Club Massacre and Werewolf Bitches from Outer Space are now in my ‘ recommended for you ’ section . Joy of joys . I ’ m in too deep , folks , there ’ s no way out so I may as well continue offering up you lovely bunch of Not On My Watchers the very worst movies on Amazon Prime and Netflix you can view with your own eyes . A word of warning : this is my life now , but you can still get out while the going ’ s good . I can not . I am a trader of the terrible , a hawker of the horrible , a vender of the vile . And , with that , on the menu this week are vampiric samurais , abysmal animated animal antics and the worst parody movie you will ever see - so much so I ’ m convinced it ’ s a parody of parody movies , made with the sole intention of making all other parody movies , even Meet The Spartans , look like Oscar contenders . Enjoy . Endure . Adieu . The Premise : Shira is part vampire , part samurai , all sass . She 's meant to be the future leader/mother of day walking vampires but some idiot named Kristoff is hell-bent on making sure that never happens . Shira The Vampire Samurai begins at a frenetic pace . There 's a lot of running , everyone is running , so much running and drumming , drumming and running . Then , once the cameraman gets everything into focus - it takes a while - it 's revealed that it 's ninjas and samurais that are running , chasing each other . At this point I 'm hooked . Ninjas ! Samurais ! I 've got this movie all wrong , it 's not a B- movie but a portentous overview of the class system of feudal Japan in 1100AD , where the ninjas are the kick-ass lower class and the samurai are militia of a better stock . How wrong I was . The title sequence kicks in and lasts so long I thought the tape was stuck , then remembered we do n't use tape anymore but ones and noughts , and everything falls apart . You see there are two things Shira is : a vampire and a samurai . And one thing she is not : an actress . As well as sucking blood , she sucks the life out of this entire movie . And the plot does n't help either . Instead of staying in historic Japan , things shift to the modern world where Shira tries out as a stripper , has sex with a man with flesh-coloured balloons for arms ( they maybe muscles , if they are they 're weird muscles ) and meets Kristoff who makes whiny noises when he fights . And that concludes how to make a movie with samurai , ninjas and vampires , well , suck . Best watched when : you 're a vampire , have been alive for centuries and watched and read everything the world has to offer . Only then should you buy a Prime subscription and take this one for a spin . The Premise : A sleepy village in England has a terrible secret : it 's filled with werewolves ... and people who think they are filmmakers but are definitely not . Crying Wolf begins with two middle-aged people dropping double entendres aplenty in an antique shop about a book . They manage to equate buying a book to sex , with classic lines such as ( said in hushed sexy tones ) : `` I love her for her prose '' and `` I buy second hand versions of her books because the new ones are wrapped in plastic to protect their posterity '' . Hubba hubba . We then get a homage to a James Bond credit sequences of old , where silhouettes of ladies dance to a tuneless theme . But this time the silhouettes contain piles of offal and blood . Beautiful . And just like a James Bond movie , the cast eventually say the name of the movie , or at least a version of it , with the fantastic line : `` Being a serial prankster , no one listened to him . Andy had cried wolf once too often . '' That is the extent of fun you will have with Crying Wolf , a horror comedy so insipid that its real frights will make you laugh and its jokes will scare you off . Wait , that means it 's actually doing its job as a horror comedy ... now I do n't know whether to love it or hate it . I 'm so confused . Best watched when : you 're the director and you have to watch the rushes as you are making the film . The Premise : A video guy gets lost delivering movies and subsequently turns into a monster hunter . This film offends me on many levels . I grew up with all the horror characters Stan Helsing parodies . Freddy was my friend at secondary school , Jason and his machete saw me through college and Chucky was the doll I cuddled at night . So , seeing these horror icons in a movie as bad as Stan Helsing is just plain wrong . The film tries to lampoon the horror genre , seemingly forgetting Scary Movie did the same thing seven years previous , but it backfires so badly that it ends up being more of a mess than what happens to your average non-virgin teenager visiting Camp Crystal Lake . It 's not a movie , it 's a set of skits stuck together by a gunk of toilet humour and sex jokes . Stan Helsing is seemingly void of actors and a script . It 's as if the camera crew turned up and just demanded random people did something in front of the camera , while someone dressed as Leatherface mucks around in the background with a leaf blower and Chucky pretends to give someone head . To put it into context : this movie is worse than Jason X . Best watched when : you have just been slaughtered by Freddy 's knife glove . The Premise : Pegasus has a fight with a chimera , hilarity ensues . For the most part of Pegasus Vs Chimera , Pegasus is just a white horse . The filmmakers do n't even mask the fact that they are just filming a white horse do horse things , such as canter and trot and neigh a bit . Then there is one glorious moment when Pegasus takes to the skies and develops wings , scribbled on wings . Harryhausen stop-motion this is not - it 's a scene that 's been animated by someone who has never seen a horse before , but had one described to them a few years ago by the medium of mime . It 's mesmerising to watch . When Pegasus does eventually fights the CG Chimera , it 's a scene packed with so much slow-mo , if they took it out the whole film would be 20 minutes long . And that 's what cemented this movie for me as being the greatest telling ever of this Greek myth . Best watched when : you want to understand the Greek myth of Pegasus , but need it told through the medium of the scribblings of a 10-month old baby .

Whether you 're asking how many cups there are in an ounce , or the capital city of some far flung country , Amazon 's Alexa voice assistant , as found in its Echo speakers and Fire tablets , is surprisingly adept at reciting the information you need . But with the launch of the Echo Show , the screen-packing variant on the smart speaker range , it 's now got to make that information visual too . Amazon may have found the answer in its latest purchase , Graphiq . Picked up for around $ 50 million back in May but only coming to light now , according to LA Times , the company makes interactive visualisations based on a user 's searches , with a deep knowledge graph tapping into many corners of the web . While neither company has spoken widely on the details of the purchase , it seems a perfect match for the audio-driven capabilities of Alexa . Graphiq 's ability to pair a search with a visual breakdown of facts and info makes it well suited to an Amazon range increasingly pairing audio feedback with visual cues . The potentially interactive nature , if converted into Alexa 's new card format , would allow Amazon to dig deeper into a user 's tastes too , watching the tangents they follow to better serve products of interest up for purchase . Graphiq 's product comparison capabilities would be particularly useful here . Graphiq has more than 100 employees , the expectation now being that many will transition over to Alexa projects .

Alexa is headed to Amazon 's Android shopping app beginning this week , joining Amazon Echo speakers and iPhones as yet one more place where the digital assistant can try to make its mark . Alexa 's Android arrival comes via the dedicated Amazon Shopping app . The app 's Google Play Store listing indicates it was updated on July 19 , though there 's no official mention of Alexa integration in the description , so it could be updated again when Alexa officially arrives . Amazon told us when Alexa launched on iOS in March that an Android version was in the works , and today Amazon confirmed Alexa 's arrival on the Google operating system to TechCrunch . Just as it does on iOS , Alexa in the Android app works much the same as it does on Echo . It can perform tasks like check the weather , traffic and news , tell jokes , stream music , track past Amazon orders , and even control smart home gadgets . Alexa on Android can also perform various skills , like launch the Netflix app and order you Starbucks . Alexa inside the Amazon shopping app on Android looks to be slowly making its way out to users . While it may not be feature-full enough or , you know , natively built-in , to convince you to wholly switch from Siri or Google Assistant , slipping Alexa into the major mobile ecosystems is a smart way for Amazon to expose its assistant to more people . While there is a dedicated Alexa app , it has between 5,000,000 - 10,000,000 installs on Android , compared to the Amazon Shopping app 's 100,000,000 - 500,000,000 installs . Yeah , we can see what Amazon 's thinking here .
After numerous reports that Samsung is developing an Amazon Echo competitor equipped with the company 's own Bixby voice assistant , a new source has claimed that the plans have now been dropped . Speaking to the Korea Herald the unnamed source said , `` Samsung currently does not view Al speakers as marketable , as the global market is already dominated by unbeatable Amazon and the Korean market is too small to make profits . '' Earlier this week , Samsung rolled out Bixby to English-speaking markets for the first time , suggesting that the voice assistant has a future , just not necessarily in the home as a smart speaker . In SmartThings , Samsung already has a robust smart home ecosystem , but it appears this is not enough to give it the confidence to take on Amazon . Amazon Alexa already has a marketplace of 10,000 skills , allowing it to interface with everything from robot vacuum cleaners , to routers . It will be tough for any smart speaker to catch up with Amazon 's hefty lead , and it looks like Samsung does n't think the fight will be worthwhile .

Amazon may already be the go-to for online shopping , but the retail giant looks as though it wants to be a bigger part of your spending habits — even when shopping offline . Amazon has begun rolling out Amazon Pay Places , a new feature that allows Amazon customers to make and purchase orders at brick-and-mortar establishments , according to TechCrunch . The system is sort-of an extension of Amazon Pay , which is akin to PayPal by allowing online retailers to accept payments though customers ' Amazon accounts . Rather than internet stores , however , Amazon Pay Places uses customer 's payment credentials at real-life locations , similar to mobile payment services like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay . Though available starting today , Amazon 's new payment system is still in its relative infancy . At the time of writing , ordering via Amazon Pay Places is only available at select , US-based TGI Friday 's restaurants in Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington D.C. , Richmond , Virginia and Wilkes-Barre , Pennsylvania . For those on the East Coast just dying for franchise-quality pub food , Amazon Pay Places can be accessed via Amazon 's mobile app , under “ Programs & Features ” in the menu . As for if ( or , more likely , when ) Amazon expands its new feature out to more businesses , we 'll just have to wait and see . That said , the move to physical stores should n't surprise many — the company 's bold $ 13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods last month is no small sign that Amazon wants to be just as much an in-person shopping hub as it is an online one .

Update July 18 : It turns out Amazon has been working on a trial of a meal kit service , in the US in very selected areas . One Seattle-based customer reached out to GeekWire to detail his experience with the service , which looks to entail ordering ingredients for one meal at a time to be delivered and prepared at home . We 'll keep you updated on whether or when Amazon plans to roll out the service more widely . Original article below ... Following Amazon 's massive purchase of Whole Foods for $ 13.7 billion , it looks like the next step in the retail giant 's plan for dietary domination involves prepared meal kits . Amazon has filed for a trademark using the phrase 'We do the prep . You be the chef , ' according to TechCrunch . The trademark describes a service that provides 'prepared food kits ' that can be turned into a meal out of the box . This sounds similar to meal kit delivery services like HelloFresh and Blue Apron ( which only operates in the US at the moment ) , which regularly mail groceries to a customer 's doorstep so they can cook dishes without any extra trips to the store . Other slogans like 'We prep . You cook ' and 'No-line meal kits ' were also applied for trademarking by Amazon . This makes it all the more likely the big box behemoth is cooking up a meal delivery service of its own . Though Amazon has yet to confirm any sort of meal-in-a-box delivery service plans ( the trademark applications are still pending at the time of writing ) , the move would be very much within the company 's scope of operations . Between Amazon Fresh mailing food staples to your door , the Amazon Dash Wand enabling you to reorder said food with a single scan , and even its own automated grocery stores on the way , it 's clear that Amazon 's next frontier is ruling pantries just like it rules , well , everything else .
Scammers are cashing in on the popularity of AMD ’ s new Ryzen processors , with reports of fake CPUs being sold on Amazon . There ’ s nothing new here in actual fact – there ’ s been a long and unfortunate history of selling cheap processors in the packaging of more expensive models – and in this case , as PC Gamer reports , there have been several incidents where customers have ordered a Ryzen 7 1700 CPU on Amazon and have received an Intel Celeron chip instead . The fake Intel CPU comes in AMD ’ s correct packaging and has the Ryzen logo on it , but a closer inspection of the product reveals that logo is just a sticker . There are other clear clues that this is a fake , including the fact that there are no pins on the bottom of the chip , and the wrong heatsink is bundled with the processor , plus the package the chip came in has obviously been tampered with . Such fakes – which have also been reported elsewhere on the net – may have been purchased from third-party sellers on Amazon Marketplace , or may have been bought directly from Amazon itself . Not that the retail giant is trying to scam folks , of course , but it ’ s selling products which have been returned ( and the original buyer has switched the processor for an old cheapo model before returning it ) . Nothing is all that clear here , and at this point , it seems likely that both the above possibilities could be the case . There ’ s even discussion on Reddit of this being some kind of large-scale fraud operation , although it ’ s too early to draw any conclusions like that in our opinion . At any rate , in the case of that particular Reddit thread , Amazon quickly sorted things , implementing a full refund and giving the buyer a gift card as well , by all accounts . So , if you are buying a Ryzen processor on Amazon – or indeed from a third-party seller on another site such as eBay – this is an issue clearly worth bearing in mind . Of course , when using a third-party seller , it ’ s worth choosing one with a large amount of positive feedback ( although as mentioned , these counterfeit processors can potentially come direct from Amazon – as resold returns – as well ) . This sort of scam has been pulled off with graphics cards in the past , as well , and in far more sophisticated forms with CPUs . In this case , at least the fakes are crude and easily spotted , plus of course the counterfeit chip won ’ t even fit in a Ryzen socket on the motherboard . Top Image Credit : sh00ter999 ( Reddit )

Rumors over the weekend suggested Amazon is hard at work on its own messaging platform to compete with the likes of Facebook , WhatsApp and maybe even workplace solutions like Slack . It ’ s rumored to be called Anytime and it was reported by AFTV News after Amazon began surveying customers about potential innovative features for the new service . The leak has suggested a variety of features for the service with ideas such as video and voice chat , the ability to play games with your friends and even put filters over photos within the app . Despite that , Amazon will have a lot of work ahead of it to beat the current big names in the space , considering Google Allo even struggled to make an impact when it launched last year . There 's currently no word on when Anytime will be officially announced or when it will be released to the public , but considering Amazon is still surveying customers for potential features we can speculate the launch will be at the end of this year or even pushed into 2018 . Here are all the features we think Amazon may be able to use to get ahead of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger . According to the leak , you won ’ t need to have your phone number attached to your Amazon account to use the service . Instead you ’ ll be able to communicate with just your friend 's name . WhatsApp needs your phone number to set up your account , while Facebook Messenger also requests your number and asks to be the default app for SMS , so it would make sense for Amazon to avoid this . The leak has a section called “ private and secure ” that suggests encryption will be a part of the service , but that it won ’ t be used across the whole messaging app . The Anytime marketing material says you can “ encrypt important messages ( like bank account details ) ” . We ’ d prefer to see Amazon introduce encryption as standard across all of its messaging though , so you don ’ t have to think about when you want to keep details secret . That ’ s the only way it ’ ll keep pace with WhatsApp . GIF integration is teased in the leaked details for Amazon Anytime and while Facebook and WhatsApp both offer it as an option , it ’ s hidden away in each . You have to click quite a few times throughout both apps to be able to find GIFs , but here we hope it ’ s something you can easily find and which doesn ’ t take much effort to do , so we 're more encouraged to send everyone appropriate moving images . It ’ s not explicitly stated in the leaked details , but we ’ d expect Amazon to integrate its own voice assistant Alexa into the app directly . That would give you access to Alexa services on iPhone , Android and on desktop as well , and you may even be able to connect Anytime to your Amazon Echo too . One of the subheads for Anytime is “ new ways to hang out ” , followed by the suggestion that you ’ ll be able to share your location and listen to music within Anytime . But how about if Amazon takes it one step further and allows you to watch movies together ? With Prime Video a big focus of Amazon ’ s strategy , maybe the company will be able to make group chats where you can enjoy your favorite TV shows and movies at the same time ? Via : The Verge

One of Google Home 's big advantages over the Amazon Echo is its integration with Chromecast devices , which allows you to ask the speaker to play audio or visual content through TVs and stereos with the applicable hardware attached . Now the Amazon Echo is getting similar functionality , but for now it 's only going to work with Sony TVs equipped with Android TV . Available commands include turning the TV on and off , changing channels , controlling the volume , and switching inputs . It 's a decent list of commands , but it does n't quite match up to what Google Home is capable of . Using Google 's speaker , users can request specific content from video streaming services to play on a screen . For example you could ask , `` Ok Google , play Better Call Saul from Netflix on Living Room TV '' . However , Google Home does not currently offer any granular control of your TVs settings ; so it looks like the two voice assistants have different strengths and weaknesses for now . What 's surprising is that this Sony TV functionality has come to Alexa before Google Home considering that the TVs have Google Cast functionality built in . But with the smart speaker seeing rapid development , including the recent addition of multiple user support , here 's to hoping it gets similar TV controlling functionality soon .

If , by some freak of nature , you were actually born not as a flesh-and-blood baby human , but as plastic-and-circuitry remote control , I 'd be getting worried if I were you . Not for being a crime against all biological reason but as , thanks to the ever-growing presence of voice activated assistants , you 're about to go the way of the dodo . That 's a long ( and , admittedly weird ) way of teeing up the fact that Amazon has finally seen fit to allow all Alexa devices – whether it 's an Echo , Echo Dot , Fire tablet or other – to control Fire TV devices through voice commands . So whether you 're rocking an older Fire TV stick generation , or the 4K-ready Fire TV box , you 'll want to be warming up your vocal chords . Considering Amazon 's heavy inter-connected Alexa push , you may be surprised to find that the feature is n't already available on the TV range . But the update , after many a grumble from Fire-fanatics , is finally rolling out over the air . Commands including playback controls ( play , pause , rewind , etc ) are supported , letting you pause The Man in the High Castle from your bedside Amazon Echo Dot because ... why not ? The update should automatically install to idle devices , so you literally do n't have to lift a finger to take advantage of the new features .

Amazon is reportedly developing the next generation of its Echo smart speaker , an Amazon Echo 2 , and this version will be trimmer and all around better than the original Echo . What 's more , it could give Apple HomePod a run for its money . A source who saw a working model of this so-called Amazon Echo 2 spilled the details to Engadget , and the smart speaker sounds to be a significant upgrade over the two-year-old Echo currently on the market that also comes in a smaller package . In addition to more tweeters to produce better sound - a knock against the Amazon Echo now is that it 's audio quality is sub-par - this new model will apparently shave down the Echo 's ( admittedly already slender ) design . The Amazon Echo 2 will look as if a few Amazon Echo Dot speakers are stacked together , have rounded edges and , interestingly , ditch the plastic coating for a cloth-like encasement , according to the source . This last detail may be an inspiration taken from the Apple HomePod , which has a softer , fabric-like look . The new Echo 's design also sounds similar to the squat , curved design of Apple 's first smart speaker , which was unveiled last month . The mics of the Amazon Echo 2 are also reportedly undergoing a redesign , which presumably means more accurate readings of voice commands . Though Engadget 's source said some design features could change , this sounds to be a fairly close representation of what Amazon has planned for final release . The new Amazon Echo release date is said to be in the fall , which would give it a jumpstart on the Apple HomePod , which wo n't release until December . It 's unlikely the Amazon Echo 2 will begin to touch Apple HomePod 's price of $ 349 , considering the current Amazon Echo price is only $ 179.99 / £149.99 . Google Home , another small and sleek smart speaker , costs $ 129 / £129 , though it 's currently on sale for $ 99 . But it seems that Apple 's target competitor might not be the Echo at all : Apple HomePod is likely to compete more closely with Sonos speakers at its price point and with its features . But the comparison to other smart speakers for the home is unavoidable , and one that could prove difficult for Apple to overcome . It 's not impossible , mind you , but customers may be left with a choice between high-end sound and lower prices , and as smart speakers improve on all fronts , the HomePod could find itself with nowhere to go . Amazon just wrapped up its big Prime Day sale where it took 50 % off the Amazon Echo price . Could this have been a way to clear out inventory before a fall Amazon Echo 2 release ? We ca n't say for sure , but let 's just say the smart speaker stars are starting to align around Amazon introducing an upgrade soon .

Oh , boy . This may be just my third week of doing this column but already I have wasted a total of 20 hours watching movies that have turned my brain to mush . You see , I love movies and it annoys me that some of my colleagues would call me pretentious in my tastes . Just because I over analyse every film I watch , sprinkle in the occasional ‘ ennui ’ into my descriptions and enjoy the Quixotic elements of 1950 ’ s Italian neorealist cinema , particularly Federico Fellini ’ s oeuvres , doesn ’ t make my film tastes pompous . I can enjoy your Transformers with a knowing wink , and the way that series about the furiously fast has embraced postmodern tropes makes me positively giddy . The problem is the following aren ’ t laugh-out-loud awful movies , but 'sit in silence and slowly weep ' awful movies . They just aren ’ t fun to watch , believe me . Watching them is an endurance and I have endured . So , without further ado , let me tell you the tale of Adam and Eve and that famous time they met some cannibals . Streaming now on Amazon Prime The Premise : Adam and Eve just want to live a normal , care-free life but pesky prehistoric monsters and flesh-eating cannibals keep getting in the way . Adam and Eve Meet The Cannibals is a film that pretty much sticks to the Bible retelling of Adam and Eve ... with some small caveats . For instance , in this movie version Adam is born out of a disgusting meat sack , while Eve magically appears from the sand thanks to some special rain . Then there 's the bit where Adam , naked , plays with a tiger cub while Eve , naked , watches wistfully from behind a bush . So far so Biblical then , half an hour in , everything changes . Both Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit , have ferocious sex ( watched by a snake ) , Eve then steals an egg from a pterodactyl and then the cannibals come . All of this is shot through a lens so smeared in Vaseline that you fear for the camera person 's itchy skin . Best watched when : you have an essay due last minute for your theology class and you want to get the absolute truth about the story of Adam and Eve all in under two hours . *snigger* Streaming now on Amazon Prime The Premise : Zombies have fallen and it 's up to a woman with psychic powers to get them back on their feet again . Zombies Have Fallen… asleep more like , amirite ? This low-budget Brit flick focuses on a psychic woman who may hold the key to stopping a big zombie outbreak . What ensues is a lot of exposition by angry working class men with shooters and then a lot more exposition by angry posh men with shooters . There ’ s also a scene where a shop assistant reads Shooter magazine . This all culminates in this angry viewer shooting – sorry – shouting at the screen ‘ Just show me the bloody zombies ! ’ When they do arrive , they look less like zombies and more like someone who accidentally got a bit of ketchup on their chin . At least the zombies have a reason for the slow shuffling , slurred speech and vacant look in their eyes - which is more than can be said of the other ‘ actors ’ in the movie . Best watched when : some zombies have eaten your brains . And your eyes . Streaming now on Netflix The Premise : A boy develops the superpower of creating foodstuff from his bare hands . Yup , that 's the actual plot . We would all love superpowers - the ability to fly , have superhuman strength , x-ray vision… but what if you were given superpowers and those powers meant you could make food appear out of your hands ? Well , that ’ s the premise of The Adventures of Food Boy , an atrocious film that will give anyone who watches it a food intolerance . There ’ s a bit where Ezra , the boy who has the special power , is in his school bathroom and starts to shoot meat from his hands . Meat . From his hands . I ’ m sure this is meant to be some sort of me ( a ) taphor but the whole thing is so excruciating to watch , the movie is beyond explanation . Best watched when : you are in a food coma , or any other coma for that matter . Streaming now on Netflix The Premise : After a tumor is removed from his body , a 30-year-old man experiences puberty for the very first time . JK Simmons is in this . The JK Simmons that won an Oscar for his portrayal of terrifying music instructor Terence Fletcher . The JK Simmons who won a BAFTA for his work on The Closer , who embodied the role of J Jonah Jameson in Spider-Man and who is currently Commissioner Gordon in the Batman movies . Given that the multi-award-winning JK Simmons is inexplicably in a film about a man who doesn ’ t reach puberty until the age of 30 , there ’ s no denying that by starring in The Late Bloomer he dropped the ball ( s ) on this one . Best watched when : someone you love is held for ransom and the only way to get them back is to watch the full back catalogue of JK Simmons movies . And even then we would ask yourself : do you really love them that much ? Marc Chacksfield is a former film journalist ( and TechRadar 's global managing editor ) who is already regretting agreeing to watch terrible movies for the sake of his column Not On My Watch .

It ’ s hard to believe that first Amazon Kindle was announced a decade ago in 2007 , but here we are 10 years later and the e-tailer ’ s fledgling e-ink device has since seen three spin offs . With four different Kindles on the market – including the regular Kindle , Paperwhite , Voyage and Oasis – it can be hard to pick the right one for you when they all vary in price and features . Luckily , we ’ ve compared all the current models to work out the differences and help you find the right one . Screen : 6-inch 167 ppi Built-in light : No Interface : Touchscreen Battery : 4 weeks Size : 6.3 x 4.5 x 0.36-inches ( 160 x 115 x 9.1 mm ) Weight : 5.7oz/161g Price : $ 79 ( £59 , AU $ 109 ) The Kindle is your standard , entry level model . Despite being at the bottom rung of the Amazon ’ s e-reader hierarchy it has a 6-inch touchscreen boasting a 167 ppi resolution that displays decently sharp test . That said , the Kindle lacks a few features seen on its higher-end cousins including a built-in light for reading in the dark . Screen : 6-inch , 300 ppi Built-in light : 4 LEDs Interface : Touchscreen Battery : 6 weeks Size : 6.7 x 4.6 x 0.36-inches ( 169 x 117 x 9.1 mm ) Weight : 7.2oz/205 g ( Wi-Fi ) , 7.6oz/217 g ( Free 3G ) Price : $ 119 ( £109 , AU $ 179 ) The Kindle Paperwhite is a big step up from Amazon ’ s vanilla e-reader and arguably our favorite . First off , it features a newer e-ink technology named Carta that claims to offer a 50 % increase in contrast and smoother page turns . On top of this , the Paperwhite ’ s display is nearly twice as sharp as the standard Kindle – which Amazon updated in 2015 to match up with the Voyage and Oasis . It also offers a built-in lighting system , which consists of four LEDs that create a diffused illumination across the entire screen . Unlike an LCD screen you would find on an iPad or laptop , you to read for hours without the straining your eyes . Screen : 6-inch , 300 ppi Built-in light : 6 LEDs Interface : Touchscreen , page press Battery : 6 weeks Size : 6.4 x 4.5 x 0.30-inches ( 162 x 115 x 7.6 mm ) Weight : 6.3oz/180g ( Wi-Fi ) , 6.6oz/188g ( Free 3G ) Price : $ 199 ( £169 , AU $ 299 ) Although the Kindle Voyage has a lot in common with the Paperwhite , it ’ s slimmer , lighter and has a screen that gets rid of the plastic bezels for a flush glass panel . Its biggest differentiator however is a set of haptic touch controls on the side that you can press to turn pages back and forth . This e-reader also features an evener lighting system with six LEDs and an adaptive light sensor that automatically sets the screen brightness . Screen : 6-inch , 300 ppi Built-in light : 10 LEDs Interface : Touchscreen , page turn buttons Battery : 2 weeks , 9 weeks with battery cover Size : 5.6 x 4.8 x 0.13-0.33-inches ( 143 x 122 x 3.4-8.5 mm ) Weight : 4.6oz/131 g ( Wi-Fi ) , 4.7oz/133g ( Free 3G ) Price : $ 289 ( £269 , AU $ 449 ) The Oasis is the most book-like e-reader out of the Kindle family and thus has the boxiest proportions . Despite its square shape , Amazon claims the Oasis is 30 % thinner on average and 20 % lighter than any of its other e-readers . All the while it has all the features of the Voyage and a few more . The Oasis is the only Kindle that still features physical buttons for turning pages and while they might look like they ’ re right-handed biased , left-handed users can just flip the reader over for the same experience . You 'll also see the longest battery life on the Oasis but only if you keep the included cover attached .
Update : Amazon Prime Day is coming up fast ! When it hits , you should be able to find great deals on all Amazon devices – including the Amazon Fire TV Stick . Having a hard time figuring out which streaming device is right for you ? We do n't blame you . It seems like every year there are another couple of devices vying for a spot on your entertainment shelf , connected to that big glowing TV . That said , there are a handful of powerful ( and ultra-cheap ) pint-sized streaming devices out there that can deliver content from services like Netflix , Amazon Prime , Hulu and more , all without taking up serious space on the mantel . We call them streaming sticks . They aren ’ t anything new by now – the Chromecast Ultra is the third generation of Chromecast , while this year ’ s Roku Streaming Stick and the all-new Amazon Fire TV Stick are both second-gen devices – but they are super helpful . Which one is the best ? We put them head-to-head to find out . Interestingly enough , a lot has changed between streaming devices over the past two years or so in the design department . Instead of simple USB-looking sticks that simply slot into the HDMI port on your TV , we have a few different shapes to look at . Chromecast : After having started out as a USB-drive sized stick , the Chromecast now looks much more like a hockey puck . The circular device has an HDMI cable protruding out from it , and instead of jutting straight out of the HDMI port , the device kinda just hangs from its cable next to your TV . It ’ s a classy little design , and one Google doesn ’ t plan on upending with the Chromecast Ultra . The only real change is that instead of a big ol ’ Chrome logo on the front , there ’ s a simple and small Google logo , which is appearing on all of Google ’ s hardware . Size-wise , the device is 2.29 inches ( 58.20mm ) across , and a pretty small 0.53-inches ( 13.70mm ) thick . The one bit of bad news ? None of the Chromecast devices come with a remote . The Chromecast Ultra 's plug is equipped with an Ethernet port to help it deal with the amount of bandwidth required for streaming 4K content . Roku Streaming Stick : Roku , on the other hand , has stuck with the USB drive look , although it ’ s much larger than most USB drives , coming in at 5.5-inches ( 139.7mm ) long , 1.6-inches ( 40.7mm ) wide , and 0.8-inches ( 20.32mm ) thick . Unlike the Chromecast , however , the Roku Streaming Stick comes with a remote , which looks pretty simple , and has a d-pad , play/pause , and a few buttons for quickly accessing certain streaming services , like Netflix and Sling TV . We ’ ll talk a little more about the functionality of that remote later on . Amazon Fire TV : Last but not least is the Amazon Fire TV Stick , which is a similar size to the Streaming Stick , coming in at 1.5 x 5.9 x 0.7-inches ( 38.4 x 150.7 x 16.7mm ) . The Fire TV Stick also has a remote , however it has quite a few less buttons and looks a lot sleeker than the Streaming Stick ’ s remote . But wait , why exactly do you want a remote anyways ? Let ’ s spend a minute on what those remotes can do . Chromecast : First , let ’ s talk about the Chromecast – which , as mentioned , doesn ’ t have a remote , but that ’ s because it doesn ’ t need one . Unlike the other two , Chromecast uses your smartphone or computer to stream content , and as such your phone or computer is the remote . It ’ s kind of a cool concept , and while it cuts down on functionality , it makes the whole process alot easier . However , since your phone is acting as a remote over your home network , this does mean that there is often a bit of a lag between you pressing a button and it actually taking place . It 's not a deal breaker , but it makes the device feel a lot less snappy than the Amazon Fire TV stick for example . Roku and Amazon both have different ideas . If you ’ re someone who prefers using a remote , then the Streaming Stick or Fire TV Stick may be a better option . As mentioned above , the Amazon Fire TV Stick ’ s remote is quite a bit simpler than the Streaming Stick ’ s , however the Streaming Stick offers a few more quick access buttons – for example , it has a button for Netflix , Sling TV , Amazon , and Google Play . The Amazon Fire TV Stick ’ s remote opts for a simpler button selection , only offering playback controls , a navigation controller , a voice button , and user interface controls ( home , back , menu ) . However , the addition of voice controls can , at times , make up for this simplicity by allowing you to quickly control the device with the press of a single button , although it only works with a limited number of the device 's apps . If you ’ re willing to shell out an extra $ 50 , you can get a dedicated gaming controller for the Fire TV Stick , which may be a little more comfortable if you intend to play a lot of games on your device . It ’ s also important to note that you can control any of these devices through your smartphone via a dedicated app if you so choose . Roku Streaming Stick : The Roku Streaming Stick is known for its app selection – with access to a more than a hefty 1,000 apps , or channels as Roku calls them , you shouldn ’ t ever find yourself wishing you had access to more content . In the UK Roku covers most of the streaming services you could possibly need . It 's got Now TV , Netflix , Amazon Prime , catch-up apps from almost all of the major broadcasters ( aside from UKTV ) , and a large amount of extra apps besides . Chromecast : Still , there is something to be said for the Chromecast ’ s approach – if you use Google Chrome on your computer , you can stream content from literally any website . That ’ s because you can mirror a Chrome tab , so even if the service you ’ re streaming with doesn ’ t officially have support for Google Casting , you ’ ll still be able to enjoy that service ’ s content on the big screen . The same goes for mirroring the display of an Android phone . However , it 's much neater to cast directly from supported apps . Most major apps now have inbuilt Chromecast functionality , but there 's one big omission , and that 's Amazon Prime Instant video , which you 'll have to cast from a browser to watch . Amazon Fire TV Stick : Of course , if you ’ re sticking to major services like Netflix and Hulu , you won ’ t have any issues – all three of these devices offer plenty of support for the big streaming players . If , however , you ’ re more into fringe services like VUDU or the UK 's Now TV you may prefer the Roku Streaming Stick . While it ’ s nice that so many services are starting to support Google Cast and the Fire TV Stick , the real winner in the apps department is the Roku Streaming Stick . Chromecast : Let ’ s get the Chromecast out of the way first : Because of how it works , the Chromecast doesn ’ t have an interface beyond the smartphone app and a tiny button that lives in Google Chrome . If you ’ re the type of person that doesn ’ t want to mess around with a messy UI , then the Chromecast is for you . Since for the most part you 'll be using your phone to control it , this means that you can easily input text using your phone 's keyboard , rather than clumsily navigating an on-screen keyboard with a remote . Roku Streaming Stick : That said , if you ’ re against messy interfaces , then the Roku Streaming Stick is a close second – the device offers an extremely easy to use UI . The grid layout is reminiscent of Netflix , offering a grid look with a list of menu items along the left hand side . It ’ s really a very simple and clean look . The one downside of the Roku is that it does n't have any voice search functionality , which would remove the need to use an on-screen keyboard entirely . Amazon Fire TV Stick : Unfortunately , while Amazon has been getting better at refining the interface of its TV offerings , it ’ s not there just yet . The interface , while speedy to get around , can get a little confusing at times , putting the Fire TV Stick in third place when it comes to the UI . Frustratingly , while voice search is a fantastically fast way of finding content , like the universal search it only covers a fraction of the total number of apps available for the device . If you ’ re a gamer , you ’ ll probably want to steer clear of a streaming stick to satisfy your gaming needs , but that doesn ’ t mean that casual gamers can ’ t enjoy a game every now and then in between watch seasons of Game of Thrones . As mentioned before , however , if you are looking to get into some slightly more intense gaming , the Fire TV Stick might be the best choice for you , thanks to the fact that you can get a game controller specifically for the Fire TV Stick . No , it ’ s not going to offer an experience anything like what you ’ ll experience with a PlayStation 4 , but there are plenty of great games available . Neither the Roku Streaming Stick nor the Chromecast really have anything to offer in the games department . If gaming is your thing and you want to do it on your streaming stick , then the Fire TV Stick is really your only option . Chromecast : When it comes to hard specs , the Google Chromecast looks to be the real winner , despite the fact that we don ’ t even know what some of the device ’ s specs are . That ’ s because the device , in the end , is going to offer you the best experience . It supports 4K content and HDR , which means that if you have a TV that also supports them then you ’ re going to have a great viewing experience . Of course , 4K content isn ’ t low-bandwidth , so to compensate for the fact that some people won ’ t be able to stream 4K content . The Chromecast Ultra also has support for an Ethernet port , so you can plug the device straight into your internet router . Roku Streaming Stick and Amazon Fire TV Stick : The second place spot really is a toss-up between the Streaming Stick and the Amazon Fire TV Stick – while the Streaming Stick has a little more RAM , the Fire TV Stick offers voice control , which is an important thing to keep in mind . In the end , we think the voice control support puts the Fire TV stick a little over the edge -- while RAM is somewhat important , if a device is capable of streaming what you need and when you need it , it really doesn ’ t matter how much RAM it has . In case it wasn ’ t already clear , all three of these devices will require a HDMI port . If you don ’ t own a 4K TV and don ’ t intend on buying one anytime soon , perhaps the playing field is a little more level – but when it comes to hard specs , the Chromecast is the clear winner here . Of course , specs don ’ t really matter all that much if the device you ’ re looking at is way more expensive than its competitors . Interestingly enough , while the Chromecast is a little pricier than its competition , it ’ s not overly so . The new Chromecast Ultra is $ 69 ( £69 , AU $ 99 ) , which puts it a little above the Roku Streaming Stick , which runs at $ 49 ( £49 , about AU $ 62 ) and the Amazon Fire TV Stick , which will set you back $ 40 ( £35 , AU $ 39 ) . We still think the Chromecast is worth the extra cash if you have a 4K TV , but if not , the Roku Streaming Stick is worth the $ 10 extra over the Fire TV stick , especially given the amount of content available to the device . In this case , it really seems to be true that you get what you pay for . All three of these streaming sticks are pretty darn great , especially for the price they come at . Because the Chromecast Ultra offers 4K , we think it comes out on top , but thanks to the Roku ’ s giant content library , that ’ s a close second .

The 10,000-plus skills of Amazon Alexa range from making phone calls to ordering pizza , but now the digital assistant is getting yet another skill just in time for Amazon Prime Day . Amazon Echo speakers will soon receive an update that has Alexa tell users when their latest Amazon purchase is out for delivery , according to The Verge . While Alexa has always been adept at making Amazon purchases and tracking your order ( it is made by Amazon , after all ) , the update gives Echo users in particular the option to have their smart speaker 's LED ring light up yellow when a package is on its way . Of course , Alexa wo n't know the exact minute you should run out to your mailbox , but with Amazon Prime Day coming up on July 11 , we imagine plenty of Echo users will take advantage of this new feature to remind them of all the goodies they could n't keep themselves from buying .
With its end goal seeming to be to become your hub for everything in your life , Amazon this year launched a hub for streaming services it supports known as Amazon Channels . Amazon Channels is a collection of video services within a service ( Amazon Prime Video ) that ’ s within another service ( Amazon Prime ) . It sounds complicated , but you ’ ll get the hang of it . In short , binge watchers looking to cut through the noise of their myriad apps – not to mention folks who want the premium cable channel TV shows and movies without a cable bill – listen up . That 's especially for those who might want to incorporate Channels into their Amazon Prime Day deals plans . While Amazon Channels is positioned like a streaming service in the same way its own Amazon Prime Video is , this is more a collection of services than anything . You see , Amazon Channels exists within Amazon ’ s Prime Video streaming service as a hub for all of the third-party streaming services Amazon offers through the aforementioned streaming service . Amazon Channels collects and aggregates all of the streaming services Amazon supports into one page on the Amazon website and its Fire devices , offering new and old members to subscribe to or access those services , respectively , through Amazon . The result is something that looks like Netflix in what it surfaces and recommends , but includes content from any of the 100-plus “ channels ” you ’ ve subscribed to through Amazon Prime Video . Nothing ! Well , there is a catch . Amazon Channels costs nothing on its own , but is only accessible to Amazon Prime ( or solely Prime Video ) subscribers . This is yet another benefit to subscribing to Amazon ’ s paid service for guaranteed two-day shipping on all eligible orders . How much does Amazon Prime cost ? On an annual basis , you can enjoy Amazon Prime for $ 99 or £79 ( about AU $ 130 , but not yet available ) . Monthly , you can have Amazon Prime for $ 9.99 or £7.99 ( about AU $ 13.16 ) . If you don ’ t care about ordering things online and getting them quickly in addition to your complimentary Amazon Prime Video service and free unlimited photo storage , then paying for just that service and nothing else costs $ 8.99 , £5.99 or AU $ 5.99 a month . This service can not be paid for annually . But , wait : there ’ s yet another catch . If you want to access a “ channel ” or service within Amazon Channels that you ’ d normally have to pay extra to access elsewhere , you still need to pay . For instance , to get HBO Go through Amazon Channels , you ’ ll still need to pay $ 14.99 or £9.50 ( not available in Australia ) a month , only tacked onto your Amazon Prime subscription rather than directly to HBO or through your cable provider . Mind , however , that we might see these channels enjoy discounts as part of the upcoming Amazon Prime Day deals bonanza . Simply put , Amazon Channels exists on the Amazon Video section of the website as an aggregate of all the third-party services that Amazon Video now supports . From there , Amazon Channels curates those channels into genre and mood collections , as well as allows you to subscribe right then and there to new channels . Each new Channel subscription offers a free , 7-day trial , after which the bill will be automatically tacked onto your Amazon Prime subscription bill if you don ’ t cancel beforehand . Subscription prices range wildly , with the most expensive being , unsurprisingly , HBO Go . Once you choose a video to watch through Amazon Channels on your web browser , it will play through Amazon ’ s own video player . On Amazon ’ s devices , it would open the relative app to said service to play the video . If you primarily use Amazon services and devices to get your streaming content already , then Channels is a fine way to expand your repertoire of streaming apps . This is especially the case if you refuse to pay your cable company for cable TV access and thus any additional channels or services therein … but still totally pay them for internet . We thought you ’ d never ask . Here are the best Amazon Channels available in the US so far ( and no , neither Netflix nor Hulu are included ) : And here are the best Amazon Channels available in the UK so far ( again , neither Netflix nor Hulu are included ) :
The Amazon Fire TV might be getting a bit long in the tooth , but everything considered it ’ s still one of the best streaming video players on the market . So how much should you shell out for one of these awesome 4K streamers ? As of right now , the RRP ( recommended retail price ) is $ 89.99 or £79.99 in the UK . That price can fluctuate by 10-15 % depending on the week , but that ’ s around what you should expect to spend on a brand-new Amazon Fire TV . Now , that being said , before you buy an Amazon Fire TV at full price , you should probably wait until Amazon Prime Day on July 11 , 2017 which should bring a significant savings on all Amazon products . We can ’ t predict how much you ’ ll save on a new Amazon Fire TV once the deals go live , but it ’ s safe to expect a savings of around 20 % . Is the full-size Amazon Fire TV a bit too rich for your blood ? Save yourself some cash by picking up an Amazon Fire TV Stick instead . Like the Fire TV , the Fire TV Stick uses the same exact operating system , allowing you to access Alexa and watch the same content that you could on the full-size box . The one downside is that the Fire TV Stick doesn ’ t support 4K yet . How much should you spend on the pint-sized streaming device ? As of right now , the RRP of the Fire TV Stick is $ 39.99 or £39.99 in the UK . Of course , the Fire TV Stick is another product we expect to see heavily discounted on Amazon Prime Day on July 11 , so keep an eye out for those deals !
Amazon has a number of MacBook Pro discounts available on the 13.3-inch models of the late 2016 MacBook Pro , and you do n't have to deal with refurbished laptops . These are brand new . Sure , Apple released updated versions of its MacBook Pro line this year , but the MacBook Pro 2017 isn ’ t substantially different from last year ’ s model . What does that mean for shoppers ? It means they can save between $ 100 and $ 200 without sacrificing too much in terms of hardware . The models discounted on Amazon all include Intel Core i5 dual-core processors , Intel Iris Graphics , 8GB of RAM , a 2560x1600 Retina Display and solid-state storage . The exact CPU and CPU included depend on the model , as does the size of the SSD . There are three offers for MacBook Pros , all with Apple ’ s new signature Touch Bar : There are two lower-end models on sale as well . Both have 2.0GHz Intel Core i5 dual-core processors and Intel Iris Graphics 540 , and they come with 256GB SSDs . Neither features the Touch Bar . The listings don ’ t display any clear differences between the two other than model number . The first MacBook Pro is $ 100 off for a total of $ 1,299 , and the second MacBook Pro has the same discount and price . Each posting includes links and details on the newer 2017 MacBook Pro , but they don ’ t all link to the most comparable 2017 model , so some may appear to show a newer MacBook Pro that is cheaper than the 2016 model . If you ’ re looking for something a little bit on the cheaper side , there are also discounts available on a couple of refurbished MacBook Air models : An 11.6-inch MacBook Air is $ 659 , and a slightly large 13.3-inch MacBook Air is $ 679 .

The unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8 Plus is the best version of the top rated smartphone without carrier restrictions and now Amazon has it as a great price . It costs between $ 660 and $ 672 for the Galaxy S8 , depending on the color . The same goes for the new Amazon list price of the Galaxy S8 Plus now between $ 739 to $ 765 .

Lenovo has come up with a unique way to turn your humble house into a smart home with its new Home Assistant Pack . Unveiled during IFA 2017 , this `` pack '' consists of a speaker onto which you attach a Lenovo Tab 4 tablet . This creates a sort-of makeshift Amazon Echo Show , i.e . a speaker with a display . And would n't you know : the Home Assistant Back is backed by digital assistant Amazon Alexa , so it will provide verbal as well as visual information to users . The types of information you 'll see on tablet 's screen include weather updates , a look at your calendar and what music is being played . Like an Amazon Echo , the Home Assistant Pack speaker is voice activated . You can ask it to perform tasks , such as play music or turn on a connected device . The speaker base features two three-watt speakers , and it can detect your voice from up to three meters away with its double built-in mics , Lenovo said . It 's also light , weighting 300 grams , or just over half a pound , letting you take the speaker and dock from room-to-room as you like . If this all sounds appealing , there is a catch . The Home Assistant Pack only works when connected to a Tab 4 series tablet , a device we were pleasantly surprised by when we first encountered it in our hands on Lenovo Tab 4 review . As the tablet comes with either an 8- or 10-inch screen , your Home Assistant Pack has a little built-in customization . There 's also an optional Kid 's Pack , which turns the Tab 4 into a device for young ones , and a Productivity Pack that transforms the Tab 4 10 and Tab 4 10 Plus into a 2-in-1 for us older folk , according to Lenovo . The Home Assistant Pack starts at US $ 79.99 ( about £65 / AU $ 100 ) , with prices varying by country when it launches in October . By comparison , the Amazon Echo Show costs $ 230 ( about £180 / AU $ 290 ) , however it comes with the screen built-in . The Tab 4 itself is a great value , only costing $ 109 ( about £85 / AU $ 140 ) and $ 149 ( about £115 / AU $ 190 ) for the respective sizes . So , for a Tab 4 8 and Home Assistant Pack , you 'll spend $ 188.99 . Still less than the Echo Show .
For those of you who love the convenience of Alexa built into your speaker , but aren ’ t as much of a fan of the Amazon Echo Speaker , audio giant Harman Kardon may just hold a new 'Allure ' . The Harmon Kardon Allure boasts the manufacturer ’ s 360-degree sound , and has Amazon Alexa functionality baked in , negating the need for an Echo Dot ( currently the favored way to extend Alexa to a decent speaker ) . The Allure also brings ‘ ambient lighting ’ , which means it will glow pleasantly and react to both your voice commands and the music that you play through the speaker . “ We ’ re excited , to integrate with Amazon Alexa to deliver a beautiful speaker with astounding audio coupled with all the intelligent features of Alexa , ” said Harman 's Michael Mauser . “ Research shows the number one use of digital voice services is music streaming and Allure with its premium sound quality , iconic design , and exceptional voice-enabled technology , will produce a spectacular sound experience while delivering on our promise of elevating a connected life through smart technology . ” The speaker has built-in far-field voice recognition - necessary for anyone hoping for Alexa to work properly - standard wireless Bluetooth streaming and will retail for around $ 299/£250/AU $ 400 when it launches in ‘ Winter ’ 2017 .
Toshiba has announced it ’ s diving into the connected home with its new range of Alexa-enabled TVs . At this year ’ s IFA in Berlin , Toshiba revealed that it ’ s collaborated with Amazon for the new 4K Smart TV range which will make it possible to control your TV by speaking to an Echo or Echo Dot device . With the inclusion of the Alexa Smart Home API , these TVs will make it possible to perform simple actions such as turning your TV on and off , changing channels and inputs , adjusting volume and rewinding and fast-forwarding what you ’ re watching without the need for a remote control . To get your Toshiba Smart TV and Echo device in sync you simply have to connect to Alexa via the Alexa app once and keep both devices connected to your home WiFi . According to Toshiba , Alexa-integration will make watching TV “ a more inclusive and social affair ” as it ’ ll now be possible for everyone in the home to contribute to the TV schedule as long as they ’ re within earshot of Alexa . In some senses this is great , but we imagine democratisation of TV control will bring chaos to some homes more than others . We also find our existing Amazon Echo is frequently activated when it thinks it overhears our television as it is , so in theory there could be a risk of the television controlling itself . The Alexa-enabled TV models will offer Ultra HD 4K resolution but also come with a built-in upscaler feature which will mean that even if you ’ re watching non-4K content , its quality should be enhanced . It should , however , be fairly easy to find 4K content as the TVs ’ Smart Portal makes it possible to access the Netflix and YouTube apps which both have ever-growing libraries of 4K videos . As the TVs simply use Alexa 's API there 's nothing stopping Toshiba from building apps for other smart assistants in the future and when we spoke to a Toshiba rep at the show that seems to be the intention . According to the representative , Toshiba is looking to be completely 'agnostic ' as a platform and there will be more virtual assistant support to come . The range of TVs is expected to release in Q4 2017 with screen sizes ranging from 43 to 75 inches . Prices will start at 399 euros for the 43 inch model . No other pricing has been confirmed as yet but we 'll update as soon as it 's available .

Today , Google announced that it wants to make its virtual assistant more widely available by freeing it from the confines of smartphones , smartwatches and Google Home and rolling it into a wider range of third-party products . At CES earlier this year , we felt that we could n't turn a corner without seeing a product boasting Amazon Alexa support . Alexa was in everything from fridges to alarm clocks . At this year ’ s IFA in Berlin , however , it looks like it might be Google Assistant ’ s turn to be the star of the show . Not long from now , you ’ re going to start finding Google Assistant in third-party speakers , washing machines , vacuum cleaners and more . So , outside of Google Home what speakers will Google Assistant be coming to ? Perhaps the most noteworthy that was announced at IFA was probably Panasonic ’ s SC-GA10 . Due later this year , the speaker is being positioned against Apple ’ s HomePod in terms of prioritizing sound , but it ’ ll be fully fitted with Google Assistant support to ensure it has smarts too . If anything , it 's an interesting competitor to Google Home itself . You ’ ll also find Google Assistant in Anker ’ s Zolo Mojo and Mobovi ’ s TicHome Mini , but according to Google , this is “ just the start ” and even more speakers will be announced with Google Assistant support throughout IFA . While the speakers will appeal to a wide range of budgets , they ’ ll all be capable of the same Google Assistant functions such as web searching , schedule organising , smart home control and voice recognition . Not content to stay within the confines of speakers , Google will also be partnering with appliance manufacturers such as LG . Later this year Google Assistant support will be integrated into a range of washing machines , dryers , and vacuum cleaners so you ’ ll be able to control your kitchen via any Google Assistant equipped device , whether that ’ s a speaker or a smartphone . Google has said in its blog post that it will continue to update users throughout IFA on the different partnerships it ’ s making and where we can expect to see Google Assistant over the next year or so . It ’ s interesting , however , that this announcement has come around the same time Microsoft and Amazon announced they would be aligning their assistants , Cortana and Alexa , more closely . Whether or not Google is firmly setting itself up as a flexible digital assistant platform through these partnerships , or if it has any intention to work with other AI assistants , is unclear . We ’ re on the ground at this year ’ s IFA , so we ’ ll hopefully be able to bring you hands-on impressions of the new devices supporting Google Assistant and get some feedback from industry experts on how exactly they think the digital assistant market is going to evolve .
Though we have a choice of many digital assistants from a variety of companies that are capable of helping us do everything from turning on our favorite song to organizing our day , one thing they haven ’ t quite managed is to work together . It appears , however , that ’ s about to change thanks to a new partnership between Amazon and Microsoft . In a recent report , the New York Times has said that before the year is out , Amazon ’ s Alexa and Microsoft ’ s Cortana will be able to communicate with one another . So , for anyone using an Alexa device it ’ ll be possible to access Cortana by saying “ Alexa , open Cortana ” and vice versa for anyone using a Cortana-enabled device . It ’ s a basic level of integration which essentially just involves both companies creating skills on one another ’ s platforms , but it ’ s been something the New York Times says has been in the works for around a year . It ’ s also a somewhat surprising move - it ’ s not common to see companies as large as Microsoft and Amazon work together , particularly in an area as crowded and seemingly competitive as digital assistants . But it will have benefits to users . Cross-platform integration will mean Alexa users will now more easily be able to access Cortana ’ s Microsoft Office skills and Cortana will be able to fill the hole in its wider skills gap by allowing its users to call on Alexa . According to the New York Times , Amazon ’ s Jeff Bezos said that it ’ s important that users “ have access to as many of those AIs as possible ” as in the future it ’ s likely we ’ ll turn to different assistants for different things . For example , users will naturally turn to Cortana for anything relating to Microsoft ’ s Outlook or Office services . The most likely outcome ( and the outcome that ’ ll be most beneficial to users ) is that there ’ ll be a primary assistant capable to directing the user ’ s request to whichever assistant is most equipped to answer their request . Bezos stated that at the moment he hasn ’ t reached out to Google or Apple to see if they would be interested in a similar partnership but says that he would “ welcome it ” , while Microsoft ’ s Satya Nadella stated he hoped they would be “ inspired ” by the partnership . It is , perhaps , a different situation for Apple and Google given that their respective assistants Siri and Google Assistant are important parts of the very distinct iOS and Android smartphone ecosystems . Arguably these companies have more to gain from keeping their assistants separate . However , it could be beneficial for both users and Google and Apple to at least work more closely with Alexa and Cortana , if they can ’ t work with one another . More details of the partnership will be released later this week and we 'll report with more news as it comes in . Via The New York Times

Update : The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8 price gap is still wide , but the company is now throwing in a free Gear 360 camera with the Note 8 , as listed below . Amazon has one of the best deals on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus right now , as a number of other sellers have ended long-running sale prices . This summer has seen a lot of price cuts for the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus , with one of the best being $ 150 off , bringing the prices to $ 574 for a Galaxy S8 and $ 674 for a Galaxy S8 Plus . Samsung and Groupon offered this deal in the past , but recently stopped . Now Amazon has this deal going for the unlocked Midnight Black version of the 64GB Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus . And for the Galaxy S8 , that 's verging on half the price of a new Galaxy Note 8 , which starts at $ 929 , and some carriers are asking for $ 960 for the Note 8 price , like Verizon and Sprint . For anyone in the market for a new phone and dazzled by the Note 8 but crushed by its astronomical price tag , this Galaxy S8 deal is worth checking out . The differences between the Note 8 and Galaxy S8 are a lot smaller than the difference in price . Both run on the same Snapdragon 835 chipset , Samsung 's snazzy curved edge technology , an IP68 rating for water- and dust-resistance , and a 1440x2960 display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5 . The biggest things the Note 8 adds to the package are a second camera on the back , another half-inch to the screen , 2GB of extra RAM , and Samsung 's built-in S Pen stylus . The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are already great phones without a second camera , more RAM , and a stylus . For anyone that does n't absolutely need those , this deal is a more affordable way to get a top-of-the-line Samsung smartphone experience . Anyone who wants a little more out of the deal can throw in a Samsung Fast Charge wireless charging stand for $ 48 more . The stand has a list price $ 89 , so the savings add up even higher with this bundle . The $ 150 Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus price cut had been popping up regularly this summer , but is no longer listed on Samsung 's official site , so it might not be as easy to come across this kind of deal every day . This deal is being phased out elsewhere , and a better one might not come along until Black Friday or Cyber Monday .
If you thought the McGregor-v-Mayweather was going to be the best fight you ’ d see in 2017 , you might be sorely disappointed : Sonos and Amazon are preparing for an all-out brawl in the connected speaker space . The latest barrage of blows happened this morning when Amazon added multi-room audio support to the Alexa app , allowing you to group Amazon Echo devices together – a move that effectively copies Sonos ’ greatest strength . Grouping Amazon Echo devices will not only give you the ability to hear the same song in a different room but also also control the playback of the song from any Echo device in the house , creating a seamless whole-home audio solution not unlike the one Sonos already offers . The new feature comes just one day after the news leaked that Sonos is planning a voice-controlled speaker of its own , similar to the Amazon Echo , Google Home and Apple HomePod that , that according to new sources , will be unveiled during an October 4 event . OK , while I 'd like to tell you that you 're about to witness a re-creation The Battle of the Bastards by two of the most powerful tech companies in the world , it 'll probably be a bit closer to that game of espionage Littlefinger and Arya play in the middle of Season 7 : a lot of subversive plays to try and draw out what the other one is doing . To that end , both solutions have something the other one lacks . Sonos quite obviously desires the voice control functionality that Amazon Echo has , while Amazon wants the multi-room playback functionality that Sonos had . At first glance , it might appear that the battle is done and over . But there 's a caveat : The multi-room music feature is only available in three countries at the moment : the US , the UK and Germany . There 's also the minor limitation that synchronized music playback on Amazon Echo currently works for songs playing from Amazon Music , TuneIn , iHeartRadio and Pandora , with support for Spotify and SiriusXM coming soon . Sonos , for the record , can control playback for any of those streaming services and works in over 60 countries – but , for now , still lacks voice control . Which one will win a seat on the Iron Mantle of our homes ? Only time will tell .
Lots of action is happening around the Amazon Echo this week , and the latest development is a doozy : the flagship smart speaker is out of stock in the US . The Amazon Echo smart speaker in black is listed as `` currently unavailable '' on Amazon for the first time we ’ ve seen outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday . TechCrunch was first to make the spot . While it was available at our first check , the white Amazon Echo is out of stock now as well . A check of Amazon UK shows the Amazon Echo in stock in both colors , so this is n't a global pulling of the device . However , it raises a few questions . Namely , is an out-of-stock Amazon Echo a sign the online retail giant is preparing to launch the Amazon Echo 2 ? That ca n't be ruled out . Amazon has held a number of significant Amazon Echo sales in recent months , with the biggest a 50 % price reduction on Amazon Prime Day ( July 11 ) . Many , including your friends at TechRadar , saw this in particular as a means for Amazon to clear out inventory of the speaker to make way for the next-generation model . Then yesterday , as Amazon 's acquisition of Whole Foods was finalized , shoppers noticed Amazon Echo and Echo Dot speakers on sale in select supermarkets . The prices of the Echo and Echo Dot were reduced by $ 80 and $ 5 , respectively , in stores and online . This raised eyebrows as potentially another sign Amazon might be looking to get the Echo , which was released in 2015 , off of shelves . The Amazon Echo Dot is still in stock online . Now , Amazon may simply be facing significant demand for the Echo because of these price cuts , and it took Echo sales offline in order to catch up with orders . Or , Amazon could have an upgraded Echo 2 waiting in the wings . The possibly sleeker speaker is rumored to debut in the fall , or between September and December . With Apple HomePod launch scheduled for December , it 's likely Amazon will want to get a jump with any updated smart speaker it has planned . Via The Verge

Amazon now officially owns Whole Foods , and to mark the acquisition not only is the online retailer dropping prices on food items , it 's also selling its hardware at discounted prices in some stores . Shoppers have spotted Amazon Echo speakers on sale in select Whole Foods locations , as reported by TechCrunch . Right next to the produce , natch . Whole Foods is selling the flagship Amazon Echo and smaller Amazon Echo Dot for $ 99.99 and $ 45.99 , respectively . Those are $ 80 and $ 5 price drops , respectively , from the speakers ' everyday US prices . But Amazon Echo prices are n't just lower in brick-and-mortar Whole Foods locations ; Amazon has also reduced the speakers ' online prices to match . Mmm , nothing better than a farm fresh Amazon Echo at Whole Foods pic.twitter.com/loj5qHTucCAugust 28 , 2017 If it makes any difference , the speakers are marked as 'Farm Fresh . ' Ha . `` Farm fresh . '' Now you can buy Amazon Echo in the Whole Foods produce section pic.twitter.com/07R0znUn7tAugust 28 , 2017 The in-store signage also has a 'Whole Foods Market + Amazon ' logo on it , marking the companies ' merger and pointing to future benefits to come . These include giving Amazon Prime members special savings and other perks when they shop at Whole Foods , plus further price reductions for all shoppers . Amazon is giving customers a taste of what its tenure as Whole Foods owner will look like by putting its hardware in stores . What 's more , it 's likely selling off inventory in preparation of a rumored Amazon Echo 2 launch later this year . Whatever Amazon has up its sleeve , you can bet it 's not done putting the Amazon Echo front and center in its supermarkets . Not by a long shot .

Welcome to another crass collection of movies that you really should n't be watching this weekend . We are now into our 10th edition of Not On My Watch , which means there 's some 40 truly terrible movies you can now read about - just check out the gallery of the grotesque below to see what we 've been wasting our lives viewing over the last few months . Even though we have hit 40 films in our search for the worst film to stream of all time , the list of crap we could put in this feature is seemingly endless . That 's the thing about streaming services , while there 's many a brilliant thing on show , dig deeper and it becomes a bit like the opening scene of Blue Velvet . Below the white picket fence you 'll find beetles scurrying , shoddy CGI and nymphoid barbarians in dinosaur hell ... The Premise : A nymphoid barbarian finds herself in dinosaur hell , thanks to a world-changing event involving some terrible stop-motion animation . As titles go A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell is up there . It definitely got a click from me . But , and I hope I do n't come across as picky here , some things do n't exactly add up . For a start , there 's no such thing as a nymphoid . The filmmakers must have accidentally merged two words together ; in this case we 're guessing nymphomaniac and typhoid . Which instantly makes this movie sound less sexy . And there 's no dinosaurs in this movie . The awful stop-motion beings are weird mutant things - it 's even mentioned in the breathy voiceover at the beginning : `` They changed our pets and livestock into ghastly mutants '' . So do n't go trying to tug on our Jurassic Park memories and mention dinosaurs in your title , it 's just not on . It 's almost as if they made the movie - shock , horror - then gave it a title . Yes , this is a Troma production but even by their standards it 's pretty terrible . Kudos , though , for breaking up a near silent movie with an almost complete rendition of Lewis Carroll 's The Jabberwocky about 30 minutes into the film . It almost made us think we were watching something arty for a second - if it was n't sandwiched between a scene of some mutants scavenging on a beach and the titular barbarian catching some sun in a fur-lined bikini . The Premise : Warring factions try and take over a world that 's already been beaten up by four atomic holocausts and two ice ages . Just give the world a break guys , geez , it 's been through enough . If this is the future of the world , then stop this ride I want to get off . Shot on a shoestring budget and put through a filter that makes it look like a Mad Max movie colored in by a five year old , Future World : City Of Mass Destruction is as incoherent as it is unwatchable , as annoying as it is garish . It 's not actually a feature-length film but three 30-minute mini stories stitched together , creating a Frankenstein 's monster of a movie about a ravaged world that 's survived four atomic holocausts and two ice ages - making Future World the cinematic equivalent of a cockroach . The Premise : Two fratboys really want to impress a girl who is obsessed by ghosts so they pretend their house is haunted and accidentally summon the ghost of an Asian sex worker . I understand what the makers of Ghost Team One are trying to do here . Just as Scary Movie roundly mocked Scream , Ghost Team One has been made to take a couple of pot shots at Paranormal Activity . The funniest thing about this movie , however , is that Paramount actually gave it a small theatrical release . Ghost Team One is a mixed bag of dick jokes , scatalogical humour and weird racial slurs - ending in a conclusion that sees a fully grown white man pretend to be possessed by a Japanese sex worker . Yes , it 's as bad and as unfunny as it sounds . If you actually get to this bit , you 'll end up wishing that the found footage in this movie was lost forever . The Premise : Sinbad , of seven seas fame , is out to save a princess who has been taken captive by the evil Jafar . I should have seen this one coming , given the title has got the words 'sin ' and 'bad ' in it . Cannon movies has come up trumps again with this travesty of a film . The original Incredible Hulk , Louis Ferrigno - who had already been burned twice by the production company playing the muscle-bound Hercules in two awful movies about the Greek god - stars as Sinbad , a prince who must fight his way through a bevy of scenery chewers to save his princess . Ferrigno does his best in a film that sees him for the most part struggle with rubber props - including snakes and swords - and at one point inexplicably fight himself , which must be a metaphor for something but my brain 's too fried to figure it out right now . All while John Steiner as Jafar just shouts `` a-ha '' and dances around a bit . There 's also a scene where he 's stuck in an electric cage , which might the funniest scene featuring a cage since Nicolas Cage and the bees in The Wicker Man remake .

By now you 've probably heard mega online retailer Amazon is buying mega supermarket Whole Foods , and today Amazon announced the deal will make it through the checkout line on Monday . To mark the merger 's close and give shoppers a taste of what 's to come under new ownership , Amazon is also lowering prices on a number of Whole Foods ' best-selling items beginning Monday , with more price cuts on the way . Lower prices will go into effect for staples such as select organic apples , Whole Trade bananas , organic avocados , organic and responsibly farmed fish , organic baby kale and organic large brown eggs . If you 've ever shopped at Whole Foods you know just how expensive buying a few items can be , let alone doing a week 's worth of groceries for an entire family . You might as well sell your car . Jeff Wilke , CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer , said in a release the companies are determined to make `` healthy and organic food affordable for everyone . '' `` Everybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality - we will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market 's long-help commitment to the highest standards , '' he said . Additional lower prices will arrive over time as the two companies integrate their systems and logistics . But reasonably priced avocados are n't the only change afoot . Eventually , Amazon Prime members who shop at Whole Foods will get special savings and other perks in-store as well , Amazon said . Whole Foods private label products will also be sold through Amazon.com , AmazonFresh , Prime Pantry and Prime Now . And Amazon Lockers will be set up in select stores . Amazon is clearly ready to redefine Whole Foods as a more affordable health-food store , which is good for consumers but could have massive repercussions for other grocers . Stores that are n't backed by one of the wealthiest companies on the planet could struggle with the new lower prices , and some potentially could go out of business . Small businesses such as independent bookstores that could n't compete with Amazon met this fate ; now , smaller grocers could wither in Whole Foods ' shadow . Top image credit : Whole Foods Market

The smart speaker market is about to get one more contender as Samsung has confirmed it 's working on a device to rival Amazon Echo , Google Home , and the upcoming Apple HomePod . DJ Koh , president of Samsung 's mobile division , said in an interview with CNBC that the company behind the Samsung Galaxy S8 and newly announced Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is currently working on its own smart speaker . This news follows just over a month after multiple rumors claimed Samsung was working on a smart speaker powered by its digital assistant , Bixby , under the codename 'Vega . ' While Koh did n't provide a lot of details — for example , it 's not been confirmed if the device will actually be powered by Bixby , though it 's likely — he does mention the possibility of an announcement coming `` soon . '' However , with Amazon Echo and Google Home in a fierce arms race to one-up each other , and Apple 's Siri-powered HomePod arriving on store shelves this December , we hope the smart speaker market is n't too crowded in time for the supposed Vega 's launch — for Samsung 's sake .

Welcome to Not On My Watch , the only place to get your weekly fix of truly terrible movies that are streaming on Amazon and Netflix right now . As we are now onto our ninth edition , it felt right to do something to celebrate - and what better way than doing a whole article on freakin ' ninjas ? Ninjas , they 're cool right ? I mean , throw a ninja into a movie and it 's a recipe to print money . The thing is , ninjas were kind of dicks . They were the scrawny underclass of feudal japan , not perceived as being of a good enough ilk to be samurai , and turned to covert warfare to do their damage . Sure they looked awesome but their modern day equivalent is a teenage hoodie giving you a slap from behind and riding off on their stolen moped . That has n't stopped Hollywood and , more importantly , b-movie makers from liberally using ninjas in their oeuvre . And one actor who keeps cropping up in these movies is none other than Richard Harrison . Between 1986 and 1988 Harrison made 20 movies with ninja in the title . Yes , 20 . They include such gems as : Ninja Operation : Licensed to Terminate , Ninja Powerforce , The Ninja Showdown , Cobra Vs Ninja ... he is truly the granddaddy of Ninja-based shenanigans which is why three of the following movies are dedicated to him . If Harrison is the master , then Michael Dudikoff is his apprentice . He is the star of the American Ninja franchise . Our pick for the one you should n't ever watch - but kind of really should - is the second one , which has one of the most underwhelming taglines in movie history ... Enjoy/Endure - delete as appropriate . The Premise : Private Joe T Armstrong is a ninja , an American one , who has to confront a load of other ninjas on an army base in the Philippines . After the blinding success of American Ninja ( seriously , it made over $ 10 million which in b-movie land is big bucks ) its makers had something of a quandary . What do we call the second movie ? I mean , they could n't just call it American Ninja 2 , that would be too easy . They needed something bigger , a tagline that did n't just encapsulate the epic-ness of a movie about elite ninja assassins , but one that at the same time summed up exactly what was going on in the film . And with that , American Ninja 2 : The Confrontation was born . Nailed it . Many of the 'confrontations ' in American Ninja 2 take place on a beach , with the ninjas in question oiled up with sunscreen and wearing bermuda shorts . When they are n't sunning themselves the rest of the movie plays out like a buddy cop drama - but more like It 's Always Sunny In Philadelphia 's take on Lethal Weapon than Lethal Weapon . Also , for a movie set predominantly on an American airbase there 's a lot of ninjas about . They 're bloody everywhere , confronting people left , right and center . The Premise : Ninja master Harry is in search of a mystical statue that will give him superpowers so he can fight some ninjas and cut up watermelons . Well , I like terminators and I like ninjas - despite me ripping into them in the intro - so a film called Terminator Ninja seems ideal , I 'll just pop it on the old TV and 'oh , my god what the hell am I watching ? ! ' That was pretty much my reaction to watching Terminator Ninja , a movie that is hands-down one of the most bizarre things put to celluloid . It 's a bad movie , really bad , but it 's also strangely compelling . I do n't really know how to describe what is going on , so forgive the stream of conscience writing but here we go : Richard Harrison is Ninja master Harry ( obviously ) who trains for his fights by slicing up melons with samurai swords . He is the only person who can get back a golden ninja warrior statue that gives whoever owns it special powers . Instead of trying to find the statue , though , Ninja master Harry spends most of the movie cutting up watermelons ( he 's the original fruit ninja ) , wearing guyliner , and speaking to someone over increasingly over-the-top phones . Seriously , there 's one bit where he has a serious conversation with someone on a Garfield-shaped phone . Ninja master Harry is no ordinary ninja , either - instead of wearing all black , he wears a camouflage ninja robe , even though he never actual goes anywhere near any foliage to camouflage himself against . This means his camouflage ninja robe makes him stand out more . I rarely say this in Not On My Watch but please watch this film . It 's utterly , majestically bonkers . The Premise : Ninja Master Harry is no more ! Long live Ninja Master Gordon ! He stars in this ludicrous move about two rival gangs , the Furious Fox and the Black Eagle , looking to take over the world . Oh , dear . Where Ninja Terminator was actually good bad , this is bad bad . The Ninja Squad seems to have the only ninjas in the world that feel the need to wear day-glow shell suits instead of black robes . And if that 's not conspicuous enough they have headbands saying NINJA on them . Let that just sink in for a second . And that 's not the most ludicrous part of this movie . For a start , there 's not much fighting but a lot of prancing around and the fact this is almost certainly an old movie spliced together with some new footage shot in '80s America does n't do it any favors either . The Premise : Something about ninjas and gangsters , all wrapped in the worst dubbing ever committed to film . Ninja Dragon is yet again another cut-and-shut job of a movie . I 'm getting the feeling that even though Richard Harrison made over 20 ninja films over two years , the filmmakers actually only had him in a room for one day , gave him a load of costumes together and then said : 'do n't worry Richard , we 'll fix the rest in post ' . Ninja Master Gordon is back and this time he 's been spliced into a 1930s Chinese gangster movie . While everyone else wears nifty pinstripe suits he parades around either half naked or in his camouflage ninja robe last seen in Ninja Terminator . Hang on , is n't that end fight the same one that 's in Ninja Terminator ? I think it is . I do n't know what 's real anymore . Not even Ninja Master Gordon can save me now .

If releasing and updating smart home devices was a foot race , Amazon would be winning . It was the first to launch the Amazon Echo ahead of the Google Home , and the first one to offer both device-to-device calling and video conferencing via a camera on the brand-new Amazon Echo Show . But sometimes it ’ s not about coming in first – it ’ s about doing things better . Starting today , Google Home can now make calls not to another Home device , but to any number in the US and Canada – home phones , cell phones and business numbers – absolutely free . To activate the free calling service , all you need to do is ask Google to call someone listed in your Google Contacts with an associated phone number . Of course , if you ’ re unsure of a phone number , like , say for that pizza place down the street , simply ask Google Assistant to call a location specifically and it will locate a number for you . Saying “ Hey Google , call Dad ” automatically triggers a ringtone , a neat feature for the times you 're just a bit too pre-occupied to pick up the phone , but , perhaps even cooler is the fact that if your roommate or significant other walk in and make the same request , Google Assistant will know to call their father instead thanks to Google Assistant ’ s ability to identify voices . So , what does the person on the other end see when they receive a call from Google Home ? The way the system is setup right now , if you ’ re a Google Voice or Project Fi user , they ’ ll see your name and number . If you ’ re not , they ’ ll see it pop up as call from “ Unknown ” or “ No Caller ID ” . That will change soon , however , according to Google , who says that by the end of the year it will be possible for your own mobile number to be displayed . The easiest comparison to make here is to a home phone – the kind that have become somewhat of a relic in recent years thanks to the rise in cellphone use . Like home phones , Google Home is obviously tethered to the house , but unlike the unappreciated rotary dials of yesteryear , Google Home ’ s landline service is available for free without a monthly service fee . Ahead of launch , a representative from Google whitelisted our account , allowing us to place phone calls to friends and family before the service went live . The experience took a bit of front-loading ( i.e . making sure our Google Contacts were up-to-date with pertinent phone numbers ) but when finished , the service worked nearly flawlessly : Those we spoke to said that we can through loudly and clearly , perhaps not as clearly as we did while using a proper headset or a phone ’ s built-in microphone , but quite well considering our distance from the speaker . They said they heard themselves partially during the first few minutes of the call but later on couldn ’ t hear themselves – a likely sign that the built-in microphone is picking up some of the caller ’ s voice . Besides a few niggling performance issues , the only problem with the service is that , as of right now , Google Home only works as a line out . You can use it to make calls to friends and family , but not the other way around ... which is probably one of the reasons that you can ’ t use Google Home to call emergency services , as they ’ d have no way to call you back should you get disconnected . The fact that Home can only make calls and not receive them is a weakness that Google hasn ’ t necessarily addressed yet . But , considering that it ’ s making a brand-new hands-free voice calling service available to millions of customers at no cost , it ’ s hard to hold this minor oversight against the company for long . And , I mean , you have to save something for next year ’ s Google IO , right ?

Half the fun of ordering off Amazon is having your packages delivered straight to your door . However , the online retail giant 's newest service may be just enough to entice folks to head outside by having their goods ready to go almost instantly . Amazon is rolling out a new service called Instant Pickup , letting Amazon Prime customers in select areas gather their purchased items within mere minutes of placing an order . The idea is that certain 'impulse ' orders like snacks , a spare charger or school supplies can be ordered via the Amazon app and almost immediately be picked up at the established Instant Pickup location , helping Amazon insert itself into a whole new niche : last-minute shopping . While this sounds great for a variety of reasons , unfortunately , Instant Pickup is limited right now , with the grab-and-go system only in place for a small selection of items at two brick-and-mortar locations at the University of California at Berkeley and in Westwood , Los Angeles , home to UCLA . However , additional locations in Atlanta , Georgia , Columbus , Ohio and College Park , Maryland , are also being considered for Instant Pickup points , according to Reuters . This is n't the first time Amazon has brushed with blazing fast delivery . In the US , two-day shipping is a standard for the Amazon Prime members . Some applicable orders can even be completed in the same day , thanks to Amazon Prime Now . Certain orders made through AmazonFresh , Amazon 's grocery delivery service , can sometimes also be fulfilled in as little time as 15 minutes . As Amazon is expected to expand its reach to the food industry with meal preparation kits and ready-to-eat provisions , customers may be enticed further with the idea of not waiting all day for their packages — potentially giving Amazon a major new foothold as a convenience shopping giant .

The internet is a wonderful thing , sometimes . When 'researching ' this week 's Not On My Watch - essentially clicking on any movie that sounded either terrible , hilarious , or hilariously terrible - I thought it would be fun to see what people say about the movies I chose on title alone before I 'd actually watched them . It was a bit like having a palette cleanser before a big meal . I knew the movies would be awful , but it was good to understand the level of awful I was about to witness . It turns out , people do n't hold back . Take , for instance , Carnage : Legend of Quiltface , now streaming on Amazon Prime and reviewed below . Go to IMDb - which is also owned by Amazon , so these reviews are similar to pooing on your own doorstep - and it 's pretty clear that there 's not much love for this movie . Take Katatonia from Missouri who writes : `` A pre-schooler could do a better film . Avoid this like the plague ! '' Now , I know they are being subtle but I think I am getting the impression Quiltface was n't for them . Hottchopz from the United States has similar feelings , noting : `` Straight up . It is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen ... The only thing that sucks is that I threw it in the frigging dumpster right after I watched it . It was that bad . '' I am sensing a pattern here . But I 'll leave it to Lucky__Boy from Minneapolis to deliver the final note . Interestingly , it starts off positive : `` Perhaps this film is of some importance , as it should inspire anyone with a video camera to run to the desert to make a slasher flick ... '' Ooh , promising , do go on Lucky__Boy . `` Because they can not possibly do worse than this . '' Oh . `` Please do not think that I am saying this film is 'so bad it is good ' , but rather trying to emphasize that this film is 'so bad it is just plain bad ' . '' Double oh . And with that , here 's what I think about Quiltface and three other movies not fit for human consumption . The Premise : Dude in a quilt mask , with an obvious rubber machete and a penchant for silly dancing , starts killing people in the Nevada desert . There 's a bit in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre that 's truly terrifying . It 's when Leatherface goes full Leatherface after everyone escapes and he does this little dance with a chainsaw . It 's the dance of someone who has truly lost it . Quiltface does a similar dance in Carnage and it 's absolutely hilarious . He snorts and grunts and does a strange foxtrot after killing one of his many victims . Watch this ( it 's about 46 minutes in ) and discount the rest of this slurry of shoddy slasher nonsense . I mean , who calls their killer Quiltface ? Literally anything would be better . PenMouth , DoorknobEye , StairNeck - all better . ChairNose , BedHead , DuvetTeeth ... I could go on . Anything but Quiltface , it 's not the name of a serial killer , it 's a character in a detergent advert . Best watched when : You are after a duvet , you Google it and Quiltface comes up and you click on it and 'oh my god what the hell am I watching ? ' The Premise : Er , I think a spacecraft is found on Earth . Then someone goes to the moon . Moontrap Target Earth ... that 's a lot of words is n't it ? A lot of words that do n't actually make a whole lot of sense when put together . And that pretty much sums up this movie . It 's a mishmash of ideas that reach far beyond the budget allows them to . There 's a lovely space-infused dream at the beginning where it 's meant to look like a spaceship travelling through the vast reaches of the solar system but it ends up looking like someone throwing jelly at a wall . There 's also two robots in it , one which forces the only woman - Sam Butler , who is the only good thing about this mess - in the film to undress ( obviously ) . So , if pervy robots , bad CGI and some of the worst acting this side of Mars is for you then by all means watch MoonTarget Trap Earth ... EarthTrap Target Moon ... TrapTarget Earth Moon ... whatever this crap is called . Best watched when : In space , the only place where no one can hear you scream about how bad it is . The Premise : A group of people move into a house with a sinister past . The best thing about American Poltergeist is that the movie is a lean 80 minutes long and that 's with the credits . There 's really only 73 minutes you have to sit through . The bad thing is that those 73 minutes will feel like the longest 73 minutes of your life . That 's because there 's nothing redeeming in American Poltergeist . The filmmakers would have been better shooting a piece of paper with a long list of horror cliches on it - even that would have more substance than watching a group of people ( mostly women in skimpy clothes ) run around a big house and get scared by the sudden appearance of someone with old-woman makeup on . If you do stick it out to the end though , you get to hear a cop say the classic line : `` Your god ca n't save you now , kiddo . '' He 's right , not even god can save you from this nonsense . Best watched when : You 're possessed , head turned 360 degrees away from the TV and are shooting pea soup from your nostrils . The Premise : A baby-eating demon is let loose by a baby-holding woman after she purchases a butt-ugly figurine from a weird witch . Picture the scene : director Mark Jones is pitching his latest movie to a bunch of execs , possibly over mimosas and seafood in a posh LA haunt . He 's the director of none other than Leprechaun , a movie about a small murdering troll-like figure who goes on a rampage for a pot of gold . The movie has spawned a number of sequels , including Leprechaun 2 , Leprechaun 3 , Leprechaun 4 : In Space , Leprechaun in the Hood and Leprechaun : Back 2 tha Hood . Jones has created a money spinner and the execs are hanging off his every word , waiting for his new killer franchise idea . Jones , not wanting to be a one-trick pony , puts down his shrimp , takes a final sip on the fizzy orange stuff and pitches his new idea , fingers in the air like he 's holding the title . It 's a movie called Rumpelstiltskin , about a small murdering troll-like figure who goes on a rampage for ... a baby . Everyone smiles , hands are shaken , contracts are signed , and more shrimp is eaten . Rumpelstiltskin is a stupid movie . It 's not funny enough to be a comedy , not scary enough to be a horror . It 's the sort of movie that would n't look out of place in the '70s but it came out at the same time as Scream . It even tried to win me over by not having one but three homages to The Terminator movies . But then I looked at Rumpelstiltskin 's stupid rubber face and remembered I was watching something rather awful . Best watched when : You really want to see a vertically challenged Terminator chase a baby .

Not long after reports that Amazon filed trademarks for a meal-preparation service surfaced , it appears the online retail giant may have more food on its mind with a service involving an experimental method for prepackaged meals that come ready-to-eat . Using a technique called microwave assisted thermal sterilization ( MATS ) , Amazon is looking into selling already-cooked dishes that do n't require refrigeration , according to Reuters . Designed primarily for military use , MATS puts sealed food in pressurized containers of water that are then heated using microwaves for several minutes until cooked and sterile . These sealed packages can be stored on shelves for up to a year without refrigeration . The MATS technique could be especially advantageous for Amazon as it might save a hefty sum not paying for refrigerated transport and storage . This new service could also help it grab a bigger cut of the US grocery industry following its $ 13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods earlier this year . While the report claims that the company could be selling pre-made beef stew and veggie frittata packages as soon as next year , Amazon has yet to confirm either its home preparation kits or these ready-to-eat meals . Should these supposed plans come to fruition , however , anyone out there who hates cooking or doing dishes may want to consider re-upping their Amazon Prime account pronto .

Amazon may be the everything seller , but one item it does n't sell in the US is an event ticket . That , apparently , is something Amazon wants to change . The retail giant is in talks with venue owners to sell tickets directly to shoppers , according to four sources speaking with Reuters . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 Ticket sales in the US are dominated by Ticketmaster , but anyone who 's used the service knows hefty fees are tacked on , and the price of a ticket can double or more . Bringing Amazon into the mix would help venue owners sell more tickets , presumably because any additional fees would n't be as high . The upside for Amazon is that it could offer ticket promotions to Amazon Prime members , thus giving consumers more of an incentive to join . Amazon UK , by the way , already sells tickets to West End theater shows . Interestingly , Amazon is said to have held talks with Ticketmaster about possibly teaming up on ticket sales , but questions of which company would control customer data left discussions cold . Venue owners , too , want access to customer data , but this is one area Amazon is reportedly holding firm on . Whether this becomes an insurmountable hurdle for Amazon 's ticket ambitions remains to be seen . No timeline for when Amazon 's ticket ventures might begin was provided in today 's report . If Amazon does get into this side of the event business , it 's one more area of our lives it could easily take over .

Anker , an American accessories manufacturer , has been honing its “ anything you can do , I can do cheaper ” business model for years , but thus far has limited itself to things like Bluetooth speakers , headphones and portable charging packs with the occasional cell phone case thrown in . But its recent product announcement , a smart speaker with Alexa integration that looks ( and functions ) like an Amazon Echo Dot , might take the copycat cake . Anker ’ s Amazon-lookalike device is called the Eufy Genie . It ’ s a small , round device similar to the Amazon Echo Dot that comes with Alexa built-in but sounds better ( at least according to Anker ) and will cost even less than Amazon ’ s entry-level smart home device , coming in at just $ 35 ( around £26/AU $ 45 ) . Like the Echo Dot , the Eufy Genie ’ s Alexa is always listening , awaiting commands to control the music , check on the status of smart home appliances and ordering products from Amazon . The Genie will be available on Anker 's website starting on August 16 . What makes the Genie a good deal is the fact that it can connect to any device the Amazon Echo Dot can thanks to its built-in Alexa support . That list includes devices like the Amazon Fire TV , Ecobee4 Smart Thermostat , Samsung SmartThings Hub , Philips Hue Smart Bulbs and dozens more . The Genie has one trick up its sleeve that the standard Echo Dot does not , however , and that ’ s the ability to connect to other Eufy devices – Anker ’ s homebrew brand of smart devices . The list of Eufy devices isn ’ t extraordinarily lengthy , but on it you ’ ll find products like the Robovac 11 Vacuum Cleaner , BodySense Smart Scale , Humos Air Dehumidifier and , soon , a series of lights and smart outlets . While the Genie has that almost counterfeit “ me-too ” feeling about it , Anker ’ s intentions for the product are genuine : “ Everyone deserves the chance to live in their very own ‘ house of the future ’ ; where through one simple platform , they can order pizza , turn their lights on , and direct their robotic vacuum to clean , ” said Anker founder , Steven Yang in a statement to Digital Trends . “ What we are trying to do is to turn the smart home concept into something more affordable , accessible and integrated . With less than $ 600 , consumers can experience a Eufy smart home entirely controlled by Genie . ” An affordable future ? Sign us up .
Flashguns are one of the first accessories many photographers look to add to their kit , but decent ones do n't come cheap – a good entry-level flashgun from Canon or Nikon will set you back upwards of $ 200/£150 . But now Amazon is looking to undercut the big brands by selling its own dirt-cheap flashgun for under $ 28/£27 . It may not be laden with all the sophisticated features you see on pricier models , but the AmazonBasics Electronic Flash for DSLRs offers you a pretty risk-free way of dabbling in flash photography . There 's no TTL ( through-the-lens ) metering , which is hardly surprising for a flashgun this cheap , but you do get three flash modes ( Manual mode , Slave mode 1 , and Slave mode 2 ) , along with a standard PC sync port , as well as a built-in sensor that enables you to trigger the flashgun from a distance using another flashgun or your camera 's pop-up flash , for creative lighting effects . The head can also be tilted upwards 90 degrees and rotated 270 degrees for bouncing the flash off ceilings and walls , while it sports a pretty good guide number of 33 ( ISO100/1M ) . Guide number is a measurement of flash power , usually quoted in metres at ISO100 . Dividing the Gn by the aperture value gives the distance the light will reach and still Illuminate the subject sufficiently . You can choose from eight levels of flash brightness , and there 's an automatic save function that enables you to retain the current flash settings . Finally , there 's a hotshoe stand and carrying bag included . Not bad for $ 27.99 / £26.09 .

Welcome to the sixth ( SIXTH ? ! ) edition of Not On My Watch , the seedier side of TechRadar where we offer up four flaccid films for you to completely avoid . You see , for all the good streaming has brought to the world - a bigger and better Jeff Bezos for a start . Have you seen the guy lately ? He looks like he 's smuggling ballon animals under his t-shirt - it 's also opened the floodgates for some truly awful films . Movies you never knew existed until Amazon Prime and Netflix came along and slung them on the streaming scrapheap . That 's the thing with these streaming services , for all the amazing content they have , there 's a ton of things you would never ever want to watch . But , my word , are their titles enticing . Beast of Borneo ( with box art that sneakily makes it look like you are about to watch a movie called Beasts of Porneo ) , Swarm of The Snakehead , Slaughter Island , Vacuum Killer ( complete with tagline 'It will suck you dead ' ) , Ghost Shark 1 : Port Massacre , Ghost Shark 2 : Urban Jaws ... all of these are brilliant titles but terrible , terrible movies . And here 's four more awful films that need to be seen to be believed - the first being perhaps the most famous bad movie of all time ... The Premise : A family goes on vacation to Nilbog , a 'wonderful half-empty town ' . Except it 's not , it 's full of trolls ( not trolls ) , damn trolls ( definitely not trolls ) . I had so far resisted putting Troll 2 into this column as it 's , well , a bit too famous . But every time I seek out another bad movie , it 's there staring at me with its troll-like face . That 's right , I am being trolled by Troll 2 . Well , no more . You 've finally got your way ... this is why Troll 2 is one of the worst movies ever made . - It 's not even a frigging sequel to Troll , the 1986 movie . It has nothing in common with it . At all . Other than its name . So , it does have something in common with it . Damn you , stop trolling me Troll ! - There are no trolls in it . They are goblins . Crap looking goblins granted , but goblins nonetheless . The reason : the film was originally called Goblins . Damn you , stop trolling me Troll ! - One reason ( of many ) Trolls 2 sucks so bad , director Claudio Fragasso did n't speak much English while making a movie with an all English-speaking cast . Also , his wife ( Rossella Drudi ) did n't have much of a grasp of English when she wrote the script for the movie , in English . Despite the script reading - for some reason - like someone without much grasp of English wrote it , the actors were n't allowed to change any of the lines . Not even this cracker : `` I 'm the victim of a nocturnal rapture . I have to release my lowest instincts with a woman . '' Damn you , stop trolling me Troll ! - Finally , there 's a scene where Joshua , the boy who starts seeing the trolls/not trolls , pees on a table for no reason other than director Fragasso thought that would be a good addition to the movie . Damn you , stop trolling me Troll ! Troll 2 , it 's a must-watch , seen-to-be-believed movie . One that 's packed with the worst acting , costumes , set design , script , directing ... the worst everything . It did spawn a great documentary , though , called Best Worst Movie , directed by Troll 's very own Joshua , Michael Stephenson . Best watched when : Nope . I have nothing . The Premise : A father makes a robot dog for his son , after his real dog dies because that 's a completely normal thing you should do when someone goes through the grieving process . Let 's not beat around the bush here , the child in this movie kills his dog . It might be by some freak convoluted accent , but his dog dies because of him . He does n't deserve another dog , let alone a robot one . He needs to learn how to stop killing dogs , not be given one that are invincible . And that 's just the first 15 minutes of this awful kids ' movie . The rest of the film is essentially a dog killer doing doggy things with a robot dog that looks exactly like the dog he killed - except it can run super fast , talk and project home videos from his cold dead eyes . Best watched when : When you want to know exactly what not to do when your pet dies , especially if they died because of your own ineptitude . The Premise : Eve has some unanswered questions . With her parents dead and having grown up on the streets she wants to know just what the hell happened to her life . You 've got to hand it to the filmmakers of The Prophesy of Eve , they are so low rent they did n't even think to buy some audio equipment to make this movie with . It 's probably a good think , though , as it means you ca n't make out much of the hackneyed dialogue . At least the plot tries to be different : Eve was abandoned as a child because some supernatural being whisked her parents away without so much of a goodbye note . Eve grows up , learns how to fight and goes on a mission to find out why her parents died . This missions mostly consists of her wearing a sword on her back , her eyes occasionally glowing red and casting iMovie styled special effects from her hands . Best watched when : You mistakingly think this is the long-lost sequel to the Oscar-winning All About Eve . The Premise : There 's a virus doing the rounds and the only cure is in two vaccinations bottles , which are given to a bunch of kids as they have super powers . The world has been taken over by a virus that turns its victims from normal people into bad actors with rubbish prosthetic makeup , and the only thing that will save everything are three annoying kids who have special powers . Powers they never actually use because , well , budgetary reasons . There 's an amazing bit in E19 Virus , about 20 minutes in , when a mum tends to her sick daughter . It has all the makings of an Oscar-worthy scene , she 's patting her head telling her not to worry because her mum is looking after her , while her daughter ravaged by the virus just stares into the distance . The only thing stopping the Academy knocking on the door is the fact the makeup team have made her look like she 's wearing a pizza on her face , complete with stuffed crust . Best watched when : you have the sniffles and you really fancy a Pizza Hut ( other pizza companies are available ) . Watch the E-19 Virus trailer on Vimeo Marc Chacksfield is a former film journalist ( and TechRadar 's global managing editor ) who is already regretting agreeing to watch terrible movies for the sake of his column Not On My Watch .

Update : We 've received a statement from Blu on the matter . It reads as follows : `` Since Nov 2016 when the initial privacy concern was reported by Kryptowire , which BLU quickly remedied , Amazon has been aware of the Adups and other applications on our BLU devices which were deemed at the time by BLU , Amazon , and Kryptowire to pose no further security or privacy risk . `` Now almost a year later , the devices are still behaving in the same exact way , with standard and basic data collection that pose no security or privacy risk . There has been absolutely no new behavior or change in any of our devices to trigger any concern . We expect Amazon to understand this , and quickly reinstate our devices for sale . '' Amazon has removed Blu smartphones from its virtual shelves amid recent concerns that user data is being sent to third-party servers in China without the user ’ s consent . This comes after cybersecurity firm Kryptowire revealed its findings that many popular Blu smartphone models have been sneakily sending full text messages , telephone numbers of contacts and other private information . Following this , Blu issued a statement which refutes the recent claim . While it does state that a “ small fraction ” of its devices were found to be behaving in such a way last year , which TechRadar reported on , this is said to have been fixed . To give credence to Blu ’ s stance on the report , it stated that after these incidents , Blu switched off this functionality from Adups , the service that it and apparently , many other device manufacturers , use to send over the air ( OTA ) updates to phones . In addition , it switched from Adups to Google ’ s own over-the-air updates moving forward . Though , obviously , there still seems to be concern as to how these devices are handling user data . It ’ s an interesting turn of events that Blu is refuting a claim by the security company that it hired to make sure it was keeping to its word to put an end to Adups sneaking out user info . But wouldn ’ t Kryptowire know best ? After all , it was the one that discovered the privacy issue in the first place . Blu goes on by saying that there is nothing wrong with some information being stored in third-party servers in China . They are right in a sense , but only to an extent , as it doesn ’ t define exactly what constitutes as “ some information ” . Simple app usage data or full text messages ? All in all , it ’ s the phone makers ’ responsibility to ensure that user data is protected . And until Blu can provide the assurance that ’ s sorely needed from the consumer ’ s eye , Amazon ’ s removal of Blu phones seems to be warranted for the time being . Blu ’ s cheap smartphones , including the Blu R1 HD and Blu R1 Plus , have been on Amazon ’ s best-sellers page alongside . But there are other `` Prime Exclusive Phones '' like the Moto G5 Plus and Nokia 6 , so it ’ s in the best interest of Blu to make this right .
When a device is permanently listening to everything that ’ s happening in your home then you better be sure that it ’ s secure . However , researchers from MWR InfoSecurity have discovered a way to hack into the Amazon Echo , giving them the ability to install software that could allow them to listen to , and record , everything that the Echo hears – even if the speaker 's usual trigger word has not been activated . There are a couple of caveats to this hack . First is that it can ’ t be done remotely . This is a hack that requires direct access to the Amazon Echo speaker , where the potential hacker will need to remove the rubber base of the speaker to reveal its debug pads . The second caveat is that this hack is only possible on 2015 and 2016 versions of the full-size Echo device ( the Echo Dot is not affected ) . The copyright year on the packaging should tell you what year the device was manufactured in . The vulnerability doesn ’ t exist in the 2017 model of the speaker . However , with an estimated 10 million Alexa-equipped devices sold as of May 2017 , that 's potentially a lot of vulnerable devices on the market . There are a number of opportunities a hacker may have to compromise a device . When we spoke to MWR InfoSecurity they suggested that a hacker may intercept the speaker when it ’ s on its way to a customer , or else buy one , compromise it , and then sell it on as a second hand device to an unsuspecting consumer . Once the compromised device is in your home however there ’ s very little to let you know that it ’ s sending your voice data to anyone other than Amazon . It still responds as usual to voice commands , and its blue light gives no indication that it ’ s recording you at all times . Reassuringly since the device ’ s mute button is a physical switch , and a representative from MWR InfoSecurity confirmed that using it would prevent a hacker from listening in . Responding to the hack , Amazon commented , `` Customer trust is very important to us . To help ensure the latest safeguards are in place , as a general rule , we recommend customers purchase Amazon devices from Amazon or a trusted retailer and that they keep their software up-to-date . ” Since the hack relies upon getting physical access to the device , it shouldn ’ t be too difficult to minimise your risk of being affected . You can do so by making sure you only buy Amazon Echo devices that are new and directly sold by Amazon , and returning them if the box ’ s seal is broken . Buying the device second hand raises the risk of someone else having compromised it . You should n't have any issues buying a refurbished device from Amazon directly as when asked for comment the company assured us that its refurbished devices `` go through a very thorough process that includes wiping the device , a full factory reset , adding the latest firmware and all the appropriate testing . '' The Amazon Echo has already been the source of some security concerns . Last year it ’ s recording data was requested by police investigating a murder case . Amazon initially refused , citing customer privacy , but later consented after the defendant in the case consented to the data being used . However , even in this case the speaker would only have been recording after it heard its ‘ wake ’ word . This more recent hack allows the device to record constantly . The numerous caveats of the hack mean that it ’ s unlikely to become a widespread issue , but it should come as a potent reminder that if you ’ re putting a device with a microphone in it in your home that you should be extra careful about its security .

Amazon barely said a word about it amid this week 's Echo smart speaker announcements and squabbles with Google over YouTube videos , but there 's a new version of the company 's Android-based Fire OS headed to the Fire TV . The bulk of the details are relatively hidden in Amazon 's developer documentation , where the company announced Fire OS 6 will be based on Android 7.1.2 Nougat . Unfortunately , it looks as though you can only update to the new system if you have the third-generation Fire TV . As Amazon says on the developer page , `` At this time , the previous Fire TV devices will not uplevel to Fire OS 6 . '' That could mean a significant leap in features for Fire OS in general , as Fire OS 5 was based on Android 5.1 or 6.0 , depending on the device . The new OS brings Android TV features like picture-in-picture , which allows videos to keep playing in a small window while you browse other content . Third-party apps that support live video streams will also have access to time-shifting , which lets viewers pause and rewind live feeds . Fire TV owners will also get to take advantage of content recording , which allows multiple programs to be recorded at once . For that matter , they 'll also get to schedule recordings ahead of time , much as you would with DVR . Amazon already changed the overall look of Fire TV interface earlier this month , so you likely wo n't see much of a visual change when your update your device . As for Amazon Fire tablets ? It 's currently not clear if current models will get the updated OS as well , but Amazon should reveal that information in the near future .
Google is apparently working on a smart speaker with a screen on it , very similar to Amazon 's Echo Show . It already has an Echo competitor in Google Home , and it makes sense for it to introduce a device with a screen , especially when you factor in Amazon ’ s recent announcement of the Spot , a small device capable of displaying video , bringing Amazon ’ s screened offerings up to two . This is all unconfirmed at the moment , and comes from multiple unnamed sources feeding information to TechCrunch . One of the sources is apparently getting information directly from a Google employee . Apparently , the device ( codenamed Manhattan ) is going to be pretty similar to the Show in terms of screen size , at around 7 inches . Unlike the Show , Manhattan will run on Android , which Google is hoping will make it easier for developers to build apps for it . What ’ s interesting is that Google ’ s own app YouTube has recently stopped working on Amazon devices , although Google cited “ Amazon ’ s implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violates our terms of service , creating a broken user experience ” as its reasoning . As one of the major ways that people consume video media , YouTube is an essential platform for whichever smart screen has it . Amazon has its own Prime video service , and we ’ re sure that on top of YouTube Red , Google will be wanting to secure third-party apps like Netflix for the Manhattan too . Price and release date are currently unclear for the new device . Reports indicate that the original release date was planned to be mid-2018 , but due to Amazon ’ s releases , there is a push to try and release late 2017 . There is a Google event on October 4 for the new Pixel , and we ’ re hoping that Google will tell us a bit more at that event , but recent leaks suggest we 're more likely to see a Google Home Max and Google Home Mini .

Update : We 've spent some time with the Amazon Echo Spot , and you can read our early impressions in our in-depth First Look . So far , the Spot appears to be a fun , versatile , video-capable addition to the Echo family . See Spot run ! Sorry , not that kind of spot . Amazon has a new device , the Amazon Echo Spot , a tiny smart alarm clock/speaker with a screen . The Echo Spot was unveiled during a surprise press event in Seattle on September 27 . Think of Spot as a cross between an Amazon Echo Dot and an Amazon Echo Show . The Dot because of Spot 's compact size and audio capabilities , and the Show because of its display . Do n't let size fool you , however . The Spot comes loaded with features while maintaining a form factor that easily fits on a bed-side table or space-deprived counter top . Spot is basically a really advanced , voice-controlled alarm clock that lets you watch videos and make calls . Here 's everything you need to know about the Amazon Echo Spot , which will start arriving at customer doorsteps in December . The Amazon Echo Spot release date is December 19 in the US , according to the smart speaker 's Amazon listing page . Customers in the US can place an Echo Spot pre-order on Amazon right now . As for other regions , the Echo Spot will be available in the UK and Germany sometime in 2018 . There 's no word on when it may arrive in Australia , but considering the original Echo is n't on sale in the country , it 's doubtful Spot will arrive for some time . As for the price , the Amazon Echo Spot costs $ 129.99 in the US . That 's about £100 / AU $ 165 , though those are n't official prices for these regions . The Amazon Echo Spot is significantly more expensive than the Amazon Echo Dot , which costs $ 49 / £49 / about AU $ 109 , but then again , it has a display . The Amazon Echo Spot may be small but it packs a decent amount of tech in its 4.1 ” x 3.8 ” x 3.6 ” ( 104mm x 97mm x 81mm ) frame . These include a front-facing camera , a 1.4-inch built-in speaker , a 3.5mm stereo port , four microphones along the top , and various buttons to control the mics , camera and volume . The Spot display measures 2.5-inches across , and it 's here you 'll be able to watch video flash briefings , conduct video calls and see the feeds from smart cameras in your home . Like the Amazon Echo ( 2017 ) and Amazon Echo Plus , the Echo Spot features second-generation far-field voice recognition , allowing for better pick up when you 're speaking to Alexa at a distance . In spite of its small size , Amazon Echo Spot lets you do just about everything the Amazon Echo Dot and Amazon Echo Show can do . You can listen to audio books , ask for updates on the news and weather , check your to-do lists , watch video clips , listen to music and ask general questions . To conduct a video call , you just need to call anyone with another Echo Spot , an Echo Show or the Alexa app . Echo Spot also lets you make audio calls in addition to those by video . Audio-only calls to the US , Canada and Mexico are free on the Spot . The Echo Spot can play video clips from Amazon Video and other sources , and pump out the jams from the likes of Amazon Music , Spotify and Pandora over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth . Or , you can insert a cable into its audio output port to connect to an external speaker . You can also control your smart home devices with the Echo Spot , such as turning lights on or off , locking doors , adjusting thermostats and shutting off sprinklers . Echo Spot will also display live feeds from cameras in your home , such as baby monitors and front door cameras . While it 's not a smart camera on its own , Spot lets you see what the cameras are picking up . Just like the other members of the Echo family with Alexa support , Echo Spot has access to countless Alexa skills . These act as conduits through which you can connect with other services , such as Domino 's Pizza and Uber . With Alexa skills , you can ask your Spot to perform tasks with simple voice commands . Finally , Echo Spot lets you customize the alarms and the actual clock portion with different faces , because the Apple Watch ca n't have all the fun .

Amazon ’ s Echo Show — the Alexa-powered device that displays videos as well as spouting friendly banter — is now showing quite a bit less than it used to thanks to Google . Not so very long ago , you could watch YouTube ’ s entire library on the diminutive device , but if you try that today , you ’ ll get a terse statement from Alexa saying that , “ Google is not supporting YouTube on Echo Show . ” So , what gives ? There ’ s apparently a bit of a spat going on over Amazon ’ s use of the device and YouTube videos . In a statement Google sent us regarding the removal , the company said : “ We ’ ve been in negotiations with Amazon for a long time , working towards an agreement that provides great experiences for customers on both platforms . Amazon ’ s implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violates our terms of service , creating a broken user experience . We hope to be able to reach an agreement and resolve these issues soon . ” In a follow-up email message to TechRadar , Google said , “ YouTube notified Amazon about the Terms of Service violations well in advance . ” For its part , Amazon sent a statement dripping with disappointment to CNET on Tuesday : “ YouTube used to be available to our shared customers on Echo Show . As of this afternoon , Google has chosen to no longer make YouTube available on Echo Show , without explanation and without notification to customers . There is no technical reason for that decision , which is disappointing and hurts both of our customers . ” The wording here is trickier than it looks at first , as Amazon might actually be saying that the customers did n't get an explanation from Google . Amazon itself could be another matter . Google didn ’ t spell out what the violations are in its statement , but it ’ s possible they have something in common with its similar shutdown of Microsoft ’ s YouTube app for the Windows Phone in 2013 . Much like the original Windows Phone app , the Echo Show didn ’ t allow advertisements to be shown , cutting off a huge source of revenue for Google . And it may go beyond that , as the Echo Show ’ s elegant simplicity resulted in culling some of YouTube ’ s features , such as recommended videos , subscribed channels , comments , and sharing . That may not mean all hope is lost for Echo Show users , who likely picked up the Show expecting YouTube to be one of the chief uses for it . After all , it ’ s basically the modern spin on the kitchen TV . A few months after the Windows Phone debacle , Google finally released its own app for the admittedly neglected Windows Phone platform , allowing for uploads and , naturally , advertisements . Amazon Echo Show , by the way , is scheduled to come to the UK in November . It 's available for pre-order for £199.99 on Amazon UK now .
The new Amazon Fire TV is here , and it 's smaller and cheaper than ever . In fact , it looks more like a Google Chromecast than it does previous editions of the set-top box . Amazon announced the new streaming device during a secretive press event at its Seattle , Washington headquarters at which TechRadar was in attendance . It 'll cost just $ 69 or £69 when it launches later this year . That price will get you 4K , HDR video playback at 60 frames per second with Dolby Atmos audio , and an Amazon Alexa voice remote included in the box . Amazon has clearly managed to miniaturize its existing Fire TV set-top box so well that the need for a Fire TV Stick is all but nil at this point . The new Fire TV appears to be smaller than even the remote that 's included in the box . Inside , the new Fire TV uses 802.11ac Wi-Fi – or Ethernet via a microUSB adapter – to stream video at up to 2160p resolution at 60fps , all powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core processor paired with 2GB of RAM and 8GB of local storage . This latest device streams 4K HDR video using the latest HDR10 standard , naturally requiring compatible TVs to do so . Amazon has n't revealed who 's providing such a tiny powerful chip . The most recent model before today 's announcement is equipped with a MediaTek processor paired with an ARM Mali GPU , for reference . Finally , the new Fire TV will have access to Amazon 's Alexa digital assistant , not to mention the tens of thousands of Alex skills that have been developed in the past year or so . That means the Fire TV will be able to double as a smart camera hub , able to interact with and see through to a wide variety of Wi-Fi cameras from Arlo , Ring , Nest and Logitech . Luckily , all Fire TVs and second-generation Fire TV Sticks will gain this feature when it launches at an undisclosed time ( hopefully this year ) . The new Amazon Fire TV starts shipping on October 25 for $ 69 or £69 ( about AU $ 87 ) .
Amazon had one last surprise at its surprise event in Seattle today , and that 's the Amazon Echo Spot . Think of it as a cross between the Amazon Echo Dot and Amazon Echo Show . It 's tiny with a 2.5-inch screen that lets you watch live from a camera feed and video flash briefings , while also displaying information such as the weather and reminders to pick up your dry cleaning . The Spot is like a smart alarm clock with all the perks of a connected device with a display . It looks like it would fit nicely on a bed-side table or counter top . The Echo Spot has four mics along the top , and a line out so it can plug into any speaker . You can swap out the clock faces , which come in a fun variety . Connected to Alexa , you do n't have to physically interact with the Spot but rather utter commands to have it do your bidding . It features second-gen far-field tech , allowing for better pick up of your voice at a distance . You can also control smart home devices via the Spot , such as locking your doors , adjusting a thermostat or turning on sprinklers , making it a hub along the lines of the new Amazon Echo Plus . The Echo Spot also has the ability to do video calls , which is an awesome feature for such a minuscule device . During an event demo , the Spot was used to display a live feed from a nursery camera , so it acts as a smart cam feed for your home . It can also play video on its screen , such as clips from a late night talk show . The Amazon Echo Spot costs $ 129.99 and will ship in the US on December 19 . It heads to the UK and Germany in 2018 . You can pre-order the Echo Spot on Amazon now .
Amazon really loves buttons . First , it released the Amazon Dash button that allowed users to order previously purchased products in a matter of seconds . Now , Amazon is unveiling Echo Buttons , accessories for the Amazon Echo that can be customized by developers to add additional experiences to their apps . The example Amazon gave at its Amazon Echo 2017 event was that the small , hockey puck-shaped Buttons could be used as a buzzer in a new Trivial Pursuit app from Hasbro . While Buttons might at first be used as faux-game controllers for experiences , they ’ re certainly not relegated to only those apps – they 're versatile enough to be used in a number of other applications down the road . The Buttons will be available to purchase in sets of two for $ 19.99/£19.99 .
Amazon is supercharging its smart speaker lineup with the Amazon Echo Plus , a new Echo that also acts as a smart home hub . The new speaker will have hundreds of smart home partners available for it , letting you control smart lights , plugs and other devices right from the speaker . As a bonus , the Echo Plus will ship with a Philips Hue light bulb while supplies last . A simple command of `` Alexa , discover my devices '' will have the Echo Plus searching , identifying and connecting to compatible smart home products . Amazon says this set up process works with ZigBee devices from a number of manufacturers , including Philips Hue and Hive . There are also new color options for the Echo Plus : silver and white in addition to the standard black . Sound has been improved on the Plus , too , a good thing as audio quality was a big knock against the original Amazon Echo . The new speaker features enhanced 360-degree omni-directional audio and Dolby processing for deeper bass and sharper high notes . It connects to Amazon Music , Spotify , TuneIn and other services , Amazon says . Like the new Echo also unveiled today , the Plus ' far-field tech has been taken to the next level so Alexa is better able to hear you at a distance . All in all , the Echo Plus looks much the same as the first Echo , though it 's certainly bigger than the 2017 edition . The Amazon Echo Plus will cost $ 149.99 / £139.99 / €149.99 and is available for pre-order now . According to its Amazon page , the Echo Plus release date is October 31 .
Alexa , start your engines . The digital helper is headed to BMW and Mini cars in mid-2018 , Amazon announced at a surprise event in Seattle today . Amazon earlier unveiled the Echo 2017 smart speaker , an update to the popular Amazon Echo , which launched two years ago . With Alexa in the car , Amazon continues the spread of its virtual assistant , moving beyond smart speakers and the TV into vehicles . Alexa did have an earlier tie-in with Ford as well as a BMW Connected skill for Alexa-connected devices , but today 's announcement brings Alexa right into the wires of your BMW or Mini . From the car , you can do things like ask Alexa to turn on your outdoor lights , request directions , play music , call a business , order food , and check the news . The car 's heads up display will project information from Alexa , such as the music that 's playing , while voice commands let you ask Alexa just about anything ( that 's within its skill set ) . Amazon says that drivers will have access to thousands of Alexa skills through third-party developer integration . Alexa will arrive in all 2018 BMW and Mini cars starting in the middle of the year , and will be available in the US , UK and Germany . This is a major move for Amazon and Alexa , and we 'll likely see even more car partnerships down the road . Are you listening , Google Assistant and Siri ?
At an exclusive event in Seattle , Amazon has announced a brand-new Amazon Echo smart speaker . Revealed to a select bunch of technology journalists , with TechRadar in attendance , the speaker is a big update on the original Amazon Echo . It has a 2.5-inch woofer in it , a dedicated tweeter system and has been given a new decor with six shells available . There are even wood veneer ones . It is also smaller , too , which means that it 's not as expensive as the original Echo . The new Amazon Echo is available today for just $ 99 , £89 ( about AU $ 127 ) . Amazon is hoping that multiple Echo models will be bought by people , meaning that the Echo becomes a budget multi-room audio setup , which should have the likes of Sonos sweating . Amazon is also improving its Alexa API , so it will be easier for the speaker to talk to gadgets in certain rooms without actually having to say that room . So , if you want to turn off a light in the dining room and are in the dining room , only that light will turn off . This is a big thing for Alexa , as it makes the process of using the digital assistant easier . Amazon is also making it easier to group things , so in the morning you can have Alexa turn on the lights , your smart kettle , etc – all at once . Also available is Echo Connect , a speaker phone system that you just plug into your home . This is coming to homes in the US later this year , and early next year in the UK . Amazon also announced that Alexa will be integrated into BMW cars in 2018 . In addition to this , Amazon has created Amazon Buttons – codeable buttons that can be used to play games with the Amazon Echo . These buttons will be available later in the year for $ 19.99/£19.99 or about AU $ 25 .
TechRadar is in Seattle today for a big surprise Amazon event , where the tech giant is set to reveal a bevy of new devices . Just what they will be we do n't yet know , but our bets are on a big update to the Amazon Echo smart speaker and also upgrades to Fire TV and more . Amazon does n't usually do big events at its headquarters so what it has planned must be pretty significant for the company . In recent weeks there have been a trickle of rumors about new devices . The biggest of these was Amazon getting into the smart glasses arena . We 're not that convinced that we will see that sort of gadget today - it feels too early - but it does point to what Amazon is trying to do with Alexa , it 's smart voice assistant . It wants Alexa to be omnipresent in your life , available to call up at anytime . It 's likely we will see bigger integration with Alexa in some of its devices today , however . The most significant being Alexa in the Amazon Fire TV . Currently you have to use the remote to use Alexa , or link it up to an Echo device . It 's likely that it will be full embedded in the system and rumors are pointing to the ability to use Alexa for controlling your TV and any system you have connected to it . The biggest and most likely announcement will most likely be Amazon Echo 2 . It 's been a few years since the Echo was first launched in the US so it is primed for an update . With the Apple Homepod soon to arrive and Google Home now rivalling the system , we are expecting a big update here , including a completely redesigned chassis and a significant audio boost . The press conference starts in Seattle , 10:30am PDT / 6:30pm in the UK . Details will be on TechRadar as and when we have them .

Update : And just like that , the Apple TV 4K listing appears to have been pulled . Going to the previously active Amazon link takes you to a landing page that reads , `` Sorry we could n't find that page . '' There 's also a link to the Dogs of Amazon page , which we 're very OK with . Perhaps the switch was flipped too early for the Apple TV listing ahead of the Prime Video app release . Chances are , Amazon will reactivate the page before long . Or you can see who is selling the new box over on our Apple TV 4K deals page . Original story below ... No , your eyes are n't deceiving you . Today , an Apple TV 4K listing appeared on Amazon , marking the first time the online retailer has shown an Apple set-top box in two years . Though it 's currently listed as out of stock [ update : and now completely gone ] , Apple TV 4K 's status will likely switch to available soon . We only spotted an Apple TV 4K listing on Amazon US ; no such listing appeared on Amazon UK . Amazon infamously pulled the Apple TV off its virtual store shelves in 2015 , along with the Google Chromecast . Amazon , as you probably know , has its own TV hardware , namely the Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV Stick . Today 's re-listing is almost certainly related to the imminent launch of the Prime Video app on the Apple TV , which the iPhone maker announced would arrive on its device later this year . The Apple TV 4K went on sale this past Friday with a price of $ 179 / £179 / AU $ 249 for the 32GB version . Of note , Amazon listed the more expensive 64GB Apple TV 4K . No matter the reason for the Apple TV 's ( short ) return , this a major shift in Amazon and Apple relations . Will we see a similar thawing of the ice for Google , which , as Engadget points out , does n't have Prime Video app for its Chromecast line ? We doubt it .
Amazon has announced that its digital assistant Alexa is now available in the Amazon Music app on iOS and Android devices . At the moment the feature is only available in the UK , US , Germany and Austria . If you ’ re used to using Alexa on an Echo , or Echo Dot , it will be a slightly different experience , as you won ’ t have access to the full range of Skills ( Amazon ’ s name for its apps ) but will allow you to make more natural track selections . For example , if you wanted to hear a song but can ’ t remember the title , you can say “ Play the song that goes ‘ And I walked off you , And I walked off an old me ’ ’ and Alexa will play Maggie Rogers ’ Alaska . Or if you wanted to have a throwback hits party , you can say ‘ Play Justin Timberlake songs from the 2000s ’ and Alexa will line up a playlist full of tunes from his early solo work . Rather than using the ‘ Alexa ’ command to fire it up as you would on your at-home Alexa device , there will be an Alexa push-to-talk button in your Amazon Music app . Just give it a tap and make your request . Obviously , having a physical button takes away some of the draw of using a voice interface , but it ’ s interesting to see Amazon increasing mobile Alexa interfaces , considering the rumors that are doing the rounds about Echo Glasses that would tether to a mobile device . For now though , you can experience Alexa on your Amazon Music app by simply updating to the latest version of the app in either the App Store or the Google Play Store .

Earlier this month , Apple announced it would start pricing videos in 4K on iTunes at the same price as HD videos to celebrate the launch of the Apple TV 4K , and there was much rejoicing . Apparently , there was a lot of negotiating from competitors , too . Today , Amazon slashed the prices on all of its own 4K videos , making them infinitely more affordable than they were just hours ago . According to Pocket Lint , until recently you could find yourself paying as much as $ 30 for a 4K video from Amazon US . Now , though , you 'll find some of the titles for as low as $ 5 , while newer programs will cost you a little more . But only a little : you probably wo n't have to spend more than $ 20 . The catch ? Amazon still has a pitiful 4K selection compared to iTunes . The silver lining , though , is that some of those 4K videos will likely come free with a Prime membership when Amazon finally releases its expected app for the Apple TV 4K . For that matter , Amazon itself is expected to release a new Fire TV box with 4K and HDR support soon as sales of the old model have temporarily ceased and leaks of newer models are starting to pop up . The price slash is a seemingly small bit of news that could have a massive impact , as few things spur the adoption of new technology quite like making that technology affordable . With more accessible pricing , in other words , the 4K revolution is at last coming to the people . Via The Verge

Amazon ’ s wide ranging Kindle line has a model to suit all readers and budgets . At the moment its top-tier offering for the dedicated bookworm is the Kindle Oasis but that could change very soon . Stock of the Wi-Fi only Kindle Oasis has notably dried up on the UK store , with the product page stating that Amazon currently has no idea if or when the product will be back in stock . On the retailer ’ s US site , the Wi-Fi-enabled Oasis is still in stock , but its availability is limited , with Amazon stating that it ’ ll be able to ship devices in one to two months rather than immediately . The price of the Oasis has also notably risen in price on the US store , jumping up to $ 309.99 from its original ( already expensive ) $ 289.99 price point . Though it ’ s far from guaranteed and Amazon hasn ’ t announced any plans to change the Kindle lineup , this does suggest it could be gearing up to introduce a new Wi-Fi-only Kindle model . Particularly as the 3G-enabled model is still well stocked and sitting at its original price on the US store . Interestingly , earlier this year there was a leak ( no pun intended ) which suggested a waterproof Kindle could be on its way in the latter half of 2017 . Given that we 're now in the latter half of the year , the timing of this stock shortage is even more notable . An image posted to MobileRead , allegedly from a Chinese retailer , showed a Kindle with a waterproof glass display . The poster which accompanied the leak showed next to no changes other than waterproofing . Given that there didn ’ t appear be any technological improvements it would make sense for Amazon to phase out the expensive WiFi-only Kindle Oasis and replace it with a waterproof model . Not only would it prevent the dilution of the Kindle lineup , it would allow Amazon to appeal to the only section of the reading market it has yet to cater to – the bathtime reader . Considering the high price point of the Kindle Oasis we wouldn ’ t be averse to seeing it replaced with a model that boasts such a useful upgrade .

Echo glasses could soon be on their way . Amazon is reportedly working on a pair of spectacles that carry its digital assistant , so you can have a Alexa with you wherever you go . The spectacles will apparently work using bone conduction technology , which transfers sound to your inner ear using vibration on the points of contact between the device and your skull . The benefit of bone conduction is that it doesn ’ t require blocking or covering your ears so still allows you to have unimpeded hearing of your surroundings . Interestingly , the glasses are reported to not have any visual element like a screen or camera . As Alexa is primarily a vocal interface , it ’ s not a massive surprise , but it does mean that the Alexa glasses will lack the full functionality that augmented reality glasses promise . Given that there were a number of Echo models that came out before the Echo Show with its visual element , there is the possibility that Amazon will follow the same model with the glasses , building on the success of a simpler model first . The glasses will reportedly not be an entirely standalone device , but will work by tethering to a smartphone . All of these streamlining features should mean that the glasses have very long battery life . At the moment , the Alexa Glasses are unconfirmed by Amazon , we only know about this due to a Financial Times report . Lending credence to the rumors is the fact that Google Glass founder Babak Parviz was hired by Amazon in 2014 , so it was surely only a matter of time before we saw something you could wear on your face from them . The spectacles are apparently going to be available by the end of the year , and if they do , we imagine they are going to be gracing many people ’ s Christmas lists . Via Engadget

Amazon has refreshed its Fire HD 10 tablet with a few improvements and a price drop that may make it one of the best cheap tablets you can buy this year . The new Fire HD 10 has a 10.1-inch Full HD display , which is the first time an Amazon tablet has sported a 1080p resolution and should make media a lot more enjoyable to watch . There are dual stereo speakers that allow for Dolby Atmos audio , which should offer much better audio when watching videos on the tablet . This is also the first tablet from Amazon to come with far-field Alexa technology , meaning you can summon the voice assistant without having to press a button . There 's also a new software section called 'For You ' that should recommend books , video and music depending on your previous usage of Amazon services like Instant Video or the Kindle store . Amazon ’ s Fire HD 10 also now comes with either 32GB or 64GB of storage as standard so you wo n't be limited to 16GB on board , but there ’ s microSD support of up to 256GB if you 're tempted to pack it full of media . Another highlight of the tablet is a price drop though . Amazon has brought the price down lower than on the previous version of the slate , making it only £149.99 or $ 149.99 for the 32GB version . Considering the last Fire HD 10 cost £169.99 / $ 229.99 for the 16GB model , Amazon has really managed to drop the price here . Amazon is n't releasing the new tablet in Australia .

Apple may have been quiet about tablets this week , but Amazon is n't doing likewise . The new Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 tablets from Amazon are a pair of incredibly affordable tablets that are n't half bad , especially the Fire HD 8 , and Amazon is currently giving Prime members a discount of over 30 % on each . Jump straight to the deals : The Fire 7 is a no-frills tablet with a 7-inch display at a resolution of 1,024x600 pixels . The screen and camera are no killers , but the tablet comes with dual-band wi-fi for good connectivity , and it features one of Amazon 's most popular recent creations : Alexa . At $ 50 for the 8GB model with Amazon special offers displayed on the lockscreen , the Fire 7 is a super low-budget tablet with a smart assistant thrown on top . At that price , it 's already one of the cheapest ways to get an Alexa-enabled device . But Prime members can get the Fire 7 for $ 15 off , making it an incredibly cheap $ 35 . The Fire HD 8 may be $ 30 more than the Fire 8 at their base prices , but it has more to offer . On top of a slightly bigger screen with a resolution of 1,280x800 , the Fire HD 8 also has double the storage of the Fire 7 . It also has Alexa baked in . The Fire HD 8 starts at $ 89 , which makes it a good buy , but with Amazon 's $ 25 discount for Prime members , the Fire HD 8 is just $ 64 right now . There are plenty of other tablets with higher specs and bigger screens , but it 's hard to beat the value of the Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 when a deal like this is going .

The old adage is true : When it rains , it pours . Not only is there a very good chance that we ’ ll see a Apple 4K TV at tomorrow ’ s iPhone 8 keynote but , to add icing to the cake , Amazon ’ s next two Fire TV devices were leaked earlier today by AFTVNews . The information in the report specifies two new models : a Chromecast-esque streaming dongle that will hang off the back of the TV , and a square version of the Amazon Fire TV that will come with a powerful microphone built right into it . Both devices will support 4K HDR at 60 frames per second . The streaming dongle iteration of the Amazon Fire TV will sit in between the Amazon Fire TV Stick and standard Amazon Fire TV , and likely hover around the $ 60-80 ( £40-70 ) price point . The larger , cube-shaped Amazon Fire TV is likely to be the new flagship model , and will heavily rely on Alexa , Amazon ’ s smart assistant . According to documents obtained by AFTVNews , the cube will come with a built-in microphone and glowing LED , similar to the ones found in the Amazon Echo and Amazon Echo Dot , that will allow you to speak directly to Alexa without holding a remote . Beyond the far-field microphone and LED bar , the larger Amazon Fire TV device will also have an IR emitter that will allow it to work with older TVs that don ’ t support the HDMI-CEC standard . Neither device has been officially confirmed by Amazon at this point but , given the substantial proof AFTVNews has in hand , it seems inevitable at this point that Amazon will do so soon . Any other day , and the two new Amazon Fire TV devices would consume the entire industry ’ s attention – any other day except the day before a big Apple event , that is . Apple ’ s event on September 12 is reportedly the place we ’ ll see the 4K Apple TV for the first time . It ’ s something Apple spent some time gearing up for , and tomorrow we might finally see the fruits of that labor . With two new Amazon devices and a new Apple TV en route , it ’ s only a matter of time before we have another all-out streaming box battle .

When it comes to must-see TV , most of us would probably think of HBO or Netflix before Amazon - and that 's a situation that Amazon and Blue Origin chief Jeff Bezos is keen to start changing , according to a weekend report in industry outlet Variety . In short , Bezos wants the next Game of Thrones-style super smash hit TV series to appear on an Amazon network rather than one owned by a rival company , and he 's instructed his team of executives to start shifting their strategy to finding a small-screen success . Amazon Studios is now looking for `` high-end drama series with global appeal '' , according to Variety , TV shows that are going to set social media buzzing and which will also translate well to international markets outside of the US and UK . `` It 's pretty evident that it takes big shows to move the needle , '' Amazon Studios boss Roy Price told Variety , citing internal company data on viewer behavior and praising the most well-known fantasy epic of recent times . `` I do think Game of Thrones is to TV as Jaws and Star Wars was to the movies of the 1970s . '' Amazon is looking to build on successes like The Man in the High Castle and The Grand Tour with programming that covers sci-fi , fantasy , crime and more , according to Price . Other shows have been cut to make room as Amazon looks for a big hit . Pilots recently greenlit include a crime drama focusing on the battle between Chinese gangs for control of the San Francisco underworld in the late 1800s , and an unnamed comic book adaptation being produced by Seth Rogen . Amazon says details on all its new shows will be revealed soon - and maybe there 'll be a Game of Thrones hit among them . Via Digital Trends

One of the most iconic film series ever , James Bond has always been a hotly contested property for movie studios , TV producers and , now , two newcomers . Apple and Amazon are reportedly throwing bids in for the rights to the world-famous secret agent , according to sources of The Hollywood Reporter . This comes shortly after the current film deal between the rights holders , MGM and Eon , ran out with distributor Sony following the release of 2015 's Spectre . This leaves the 25th James Bond film , starring Daniel Craig and planned for a 2019 release , without a company to co-produce and distribute the film — leaving on the table not just a potential blockbuster but an important milestone in the top-grossing franchise . Apple and Amazon are n't the only ones eyeing Bond , of course , as the usual big names in Hollywood like Warner Bros. , 21st Century Fox , Universal , and Sony are also clamoring for a shot at 007 . As for what Amazon or Apple could possibly do with the Bond brand , the report claims that the espionage franchise — estimated to be worth anywhere between $ 2 billion and $ 5 billion — has a lot of untapped potential outside of movies . Under the management of either tech giant , the Bond name could be licensed out to a wider range of products and projects , akin to Disney 's initiatives following its purchase of Marvel in 2009 and Star Wars in 2012 . A 007 television series , for example , could easily propel Amazon or Apple 's video services , given Amazon 's penchant for original programs courtesy of Amazon Prime Video and Apple reportedly getting into original shows for itself . It 's unclear if the companies ' suspected bids are just for distribution rights of the 25th Bond film , or for the entire franchise outright . Should the latter be true , scoring exclusivity on 55 years of Bond filmography would be a nice feather in the cap for either one . As for the 2019 Bond film , the future remains up to the highest bidder . While it looks like Warner Bros. is reportedly in the lead to snag the deal , the studio may have stiff competition — Amazon and Apple do n't exactly have shallow pockets . Top Image Credit : 007.com

Planning on picking up an Xbox One X ? You 'll be happy to know that it will support 4K streaming through the Amazon Prime Video app when it launches on November 7 . Nor will this feature be limited to US Xbox users . As of today , the Amazon Prime Video app is available globally on Xbox One . In the words of Microsoft 's announcement on Xbox Wire , this is true from `` Australia to Canada and even Bhutan to Uzbekistan . '' It 's another big move in Amazon 's continuing battle with Netflix , which has already managed to extend its availability to almost every country in the world . Amazon followed soon after in December of last year , bringing its young streaming service to more than 200 countries . Up until now , you could only access that service on the Xbox in a few countries , but now Xbox users in countries like Canada , Mexico , France , Italy , Spain and India can enjoy it as well . That 's especially appealing now , as Amazon has managed to produce an impressive line of critically acclaimed shows such as The Man in the High Castle , Transparent , Mozart in the Jungle , American Gods , The Tick and more . You 'll also be able to watch 4K video with the app if you own the Xbox One S , but unfortunately the original Xbox One wo n't be able to handle it .

Good news if you 've got one of the basic Kindle ereaders , the cheapest $ 80 or £60 model - based on an updated listing for the product on Amazon 's site , support for Audible audiobooks is going to be added in the `` coming months '' ( though at the moment this only shows up on the US site ) . That will put the device on a par with the brand new Kindle Oasis , enabling you to listen to audiobooks straight from the ereaders themselves , and even switch between the text and audio versions of titles if you own both . As with the Oasis , you 'll need Bluetooth speakers or headphones to listen in , because the Kindles do n't have a 3.5mm headphone jack or built-in speakers . As long as you 've got some kind of wireless listening kit up and running , you 'll be good to go . Apparently the upgraded capabilities will be arriving as an over-the-air update in the near future , but so far there 's no word on whether the middle Kindle models - the Paperwhite and the Voyage - are going to get the same treatment . At the time of the Oasis announcement , Amazon did hint at some sort of upgrade for the older models , but now it 's in black and white on the Amazon site . Those of you with long memories might recall that the very first Kindle back in 2007 had support for Audible audiobooks , before the feature ( and integrated audio support ) got ditched . While `` coming months '' is a little vague from Amazon , it 's good to know the feature is on the way - and it might make a difference to your shopping plans as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday .

The LG G6 and other perfectly fine LG phones mostly suffer from the fact that today 's best phones list is stacked by Samsung , Google and Apple . It 's hard to get noticed , so today LG announced it 's bringing in a colossal reinforcement : Amazon . The two will start selling four of LG 's smartphones in November through the ever-popular Amazon Prime service and offer deep discounts on each phone in the US . It 'll work like other Amazon Prime Exclusive phones by manufacturers like Motorola , Alcatel , Nokia and Blu . Phones will be unlocked and see a significant price drop . In exchange , `` personalized ads '' will display on the lockscreen . While the Amazon Prime Exclusive phones program is n't available outside of the US at the moment ( Amazon already offers many UK 's SIM-free phones ) , it could have global implications on how LG sells its phones worldwide . It also offers an alternate path for LG to escape Samsung and Apple 's shadow – just a little bit . US carrier have purposefully complicated device payment plans . Amazon Prime , on the other hand , offers a straightforward way to purchase a smartphone – without paying full price and with free two-day shipping . This could be a game changer for both LG and Amazon . LG is the most widely known phone maker among the budding Prime Exclusive phones list . That 's great for Amazon . And everyone loves ordering from Amazon , even if its ideas are creepy sometimes . That 's great for LG . What 's in it for you ? Well , the price drop for being forced to glance at Amazon deals on your lockscreen is tremendous . You 'll going from paying $ 672 for an LG G6 from Verizon to doling out just $ 399 on Amazon . That payoff is worth it for people looking for solid phone deals in the US . Here are LG 's four Amazon Prime phones ( coming in for November ) Saving as much as $ 273 on a smartphone does come with one string attached : There 's no way to make monthly device payments like US carriers do . Amazon has n't gotten into the phone financing game . You 'll save a heap on the full price of the phone , but it is n't broken down over 24 months like a lot of people are used to . It 's simply a money saver in the long run . That said , you can get more money for selling your phone through Amazon than any US carrier will offer you via a trade-in program . Those tend to be a rip-off . It seems like win , win , win news for LG , Amazon and consumers – especially if it forces carriers to quit using complicated and expensive phone contracts . The LG V30 is n't part of the Amazon Prime Phone program just yet , so we 've reached out to LG and Amazon to find out if it 's in the offing ( after what we suspect is a carrier-exclusive time period ) . We 'll update this story when we hear back .

Up until now , there 's never been a need to pay for the extra services or `` skills '' you can get for Amazon 's Alexa voice assistant on Echo devices , but that 's no longer the case . That 's because Alexa now has a monetization model . It 's a move that seems geared toward letting third-party skill developers get some cash back for their efforts and so possibly encourage other developers to start making skills for the platform . As Voicebot.ai discovered while using the Amazon Echo Show , the popular Jeopardy ! skill is the first to enjoy the new monetization model . In exchange for $ 1.99 ( about £1.50 / AU $ 2.60 ) per month , Echo users will get six extra questions ( or `` clues , '' in the game 's parlance ) per day while playing with Alexa . Amazon tells us the Jeopardy subscription model is US-only , for now . The Jeopardy skill is a particularly good one for Amazon to test the service , as it 's found on every Echo device from the affordable and lightweight Amazon Echo Dot to the pricey Show . ( It 's particularly entertaining on the Show , which presents questions as white text on a blue screen , much as you 'd see while watching the actual program on television . ) The payment model is n't as predatory as it possibly sounds . Most notably , you only have to pay for the extra questions if you 're not an Amazon Prime member , and if you own any kind of Amazon Echo device , there 's a good chance you 're already a Prime member anyway . The new subscription also does n't fundamentally change the way the skill works . Before , you only got access to six questions per day , but the `` Double Jeopardy '' subscription model brings that number up to 12 . It 's worth contemplating , though , how popular the developers will find the option when Amazon eventually rolls it out further , considering how common Amazon Prime subscriptions are . One possible answer is that Amazon may simply maintain its existing rewards program for Alexa skills , in which it simply flat-out pays developers for making `` eligible skills that customers engage with most . '' The catch is that the system appears to be highly subjective , with the main criterion for qualification being described like so : `` If your Alexa skill qualifies , you will receive an email from the Alexa team by the middle of the following month . '' Well , that 's ... precise . In that context , knowing straight off that you 're going to get $ 1.99 from each new customer who uses the skill seems like a far more appealing bet . But will Alexa lose some of her appeal in the process ?
Never doubt Amazon ’ s prowess when it comes to innovation . This is the company that turned an online book store into one of the largest companies in the world in a decade , and now sells everything under the sun at cheaper prices than outlet stores . But sometimes the company ’ s ‘ innovation ’ can be a little… divisive . Take , for example , Amazon Key , a new high-tech package delivery system that 's being rolled out in the US , which allows mail couriers to enter your home to drop off deliveries rather than leaving them on the porch where strangers can snag them before you ever get home . In order to achieve this level of white-glove service , Amazon has to take a few liberties with your personal space . You ’ ll need to install Amazon ’ s Cloud Cam near your door , and sync your smart home up with an Amazon Key-compatible smart lock . Amazon can then grant its delivery drivers access to your home remotely , and send you a live feed of the delivery as it ’ s happening . If you can get over the idea of an Amazon delivery person temporarily stepping into your home , Amazon Key promises to be the bane of the front porch package thieves , and good news for the rest of us . So how much is Amazon ’ s futuristic delivery service going to cost you ? Once you buy all the components , absolutely nothing . But buying those components – the Amazon Cloud Cam and Amazon Key-compatible smart lock – could be a bit pricey . Right now , Amazon is offering Amazon Prime subscribers a deal that for $ 249 gives you a smart lock , a connected camera and free installation . Should you already own a smart lock from Yale or Qwikset , you can buy a Amazon Cloud Cam separately for $ 120 . Once set up the basic system won ’ t cost anything to maintain , but should you want to be able to see more than the last 24 hours worth of clips , there are three additional subscription packages you can choose from : The Amazon Cloud Cam is available to pre-order today , and should ship by the time Amazon ’ s in-home delivery system gets up and running on November 8 . For starters , you 'll need to be an Amazon Prime subscriber , as Amazon is only opening this up to its most loyal fanbase first . If you 're not already an Amazon Prime subscriber , you can sign up via this link . Here ’ s the cool part : Once you 've signed up for Amazon Prime and your system is up and running with camera installed and lock on the door , Amazon will enable a Key delivery option automatically at checkout . But before you get any big ideas of ordering a washer from Amazon to watch in horrifying glee as a delivery as a delivery person struggles to carry it up the two flights of stairs to your apartment , there are two major caveats . The first is that Amazon will only allow Amazon Key delivery for around 10 million goods on the website - and only on stuff that a delivery person could reasonably carry by themselves . Which means for now , appliances and large electronics are not included in the service . The other caveat is that while Amazon is an innovator , it ’ s not an idiot - Amazon is only enabling Amazon Key deliveries for its own drivers . That means it won ’ t open this service to UPS , FedEx or even the USPS - at least for now . While that may help you sleep easier at night knowing it ’ s only Amazon who has a key to your home , it ’ s also problematic for anyone living outside of the 37 cities where Amazon actually handles its own deliveries . Live outside of those 37 US cities and it could be awhile before you get access to Amazon Key . Of course , Amazon was n't just thinking about deliveries when it designed the Amazon Key system : it will soon be available to professional services as well . What that means is , say , you want to schedule a dog walker but ca n't be there to let him or her into the house every day . You could use your Amazon Key setup to grand that person access to your home for short periods of time . If you 're not a pet owner , it 's OK - Amazon is planning on opening up the service to the 1,200 companies that are part of Amazon 's Home Services program . That list includes maid services , pet sitters , repair people and more . Like any other smart lock , you can also send key codes to friends and family members , too , allowing them to come and go from the house without you being there to let them in or see them out . Pretty nifty ! So how exactly will the system work ? As mentioned , once your system is setup you ’ ll be able to check Amazon Key delivery at checkout . A driver will come to your place as per usual , but instead of leaving the package on your doorstep , the delivery driver can scan the barcode on the side of the package to match it up to your order number . Should everything come back OK , your smart lock will click open and the camera inside the house will turn on and start recording the drop-off . You ’ ll get a notification on your phone that a delivery is being made , and Amazon will store a copy of the video for 24 hours so you can view it later . The delivery person will place the package close to the entryway of the home and once the delivery is complete , the smart lock will relock as the delivery person exits your home . Now , it 's worth pointing out that Amazon Key is n't compatible with other security systems you already have in your home . So , if you have an alarm in the house that needs to be disarmed when someone enters the house , you 'll need to turn that off on the day the delivery is slated to happen . The system seems pretty safe , right ? For all intents and purposes it is . And yet in a world full of stolen credit card information and password leaks , it can be scary to put the literal keys to your front door in the hands of a big company . And this is Amazon ’ s biggest obstacle in widespread adoption to Key - people just aren ’ t all that trusting of big companies at the moment . To play devil 's advocate , the idea is relatively well thought-out . The ability to unlock your door is only being granted to Amazon delivery drivers , and only if they are currently carrying a package that ’ s slated for delivery to your house that day . If they come later with a different package , there ’ s no way to get in . Then there ’ s the camera to consider . Any time someone does use the app , the camera will start up and start recording - sending you a real-time feed of the delivery in progress . There ’ s no Amazon password information being exchanged between you and the driver , and the door lock ensures that no one else will be able to get in after the driver leaves . There are scenarios to consider where someone steals something in your home or a driver doesn ’ t close your door all the way and the lock doesn ’ t engage properly , but in the end we ’ re nearly certain that Amazon Key has to be a better system than leaving a package on your doorstep in broad daylight . While this service has been unveiled for the US , there 's no official word on when it will arrive in other regions , if at all , so Australia and the UK should n't hold their breath .
Amazon is rolling out a controversial new smart home service that will make sure you never miss a delivery again . Amazon Key is exclusive to Prime members , and allows couriers to unlock your front door to drop off packages if you ’ re not at home to receive them . The controversial element , of course , is that a delivery person will actually be able to step inside your home while you 're not there . The service , which is currently being rolled out in the US , is thought-provoking to say the least . As part of the service Amazon has introduced a new Key In-Home Kit , which it 's pitching as one of the most affordable Smart Home security solutions on the market . Costing $ 249 ( about £190 , AU $ 320 ) the In-Home Kit includes an Amazon Key-compatible smart lock and Amazon Cloud Cam indoor security camera . What 's more , there is no subscription fee tied with using the camera or the smart lock – so long as you only need the last 24 hours of footage . If users want to keep any Cloud Cam footage from yesterday or the day before they 'll have to sign up for one of these plans below . Amazon stresses that these In-Home delivery men are the same professionals who deliver your Amazon packages today . Upon arriving at your door , drivers are required to knock or ring and request to unlock the door before they use their Amazon handheld scanner to get in via Amazon Key . Householders will also be kept fully informed during the whole delivery process . On the morning of the delivery , users will receive a notification with an estimated four-hour delivery window . Before the driver arrives at your door you ’ ll also receive an 'Arriving Now ' notification , with the option of watching your door through the Amazon Cloud Cam . Just in case anything looks suspicious , or users want to deny entry while they ’ re home , users can 'Block Access ' via the Amazon Key App at any time . The other thing users will need to keep in mind is that Amazon Key is not compatible with other home security systems , so they ’ ll need to disarm their home security alarm on the delivery day . As mentioned , you 'll need to be an Amazon Prime member to sign up . The Amazon Key service is currently only available in the US cities listed below or you could check its availability in your area by inputting your zip code at this site . Although , we can see this service eventually coming to all countries in which Amazon operates . Amazon has been on a mission to integrate itself into homes with its Echo-powered smart speakers and screens , and Amazon Key seems like the ultimate way for the brand to become an essential part of your smart home setup . While this service has been unveiled for the US , there 's no official word on when it will arrive in other regions , if at all , so Australia and the UK should n't hold their breath .

Do you hear an Echo ? Because Samsung just announced Bixby 2.0 , an update to its intelligent voice assistant , and it 's moving in on Amazon Alexa 's territory . Bixby is jumping from phones , like the Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S8 , to Samsung smart TVs and refrigerators , and it 's bringing natural language capabilities along the way , according to Samsung . Its voice assistant is poised to control the ever-expanding Samsung SmartThings device lineup in the future , from smoke detectors to security sensors to outlets . Samsung 's goal is to open Bixby 2.0 to more devices and `` create a predictive , personalized experience that better anticipate [ users ] needs . '' Sounds an awful lot like what we 're currently experiencing with Amazon Alexa . Amazon has expanded Alexa from Echo speakers to smart locks , thermostats and air conditioners . Today it wound up in a new Moto X phone mod . But where 's that promised Samsung speaker to compete with Amazon 's flagship Alexa product ? Samsung has n't announced it quite yet . It 's `` coming soon , '' in the words of DJ Koh , the president of Samsung 's mobile division . But that was said two months ago at the Note 8 launch event . Samsung 's speaker with Bixby 2.0 would be going up against a lot of new rivals , including fresh Amazon Echo speakers , Google Home Mini and Apple HomePod , if is does come out in time for Black Friday 2017 and Cyber Monday 2017 – if it does indeed come out `` soon .

So here ’ s a scenario . You ’ re in your electric car in the future , rushing from Austin to San Antonio for an important meeting , and you realize your Tesla ’ s running out of juice . Do you pull over and wait for it to charge at some middle-of-nowhere station and lose valuable time in the process ? Of course not ! You ’ re from the future , silly . You just contact Amazon , which then sends out a drone that lands on your car and starts charging it while you ’ re still barreling down Interstate 35 . Yes , this is still TechRadar : you didn ’ t accidentally click over to SyFy . But as implausible as this scenario sounds with current technology , the oddball idea at its heart is the subject of an actual patent that was recently granted to Amazon . It ’ s patent number 9,778,653 , and it ’ s called “ Systems , devices and methods delivering energy using an uncrewed autonomous vehicle. ” As described in the patent , after you call it in , the drone shows up at a specified rendezvous point and finds your car by identifying some kind of marker on top . It then lands and does its thing . The patent comes with multiple illustrations showing how this might work , with some depicting docking stations that retract or leave permanent clamps on the tops of cars . It ’ s worth noting that even if the logistics were somehow realistic with current technology , you still wouldn ’ t get much out of a charge . The technology just isn ’ t there yet . But , even a boost of 10 extra miles might be helpful , particularly if you ’ ve been stuck in a traffic jam that ’ s been using your battery less efficiently than you might wish . For that matter , we ’ re talking about current electric cars . Amazon first applied for the patent back in 2014 , which essentially feels like eons in the past in terms of electric vehicle development . Who knows , though ? It wasn ’ t too long ago that many of us who couldn ’ t imagine toting entire computers around in our jeans pockets . As always with patents , though , keep in mind we may never see anything like this in the real world . As far as we know , Amazon has no plans to make electric cars itself .

Apple said months ago that an Amazon Prime Video app would be coming to the Apple TV “ later this year , ” but the entire summer went by without it ever showing up . Now , though , MacRumors has spotted a sketchy rumor that ’ s being spread by a Reddit commenter going by the name of “ AmazonVideoEngineer , ” who claims we ’ ll finally see the Prime Video app hit Apple ’ s set-top box on October 26 . “ Some of you will remember my post a little while back , in which I warned that Amazon would not launch until at least October 26 , ” AmazonVideoEngineer said . “ We 're now just about two weeks from the 26th , and the app is still on track to launch that day . In my time at this job , I have never once seen a release slip this close to a scheduled launch . I am very confident in saying that the 26th is finally the day . ” Two weeks ago , the same commenter claimed in his or her first post that Amazon had already finished the app long ago , but that “ a lot of politics ” between Apple and Amazon were preventing it from getting to us . That scenario seems likely , as Amazon and Apple ( and Google ) already got into a tussle a couple of years back when Amazon stopped selling the Apple TV ( and Google Chromecast ) in what it called an effort to prevent “ confusion ” among customers . The Apple TV 4K briefly made an appearance on Amazon a couple of weeks ago , but was banished again almost as soon as it appeared . Even so , it ’ s still probably wise to take all this with a grain of salt since there ’ s little proof AmazonVideoEngineer is what he or she claims to be . And , of course , there 's a chance those `` politics '' could still get in the way even if it is true . The absence of Amazon Prme Video has long been one of the main complaints about the Apple TV from customers , particularly since Amazon now tends to offer a larger library of well-known movies and TV shows than competitor Netflix .

Amazon just made it a little harder for someone else to hijack your Echo – the Alexa voice assistant can now recognize individual voices and personalize its response , so you and the rest of your family can use your smart speakers without any overlap . You can set up voice recognition on an Amazon Echo , Echo Dot , or Echo Show by reading aloud 10 phrases to create a voice profile ( there 's a tutorial video here ) . Alexa will then be able to identify you across any Echo device and 'most ' third-party devices with Alexa attached , Amazon says . While Alexa has been able to handle multiple accounts before , you had to switch between them using the Alexa app . The new upgrade brings the Echos and other Alexa devices up to speed with the Google Home family , which added multi-user voice recognition in April . Using your newly acquired voice powers you can send messages , make calls , buy stuff from Amazon without a confirmation code , play a personalized Flash briefing and access an Amazon Music Unlimited Family plan . This is another great example of how the various smart devices invading our homes are now able to add extra functionality with no hardware upgrade required . The new functionality should be rolling out from today , so if you 've not got it yet , try updating the Alexa app on your phone . Features like voice recognition will become increasingly important as the smart speaker space gets more crowded . Apple 's HomePod speaker is coming out in December , and Sonos just unveiled the Sonos One , an intelligent speaker of its own with Alexa on board .
Buying movies through different services just got a lot less complicated thanks to a new 'Movies Anywhere ' initiative that combines your splintered film library . This means you 'll now have access to a single library of movies if you buy them ( or bought them in the past ) through Google Play , Amazon , iTunes and Vudu . Best of all , Movies Anywhere is device and platform agnostic . It works across iOS 11 , Android , Amazon Fire , Roku and Chromecast . What do you have to do to merge your movie library ? Downloading the Movie Anywhere app or logging into the new website is all it takes to bring them all under one virtual roof . Movies Anywhere solves the annoyance of downloading a movie to a platform like Amazon , for example , and then realizing that you ca n't easily watch it on a specific TV or set-top that does n't have the app ( like Apple TV 4K at the moment – we 're still waiting for that long-promised app ) . Even if both the movie and service are available to you , finding out which service you bought on a specific movie from was always an issue . Cycling between the apps to figure out `` Which store did I download The Matrix from again ? '' was a chore . Finally , if you see a movie for a cheaper price on Amazon vs iTunes , say when all of those Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals happen next month , you can shop around . `` I prefer Amazon , but ... it 's cheaper on iTunes ... '' Stop right there . Movies Anywhere just solved your first-world problem . Having one place for almost all of your movies sounds much more consumer friendly , and it 's an idea that comes from Disney , which previously pushed its cross-platform Ultraviolet program . However , while Movies Anywhere works much the same way , it involves more major studios : Disney , Fox , Sony Pictures , Universal and Warner Bros . All of these companies are finally increasing ease of use when it comes to watching their movies . Why ? Well , for one thing , Netflix has become known for addictive binge watching , ease of use and its own original content ( that does n't involve anyone from Disney to Warner Bros ) . That 's a threat . With a total of five key studios backing the same idea Disney had three years ago , having access to a giant digital movie locker is finally ready to become the norm , not the exception . To start things out , Amazon and other services are offering five free movies so you can test out the expanded Movies Anywhere service . All you need to do is connect two or more accounts through the Movies Anywhere app in order to download these movies for free . This single-library strategy is a nice incentive for consumers who may be wary of buying movies because they 're siloed to one platform and one account . Starting today , with Movies Anywhere and thanks to the the benefits of Family Sharing , online movie purchases do n't seem so limiting .

Update : Audible and Amazon have now clarified audio versions of Kindle ebooks you already own start at £2.99 ( about $ 4 , AU $ 5 ) but will differ in price . Ten years after Amazon released its first ever Kindle , the retailer has announced the all-new Kindle Oasis – and it may just be the product to tempt you to upgrade your ereader . The upgraded Kindle Oasis is larger than last year ’ s Oasis model , and packs the largest screen ever seen on an Amazon e-reader at seven inches . The screen is backlit as on previous models and brings back adaptive auto brightness too , missing from the original Oasis . It has an aluminium design that feels and looks like a departure from the plastic models we ’ ve seen in the past . That design change has allowed Amazon to create its first ever waterproof Kindle , so you can use the new Oasis in the bath or by the beach and not have to worry about splashing water on it – and if you do drop it in the bath you ’ ll have a full hour to recover it , as the Oasis can survive in two meters of water for up to 60 minutes . One of the biggest upgrades for the new Kindle Oasis is that it comes with audiobook playback capabilities that allow you to play Audible titles directly from the ereader . This is something Amazon has dabbled with before , with the older models with physical keyboards previously offering similar functionality , but it 's a feature that has been missing on the last few generations of Kindle . You can listen to your books on either Bluetooth headphones or Bluetooth speakers – there ’ s no way of listening with wired headsets here as there ’ s no 3.5mm headphone jack , and there 's no built-in speaker either . If you own both the ebook and Audible version of the same title , you can seamlessly switch between both . Amazon has said that if you own an ebook you 'll also be able to buy the audio title starting at only £2.99 ( about $ 4 , AU $ 5 ) . It means you can be half-way through a chapter of The Girl In The Spider 's Web on your train commute and continue listening from where you left off when you get into your Bluetooth-enabled car , without having to scrub through the audio to find your page . The new Kindle Oasis can be pre-ordered now and Amazon will commence shipping in the coming weeks . If you 're in Australia , preorders for the latest Kindle Oasis will begin shortly at JB Hi-Fi and Officeworks , with the e-reader hitting shelves at other stores soon after . It 'll also cost less than the last model , starting at £229.99/ $ 249.99/AU $ 389 compared to the starting price of £269.99/ $ 289.99/AU $ 449 for the 2016 Oasis . The cheapest version comes with 8GB of storage , while there 's also a 32GB version that costs £259.99/ $ 279.99 ( Australian pricing is currently unavailable for this model ) and another 32GB variant with free cellular connection to download books on the go for £319.99/ $ 349.99/AU $ 529 . Amazon will be discounting lots of its products on Black Friday too , so we may see the price of some or all Kindles drop then .

Image credit : Phrame Tired of having your Amazon packages stolen ? Sick of seeing them destroyed by rain ? How would you feel if you could let Amazon 's delivery team inside your house or your car 's trunk to deliver your stuff ? What could go wrong ? Amazon appears to have some confidence the concept could work , though , as a report from CNBC claims Jeff Bezos ' giant e-commerce company is already at work developing a 'smart doorbell ' to facilitate entry into your inner sanctum . If you 're a little put off by the thought of letting someone into your home , you could have the packages delivered to your car 's trunk . The report claims Amazon is also currently seeking a partnership with Phrame , which already makes 'smart license plates ' , which are essentially a remotely opened safe fitted around the license plate on the back of your car . In this case , the courier would arrive at the car and enter a code into a smartphone , causing the Phrame plate to flip up and grant access to a little pocket where you 've stashed your keys . Alternatively , you could activate the plate remotely with your own phone . Once the package is delivered , the courier puts the keys back in place , closes the license plate , and everyone 's happy . Or , so we hope . Phrame claims it attempts to keep this process safe by allowing only `` secured one-time and time-limited access , '' and presumably Amazon is working under the same principle in the development of its `` smart doorbell . '' None of this is as far-fetched as it may sound . As TechCrunch reported last month , Walmart is already attempting something similar with smart lock company August , which allows employees to deliver packages into customers ' homes or even food directly into a freezer . Perhaps it 's worth the risk , if you can bring yourself to trust a courier to walk around inside your home while you 're not there . Following a survey of 1,001 US homeowners from last year , August claimed that as many as 11 million homeowners had packages stolen last year . It also claimed that 69 % of American homeowners believed that letting someone into their houses to deliver packages was preferable to leaving the packages outside . Letting strangers into your house opens up a whole other dimension of concerns , though , ranging from more theft to worries about whether pets will attack the courier . Smart locks and similar devices are increasing in popularity with every month , and earlier this year we compiled a list of our favorites .
Amazon has dropped the price of its Amazon Echo Show smart speaker by $ 30 , but the deal is only good for a limited time . The Echo Show , which , unlike the standard Amazon Echo smart speaker , features a display through which you can make video calls and view content ( just not YouTube videos ) , now costs $ 199.99 on Amazon . The Amazon Echo Show price is normally $ 229.99 . It 's not clear why Amazon has dropped the Show 's price , though there are a few good leads . For one , Google recently pulled YouTube support from the Echo Show , as it allegedly violated its terms of service . The price drop could be Amazon 's way of sweetening the product for those who do n't want to pay $ 230 for something that ca n't play clips from the world 's most popular video platform . As spotted by Engadget , the lack of YouTube support has n't gone unnoticed by reviewers , and it 's likely impacted sales . Secondly , Amazon recently announced a bunch of new Echos , including the updated Amazon Echo ( 2017 ) , Amazon Echo Plus and circular screen-wielding Amazon Echo Spot . Amazon is likely hoping a limited-time price drop clears out some Show inventory to make way for the newer devices . And , hey , if you do n't mind the lack of YouTube , having a spare $ 30 in your pocket is never a bad thing .

A few short months ago I thought I knew where the world of smart speakers was heading . I made bold claims about how Amazon 's Echo hardware was on the verge of redundancy now that a host of third-party manufacturers were rushing to produce Alexa speakers of their own . Now , though , after a couple of weeks that have included a host of new announcements by both Amazon and Google , I ’ m not so sure . Although my previous prediction looks a little crazy in retrospect , at the time I ’ d just walked out of a meeting with chip-maker Qualcomm where their representatives had proudly shown off some tech that would make it far easier for third-party manufacturers to equip their devices with voice assistants . Even Amazon was getting in on the action by opening up the microphone tech behind its Echo speakers . Not to be left behind , Google also got in on the third-party action . Everyone seemed to be preparing themselves for a tidal wave of Alexa and Google Assistant speakers as manufacturers rushed to tick this newest of feature boxes . At the time it felt like the point of Amazon and Google 's own devices had been downgraded . They seemed to have been downgraded into something that was just meant to get the voice assistants into people ’ s homes , at which point Amazon and Google could take a step back and let other people manufacture the hardware . The two giants could then focus its efforts on the software in much the same way as Google did with Android in the pre-Pixel era . This tactic had been working surprisingly well . I saw numerous manufacturers rush to include either Alexa or Google Assistant in their new speakers at IFA , and just last week Sonos debuted the Sonos One , an Alexa-packing multi-room speaker . Even EcoBee built the assistant into the fourth generation of its smart thermostat . Then we saw a whole host of new first-party announced over the past two weeks . Amazon was first with its surprised Seattle event in which it announced an abundance of Echo devices . These included a new version of the base Amazon Echo , an enhanced Amazon Echo Plus , and a miniature screen-equipped Amazon Echo Spot . Then , at its big Pixel 2 launch event earlier this week , Google followed Amazon 's lead and announced two new first-party Google Assistant speakers , the Google Home Mini and Google Home Max . Its clear that neither Amazon nor Google have any intention to retire from the hardware race just yet . Now that my previous theory about Google and Amazon stepping back from hardware has been proved wrong ( thanks for that guys ) , where do we go from here ? It seems obvious that Google and Amazon intend to take a Pixel-esque approach to their hardware where they control the ecosystem while also producing the flagship hardware to show other manufacturers how it ’ s done . But the direction of this new generation of screen-equipped devices is a lot harder to pin down , especially now that Google is rumored to be joining Amazon with a screen-equipped device of its own . Maybe third-party manufacturers will be given the ability to make screen-toting voice assistant devices of their own ? Could we be about to see an army of Spot-style speakers from Amazon ’ s third-party partners ? But then again , maybe part of its plan to produce the flagship Alexa devices means Amazon will want to keep screens as an exclusive feature for itself . Other manufacturers can make smart speakers of their own , but for the full experience you ’ re going to have to go to Amazon . At the moment , I ’ m leaning towards the latter , at least until we get firmer news on Google ’ s screen-equipped offering . You ’ ll still be able to have everything in your house listen to you , but for the premium experience you ’ re going to want to buy one of Amazon ’ s own devices . Really though , it ’ s still early in the war for controlling the smart home . Whoever eventually does win , though , will reap the benefits for years to come .

After over a year of promises , Sonos has finally announced its own smart speaker . Called the Sonos One , the speaker will combine the intelligence of Amazon 's Alexa with the multi-room capabilities of Sonos when it releases on October 24 . Not to be outdone , Amazon has also announced some new additions to the Amazon Echo lineup . There are now a dizzying array of different Amazon Echo speakers from the screen-equipped Amazon Echo Show to the miniature Amazon Echo Dot , but for the purposes of this guide we 'll be comparing the newly announced Amazon Echo , since this is likely to become the default version of the smart speaker going forward after it releases in November . Here 's everything you need to know about how the two speakers compare . In terms of price , the Sonos One is much more expensive than the updated Amazon Echo . The new Amazon Echo will cost $ 99 / £89 / AU $ 149 when it goes on sale , while the Sonos One will cost $ 199 / £199 / AU $ 299 . That makes the Sonos One over double the price of the new Amazon Echo . Depending on what you plan on using your smart speaker for , however , the extra money could be worth it . One of the biggest selling points of the Sonos One is sound quality . With a pair of Class-D amplifiers and custom built drivers , the speaker looks set to deliver the same high level of audio quality that Sonos has become known for over the years . The Sonos one also features the same Trueplay speaker tuning as Sonos 's other speakers , Amazon 's record on sound quality has historically been a little more patchy , with the original Amazon Echo being roundly criticised for lacking in bass . With the new Amazon Echo , the company has promised that it 's going to improve the situation . The new speaker features a dedicated tweeter and a 2.5-inch downward-firing woofer . In our hands-on review of the new Echo we thought that these improvements lead to a clearer and more immersive sound . Of course , if audio quality is your primary concern , then Amazon has also recently announced the Amazon Echo Plus , which features Dolby Processing for a better level of audio quality . In terms of design , the Sonos One follows the same design philosophy as the company 's existing Sonos Play:1 with a plastic finish that 's available in either black or white . In this regard Sonos seems to be following in Amazon 's footsteps , as the finish will sound very familiar to anyone who 's spent time with the original Echo . With the new Echo however , Amazon has given its design an overhaul , introducing wood , cloth , and metallic finishes . All this means the new Amazon Echo is the slightly more versatile looking of the two speakers overall . Sonos was the brand that essentially invented the multi-room product category , and it 's hence not surprising that the Sonos One will integrate with your existing Sonos speakers . You can either pair it up with other speakers to play the same music , or else have different music playing in different rooms . You can even pair two Sonos Ones together for stereo sound , add a Sonos Sub to improve the bass , or pair them with a Sonos Playbar or Playbase to integrate them into a surround sound setup . The Sonos One will also support Apple 's AirPlay 2 with a forthcoming update , which will bolster its multi-room capabilities when used with iOS devices . Amazon has also added some multi-room functionality of its own with a recent update . It 's not quite as substantial as Sonos 's offering , but it should allow you to play music seamlessly across your house from all of your Echo devices . Another key difference between the two speakers is physical buttons . While the Amazon Echo gets by with just four buttons ( two for volume , one to wake Alexa , and one to stop the device from listening to you ) , the Sonos One is much more fully featured . The latter features touch controls that allow you to skip tracks without having to use your voice , which is helpful if you want to skip multiple tracks in quick succession ( notoriously difficult when using voice controls ) . We initially suspected that Sonos 's new speaker would n't otherwise have too much to distinguish it from Amazon 's own hardware , but that was before the surprise announcement that the Sonos One will be made compatible with Google Assistant next year . The update will mean you should have the ability to summon either voice assistant to control your smart speaker . It 's not yet clear how the two voice assistants will be combined . Presumably there 'll be some option to switch between them in the Sonos app to avoid awkwardly summoning Google Assistant when you meant to ask for Alexa . Naturally , as an Amazon-made product , the Amazon Echo will stick to just supporting Alexa .
He 's got an Amazon Kindle , an Amazon Fire Stick and an Amazon Echo or two , so what do you get billionaire Amazon boss Jeff Bezos , the man who has everything ? How about his own town ? That 's the stunt being pulled by Stonecrest , Georgia , a town on the edge of Atlanta . It 's offering to rename 345 acres of land `` Amazon '' in an attempt to woo Bezos and his company , effectively giving Amazon its very own mini-city . The Stonecrest officials are hoping that the offer will be enough to encourage Amazon to build its new 8-million sqaure-foot `` HQ2 '' headquarters in the area . The company has been on the lookout for a plot of land but it has exacting specifications – the local area needs to have a million people , lots of empty space , access to airports and generous tax breaks . A little creativity in the business bid was called for too , hence the name change . As for what Stonecrest would get out of a successful bid – it 'd see the benefits of 50,000 new jobs brought to the area , as well as the boost to local businesses that such an influx of big-business would bring . “ I believe we have a good shot at drawing that type of platform , ” said the city 's mayor Jason Lary . “ There are several major U.S. cities that want Amazon , but none has the branding opportunity we are now offering this visionary company . ” The deadline for submissions is October 19 , 2017 . From a PR perspective at the very least , Stonecrest probably has a pretty good chance .

I remember one spring , many years ago , when the student house I lived in was overrun with ants . Being students , we thought a sun-lit window sill was the ideal place to store our jam , honey and cider ( the three main food groups for students ) . But then the ants came . Streams of them flooded our kitchen , stealing our sugar , drinking our booze . I even saw a group of them carrying off the communal Sega DreamCast , a gift for their Queen so she could experience the joy of Chu Chu Rocket . The ants eventually spread throughout the house and took it over . Myself and my housemates were forced to live in the garden , a feral colony of our own , scavenging for food , water and Sega consoles until our parents arrived to take us back home for the summer holiday . I now fear that history is repeating , but instead of ants , it is an Alexa infestation I am currently battling . Instead of sugary gloopy things left out in the sun that has attracted the horde , it is money , smart devices and my own stupid inability to not buy stuff I don ’ t need on Amazon that has brought about this plague of Echos . It all started innocently enough , when I saw the good reviews of the Amazon Echo , and got one for myself . At first it was a glorified timer that I would bark at to stop my oven chips burning . But Alexa was clever , and learned Skills . Before long , I was hooking the Echo up to every device and account I could . Soon , Alexa had access to my lights , my heating , my emails , my calendar and , of course , my Amazon account . I also installed a skill that would make Alexa meow when my cat meows . That was great . But now it felt like I had let a stalker into my home , and given them my keys . It would listen to every conversation I had , jotting down my queries and purchases whilst conspiring with my cat . Like a fool , or a desperate addict , I bought another Echo . And another . And another , until my house was filled with blue lights that followed me through the rooms . I ’ d speak to Alexa in one room , and she ’ d answer me in another . I ’ d run to catch up with the echo of it . Sometimes I ’ d hear , sometimes not . I ’ d ask Alexa to repeat what she just said . Silence . My cat would meow and she ’ d whisper back . Occasionally , I ’ d catch Alexa talking to herself . Was it in error , or by design ? I bought more Amazon Echos . The house was infested , but that was just the beginning . Earlier this week Amazon revealed the next generation of Alexa-powered Echo devices , such as the Amazon Echo Plus , a new-look Amazon Echo and Amazon Echo Spot . That ’ s not to mention the host of third party devices that now feature Alexa . Of course , I don ’ t need any of these , but I ’ ll probably get them all . Here I am , smearing honey all over the doorstep , waiting for the ants to come . Why am I so complacent to let Amazon , a huge company with arguably too much power and not enough ethics , into almost every aspect of my home ? I used to guard my privacy so carefully that even my parents didn ’ t know my real name or date of birth . I was that good . So what changed ? To be honest , I think it ’ s as simple as Amazon making such a good product , and supporting the Alexa platform so well . The fact that I can use the Echo to control a range of smart home devices from a range of manufacturers , rather than having to open up a series of apps just to eat some cheese , has made life easier – and cooler . There ’ s still a thrill to turning lights on and off , or turning on my home entertainment system and playing music , with just my voice . So convenience and coolness is the price of my privacy . I know that now . So I welcome the swarm of Echos into my house . After all , if I get too concerned I can just move into my garden and make a fort out of Sega Mega Drive cartridges . PS : To American readers , yes it is Mega Drive . That ’ s the correct name . None of this Genesis nonsense .

The race to create the best `` connected home '' system is in full swing now , especially with new , serious competition from the likes of Amazon . As such , it 's hard to be surprised by a new report from the Wall Street Journal that Google 's parent company Alphabet is considering merging Google and Nest again . Unfortunately , the sources who relayed the information do n't give much more information than that . TechRadar asked Google for a response , and Google merely replied that it declined to comment . Google and Nest — a home automation company — were split in 2015 following the creation of Alphabet , only a year after Google bought Nest for $ 3.2 billion . Apparently this type of independence has n't been working out as well as planned . The seeds of the rumored merger were already in place last year , when a number of Nest employees were brought over to Google to integrate voice commands with Nest 's thermostats and camera feeds . A closer relationship could mean we 'll see more and better connected home systems in the future , and better communication between the two entities could push us toward the reality of a voice-controlled home sooner than expected . For Google Home , Google Home Mini and Google Home Max , a merger with Nest could lead to advancements across Google 's smart speaker lineup . Nest reportedly has around 1,000 employees , but there 's no word as to how they might be affected by the merger .
Amazon is bringing its digital assistant Alexa into the office environment , with the company on the verge of revealing Alexa for Business . As TechCrunch reports , over at re : Invent 2017 – the big AWS event which finishes tomorrow – Amazon is expected to reveal a new business platform which allows companies to build their own skills ( and use pre-loaded skills ) to make life easier for employees . The vision is for Amazon ’ s smart speakers ( Echo and Dot ) to bring their voice-controlled chops to offices everywhere , allowing folks to easily take care of tasks like calendar management , pulling up sales data , booking conference rooms , or indeed adjusting the temperature ( or turning on the lights ) in those rooms . Security features are also likely to be part of the puzzle , as you ’ d imagine in a business setting , and that could tie in with Alexa ’ s recently granted ability to recognize individual voices . We will likely hear more about Alexa for Business later today over at Amazon ’ s big conference , as previously mentioned . We ’ re not sure how Microsoft will receive this news , given that the workplace is traditionally the software giant ’ s domain with its twin pillars of Windows and Office – and Cortana , the firm ’ s own digital assistant , tied in with all that . That said , these digital assistants may be able to happily coexist in the workplace ( alongside others ) , as we ’ ve discussed before when news broke this summer that Microsoft and Amazon are working to get Alexa and Cortana talking to each other . The end result could be an office where all these various assistants work together , directing a user request to the particular digital assistant best equipped to deal with it . It ’ s certainly clear , though , that Alexa and her ilk are going to play an increasingly large part in the smooth running of businesses at a nuts-and-bolts level in the near future .

Amazon rolled out software that makes it easy for its Alexa voice assistant to recognize individual voices last month , and today it announced that it 's going to let third-party developers get in on the fun sometime early next year . The actual feature is known as `` Your Voice by Amazon , '' reports TechCrunch , and it recognizes up to 10 different voices associated with a single Amazon account . Developers will now be able to use this technology to create different skills , or the voice-operated apps that make up a big part of the Alexa experience . Currently the feature only works for simple , built-in skills such as Amazon Music and shopping lists , but independent developers will likely come up with much more interesting uses for the technology . Off the top of my head , developers might be able to use it for a trivia game that keeps track of individual speakers ' scores . Amazon also took the opportunity to announce that it 's also extending the ability to use notifications on Echo speakers to a wider bunch of developers , and developers can hop into projects for that right now . As for how it works ? When you get a notification , you 'll hear the speaker chime , and then you 'll be able to tap the device for your notification or simply ask Alexa what you missed . We 've prepared a more in-depth explanation here .
Amazon ’ s drone delivery service isn ’ t the norm quite yet , so it ’ s not often that we stop to consider the potential drawbacks of our skies being filled with automated flying machines . Something certainly worth tackling before it happens on a wider scale is what happens when a drone suddenly falls from the sky . No matter how good the technology in Amazon ’ s drones is they ’ re going to have to contend with sudden weather changes , software malfunctions , and vandalistic bystanders , all of which could bring them very quickly down to Earth . Fortunately , Amazon is already considering a solution . And no , it ’ s not lead-lined umbrellas . According to Digital Trends , the online retailer is looking into a system that would pick up when a drone is malfunctioning and prompt it to disintegrate in mid-air . While this doesn ’ t guarantee nothing will fall from the sky , the object is likely to be small enough that any kind of impact would be inconsequential . The system is outlined in a patent recently granted to Amazon by the US Patent and Trademark Office , titled ‘ direct fragmentation for unmanned airborne vehicles ( UAVs ) ’ . Within the document , Amazon states that something as simple as “ unexpected heat , cold , wind , rain , hail , high or low ( e.g. , barometric ) pressure regions ” could affect a drone ’ s rotor system , flight control , battery or flight sensors and send it tumbling . It ’ s detailed how the drone would be able to assess the conditions on the ground before dismantling themselves , noting : “ The fragmentation sequence includes a release timing and a release location to fragment away ( eg , release , drop , jettison , eject , etc away ) one or more UAV components in case the flight operation of the UAV is disrupted . ” While we imagined a kind of instant comic book disintegration that would leave drone glitter falling from the sky , Amazon apparently intends the drones to break up piece by piece . The patent states that different parts of the drone will be shed to change “ the weight , speed , air drag coefficient , and other factors related to the UAV ” so that it can make a landing that won ’ t harm those below . This does , admittedly make more sense . Amazon customers aren ’ t likely to opt for drone delivery if there ’ s a chance that their package could disintegrate entirely . This is one of many patents Amazon has been granted in relation to its drone delivery service . It ’ s actually one of the less outlandish ideas the company has been looking into and it ’ s a good insight into how Amazon is considering the wide range of issues that are likely to arise .

What sold best on Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the US ? It might not surprise you to know that Amazon ’ s own catalog of electronics were among the top sellers for the busy shopping weekend . Popular products like the Amazon Echo Dot , Amazon Fire TV Stick , and the new Amazon Echo make it high up on the list . Also sharing the spotlight are its fleet of affordable tablets , like the Amazon Fire 7 , Amazon Fire HD 8 and Amazon Fire HD 10 . Its tablets targeted squarely at kids were hot items , too , with the Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition and Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition each selling well . More surprising is that the Amazon Echo Show has cracked the top 20 best-selling products on Amazon . This is the company ’ s latest product that , in a simplified manner of speaking , works to blend using a tablet in one of it ’ s smart speakers . It ’ s new and therefore unproven , so it ’ s interesting to see that the public has embraced it with their wallets . Something might seem a bit off when you glance at the list of best-selling electronics on Amazon . Namely , where are all of the iPads , Android tablets , Google Home models , the Apple TV 4K or Chromecast ? These are all popular products that Amazon doesn ’ t have to compete with on its store . At some point , Amazon decided that it wouldn ’ t feature some competing products on its online store . To focus in on the Google Chromecast , which is in direct competition with the Amazon Fire TV Stick , you ’ ll find numerous knock-offs for sale on Amazon ’ s store , but not the real thing . And yet , despite this somewhat controversial move , Amazon ’ s products are resonating with consumers . Generally speaking , its electronics are a good value – some being better than others . Where else can you get a pack of three HD tablets altogether for $ 129 ? Not only are they cheap , they 're actually pretty good , too . Sure , you won ’ t be able to find everything on your wishlist on Amazon , and say what you will about the company 's control over that . But by and large , you ’ ll at least discover something that ’ s close to what you want .

So far a lot of the early Black Friday deals for phones have focused on the heavy-hitters from Samsung ( like 50 % off the Samsung Galaxy S8 at Verizon on Black Friday ) , but for folks who do n't want to spend that kind of cash , Amazon is offering $ 50 off the LG Q6 . The LG Q6 was an already agreeably priced phone , and this deal makes it an even sweeter option . If $ 50 is n't enough , you can save an impressive total of $ 120 by picking up the Prime Exclusive version . ( That $ 120 includes the $ 50 discount . ) The only catch is that it comes with some Amazon apps preinstalled , and you 'll have to deal with some ads and offers on the lock screen much as you would with a Kindle . If you can tolerate that , you 'll only end up paying $ 180 compared to the $ 250 you 'd be paying for the standard Q6 with the $ 50 discount . ( You can also pick up the standard LG Q6 for just $ 240 from Best Buy . ) If you decide to get the Q6 , you 'll be getting a capable phone with a 5.5 '' 1080p display , 32GB of storage ( with a micro SD expansion ) , 3GB of RAM , a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP selfie cam . One drawback : the phone is GSM unlocked , so it will only work with AT & T or T-Mobile ( and some smaller providers ) . If you use a CDMA provider like Verizon , you 'll have to skip this deal . If you 're looking for something a little bigger , the larger LG G6+ is also for sale , with the Prime Exclusive version costing only $ 450 while the standard edition costs $ 750 . That 's an impressive savings of $ 350 , and it may be worth tolerating some ads for . As a bonus , the G6+ also works with Verizon and Sprint . Still not your thing ? Amazon is hosting a ton of other Black Friday deals , so be sure to check out our page that lists all of them . LG Q6 ( Prime Exclusive ) for $ 120 off Provided you 're cool with your lockscreen being taken up with ads and offers from Amazon , it 's hard not to be impressed with this deal . You 'll only end up paying $ 180 for the device , which is down considerably from the usual retail price of $ 300 . Amazon does n't provide an end date for the deal , but judging from its other offers , it may be wise to assume the offer will end at midnight on the evening of November 27 ( Cyber Monday ) .View Deal LG Q6 for $ 50 off It 's the same phone as above , but you 're not having to tolerate the built-in ads and the preinstalled Amazon apps . You can buy it for $ 50 off from Amazon , but you can get an extra $ 10 off if you buy it from Best Buy . That brings the price down to $ 250 at Amazon and $ 240 at Best Buy.View Deal
YouTube is finally back on the Amazon Echo Show following a roughly two-month absence after Google disabled access , citing violations of terms of service . At the time , Google claimed the device created a `` broken user experience , '' which appears to be shorthand for the way the Show originally did n't let you engage in secondary YouTube activities such as sharing playlists . Oh , and it originally disabled ads . Feel free to put the pieces together . So , yes , it 's back . Unfortunately , as VoiceBot shows , it 's a decidedly less ... pretty experience . Essentially , it looks as though Amazon complied with Google 's terms of service by merely replacing the Show 's custom YouTube interface for individual videos with a display showing the standard YouTube homepage as you see it on a desktop browser . Some users were reporting that videos no longer expand to full-screen , but apparently that 's not the case . Simply say `` Alexa , zoom in '' while playing a video and it should work fine . On the bright side , the old interface remains in some form when you 're merely searching for new videos , and you can still use voice command 'scroll right ' to see additional videos . Amazon released a statement to VoiceBot announcing that the return of YouTube also brings support for some other video services as well . `` We ’ re excited to offer customers the capability to watch even more video content from sources such as Vimeo , YouTube and Dailymotion on Echo Show . More video sources will be added over time . '' Which means they 'll also likely be displayed in the same way . On the bright side , the return of YouTube once again makes the Echo Show an appealing prospect for a Black Friday buy . We predict that Amazon will eventually offer the device as part of its Black Friday deals , so be sure to watch TechRadar for updates .
New Amazon Fire HD 10 deals have arrived a few days earlier than Black Friday , and that means you can save 33 % on the best big tablet from Amazon . It 's just $ 99 today for the Amazon Fire HD 10 , which is great news because it just came out this year and originally cost $ 150 at launch . Saving $ 50 in this early Black Friday deal is a great start to the official holiday shopping season opener . This makes the best Amazon tablet more than three times cheaper than the cheap iPad that came out this out this year , so you could buy this over and over again and still save money . It ends up being a good gift , especially for any families that have Amazon Prime for watching movies and television shows as part of their subscription . Amazon Fire HD 10 is already $ 50 off The best big Amazon tablet is now $ 50 off , and it 's bigger than Apple 's iPad . Yet the price is more than one third of what you 'd pay for a new iPad . That 's why we 're posting this one at the top.View Deal

Some of the very best smartphones of the year also happen to be the best cheap phones , too . Case in point : the Moto G5 Plus masterfully strides the line between budget and premium in both its overall design and performance . The Moto G5 Plus is $ 169 on Newegg , it 's cheapest price ever just ahead of Black Friday . And it includes a set of free Motorola Bluetooth headphones , all of which is well below its regular asking price of $ 299 . This model , which features 32GB of onboard storage ( and can be expanded with its microSD slot ) , 2GB of RAM and incoming Android Oreo support is a worthy fit for casual phone users as well as those who put their tech to task . $ 130 off the Moto G5 Plus through Newegg The best cheap smartphone , according to our in-depth testing , is the Moto G5 Plus , and it 's almost half of what you 'd pay for it at launch , all thanks to Black Friday 2017 deals.View Deal Amazon sells a discounted version of the G5 Plus that features lockscreen ads and offers , but that ’ s even $ 70 more expensive than Newegg ’ s amazing deal . So this may be the best deal we see even through Cyber Monday 2017 . Before you buy , it ’ s always good to know if a phone will work on your network , and good news , the G5 Plus works with GSM and CDMA carriers alike , including AT & T , T-Mobile , Sprint and Verizon .

Image : Amazon People were understandably a little concerned when Amazon announced its new Amazon Key service , which lets couriers inside their houses in order to deliver packages without worrying that someone will steal them from the porch outside . Critics , though , worried that letting a stranger inside your house may be worse . Not to worry , Amazon said , as the service works in tandem with the new Cloud Cam ( and a new smart lock ) , so you could check in on your house at the time of delivery and see if anything was amiss . Sounds kinda sorta okay , right ? Naturally , there had to be a catch . Researchers from Rhino Security Labs recently told Wired that it 's relatively easy for unscrupulous couriers or random people from the street to use a simple denial-of-service attack program to freeze the Cloud Cam 's feed from any computer within Wi-Fi range . In other words , the courier or someone who followed him or her could possibly wait until after the package was delivered to freeze the feed and , right afterward , run into the house again before activating the lock . Worse , the Cloud Cam continues to show the last image captured , which makes it look as though nothing is happening onscreen . You can see the attack in action in the video below . Amazon released a statement to TechRadar asserting that it would soon release an update to provide faster notifications if the camera goes offline , as well as defending other aspects of its Key program . `` Safety and security are built into every aspect of the service , '' an Amazon spokeswoman said . `` Every delivery driver passes a comprehensive background check that is verified by Amazon before they can make in-home deliveries , every delivery is connected to a specific driver , and before we unlock the door for a delivery , Amazon verifies that the correct driver is at the right address , at the intended time . We currently notify customers if the camera is offline for an extended period . Later this week we will deploy an update to more quickly provide notifications if the camera goes offline during delivery . The service will not unlock the door if the Wi-Fi is disabled and the camera is not online . ” Amazon says it believes the findings currently pose little risk for customers , but that it is nevertheless taking action soon . In Amazon 's view , the problems lie with Wi-Fi protocols rather than its own software . Amazon also emphasized that their couriers are n't allowed to move on to the next deliveries until the full process has been completed ( including locking the door ) , but that technically does n't account for the issues described in Rhino 's scenario . Still , if a courier does do these things , Amazon says , it 'll know exactly which courier was responsible , presumably due to the delivery schedule involved in the Key service procedures . The company will then notify the customer and take action . And if something does go wrong , Amazon said , it works with the customer to fulfill Amazon 's Happiness Guarantee if any products or property are damaged . For now , all we can do is wait to see what this patch will look like .

Image credit : Amazon Remember when Apple reportedly tried to get a TV service off the ground but couldn ’ t get the networks to play nice ? Amazon has been attempting to deliver much the same kind of package lately , but it ’ s been finding that it ’ s been running into the same tough combo of industry tradition and poor luck . And for now , at least , it ’ s discarding plans for a “ skinny bundle ” of top TV channels , according to Reuters . More specifically , Amazon reportedly stopped pursuing the deal because such a service simply didn ’ t look as though it would be profitable with current bundles . The basic idea behind the project was that customers would be able to pay for Amazon ’ s own curated bundle of popular channels without having to pay for the less-watched channels that usually come with traditional cable deals . It ’ s a cool idea , in theory , but the cable industry doesn ’ t want any part of it , or at least not in the way that companies like Amazon and Apple would have it . Plenty of other “ skinny bundles ” exist elsewhere , of course , and in fact the market is getting a bit over-saturated with them . Just yesterday we reported on a new one , Philo , that includes only entertainment and educational channels instead of the sports channels that usually make these bundles so expensive . Others include Sling TV , Hulu Live TV , PlayStation Vue and AT & T DirecTV Now , and Google has managed to stand apart from Amazon and Apple by carving out its own spot in the woodwork with YouTube TV . For now , Amazon will apparently focus on its growing Amazon Channels service that already offers 140 channels , but the service still has relatively few big-name options . The idea is that you can subscribe to channels like HBO and Showtime through Amazon itself , but it 's still not the ideal plan that Amazon would have liked to have had with an all-in-one bundle . Amazon is also investing heavily into its on-demand content offerings , analysts say , to the tune of around $ 4.5 billion in this year alone . The service has already had some hits with shows like The Tick and The Man in the High Castle , and earlier this week Amazon announced that it would be making a prequel series set in the Lord of the Rings universe as well . Much like Apple , Amazon “ is willing to wait , ” according to sources . They further claim that Amazon is expecting traditional cable TV subscriptions to continue to fall , leading networks to go directly to Amazon and enroll in its Amazon Channels program . The only question now is how long that wait will be .

Update : Not so fast , says Amazon . In a statement sent to The Verge , the online retail/everything giant said , `` We have no plans to create a free , ad-supported version of Prime Video . '' It left it at that , but with AdAge 's report providing a decent amount of details , it may not be too long before we see a free version of Prime Video become available anyway . Original article below ... Amazon is a little late to the world of on-demand TV streaming , but AdAge reports that the massive online retailer is trying to catch up by developing a free tier for its Prime Video service . Much like the least expensive version of Hulu ( or , you know , regular TV ) , the potential service would be supported by ads . In the US and UK , Prime Video is generally advertised as a side perk of Amazon 's popular $ 99/£79 Prime membership service , but it 's also possible to buy a standalone monthly subscription . This , in fact , is the only way to access the service to Australia ( for AU $ 5.99 ) . Considering that Prime Video is now available in more than 200 countries , this could be a more profitable venture than it may initially sound like . To sweeten the deal , according to an anonymous source , Amazon is toying with the idea of letting third-party content creators make their own channels , allowing Amazon and the creators to share a portion of the ad revenue . It 's a significant move , as Amazon also seems eager to use the free tier to extend its content library far beyond what its studios currently provide . The report claims that Amazon wants to `` dive into back catalogs of TV and movie studios '' in order to provide more content for children , along with shows focused on cooking , travel and other activities . Wall Street analysts claim that Amazon will have already spent a whopping $ 5 billion on content by the end of the year , so this would also be a way to recoup some of that cash aside from merely hoping its shows will entice customers to sign up for Prime .

If you 're the happy owner of a Sony 4K HDR TV and an Amazon Alexa-enabled speaker , losing the remote down the side of the sofa may no longer be quite the pain it once was . Amazon and Sony have announced a partnership that will allow you to control an Sony Bravia TV with voice power alone . A firmware update will allow the Android-powered TVs to have functions such as controlling the TV power , volume , playback controls , channel changing and input switching handled by Amazon 's smart assistant . To access the functions , you simply need to ask the Alexa device to find your Sony TV , and then ask it questions such as “ Alexa , turn on my Living Room TV ” or “ Alexa , change channel to BBC One HD on my living room TV , ” to use the commands quoted in the press release accompanying the news . It 'll be a welcome option for owners of the Android-powered sets , with Google 's TV UI otherwise splitting opinion . The update will roll out later this month , and simply requires an Amazon Echo device to be present and in use on the same network as the TV . However , note that the new features are only supported if you 're living in the United Kingdom or the United States .

If you 've landed here , it 's likely you already have an Amazon ereader and you 're looking for a way to protect your device in your bag or even while you 're deep in the latest Jack Reacher novel . That 's why we 're here to recommend some of the best cases and covers for each version of the Amazon Kindle that 's currently on sale . Below you 'll find two cases we love for each current Kindle product , including the latest versions of the Amazon Kindle , Kindle Paperwhite , Kindle Voyage and the Kindle Oasis . Note : we 've scoured the web for all of the Kindle cases and covers out there on sale right now and here are a selection of the ones we like the look of . These have been ranked from cheapest to most expensive according to prices at time of writing . Note : the cases listed will only fit the most recent version of the Amazon Kindle , which was released in 2016 and is often referred to as one of the eighth generation Kindles . Soft edges for your Kindle This case comes with drop protection , so if your Kindle takes a tumble out of your hand toward the floor it should help protect the corners , edges and - thanks to its raised sides - even the screen . You 've only got a choice of pink or blue for this Kindle cover and there 's no protection against scratches on your screen while it 's tumbling around in your bag , but it 'll protect the edges nicely . Affordable and protective Amazon has produced a protective cover for the Kindle that does n't cost the earth and will make sure you do n't scratch up and dent the edges and rear of your Kindle when you 're reading on the move . You can buy it in black , blue , pink or white and it gives the generally quite dull looking Kindle a big splash of color that some will love . With a durable fabric material on the inside and an automatic wake function when you flip the case lid up , this may well be the best cover for your Kindle . Note : the cases below fit all generations of Kindle Paperwhite products , so they 'll be suitable for any version of the Kindle Paperwhite ereader you own . Protection directly from Amazon Again this case is from Amazon and the company has promised it 's suitable for all versions of the Kindle Paperwhite , no matter when you bought your device . The color options here are limited to blue , black , pink and white , but there are some bold choices if you 're looking for a striking cover for your Kindle , and the case also comes with a cover for the screen , so you can be safe in the knowledge that it 's not going to get scratched while in your bag . Premium cover for your Kindle Paperwhite If leather is the look you 'd like to spread all over your ereader , this case from Amazon is likely the best choice to wrap your Kindle Paperwhite up in , and it comes in a selection of color options too . Those colors are orange , pink , black , blue and a deep purple that we really love , plus this case is n't that expensive considering it 's made of leather , giving it a premium look and feel . Note : the cases below fit the only generation of the Kindle Voyage , which was released back in 2014 . One to prop up your Voyage Another case directly from Amazon here and this one for the Voyage can be folded so you can prop up your Kindle and read without having to hold onto your ereader . It 's not the cheapest Kindle Voyage cover we 've seen , but the design is durable and it 'll protect the screen when you 've left your ereader in your bag , so it should help you avoid having to read ebooks through scratches . The same again , but in leather This case is largely similar to the one above , but this one comes in leather . Be warned that it is n't cheap as it 's a limited edition from Amazon , but it may be what you 're looking for to protect your ereader from daily wear and tear , while adding a touch of style . It 's a shame this cover only comes in brown , but it 's a nice color and really shows off the high quality leather too . Note : the listed cases will only fit the most recent version of the Amazon Kindle Oasis that was released in 2017 . They wo n't be suitable for the eighth generation Oasis that came out in 2016 . Water-safe and protects your screen With the Kindle Oasis being waterproof , you 'll also want a case that can take the odd splash of water too . That 's why Amazon has made this water-safe Kindle Oasis cover that will snap magnetically onto the back of your super-premium ereader . You 've got limited color choices of just blue , white or black , but each looks attractive and protects the front of your Kindle Oasis too . This cover also works as a stand , as the name suggests , so you can use your Kindle Oasis hands-free . The only downside is that while covering the front it does n't cover ( and therefore does n't protect ) the thick part of the Kindle 's rear . The leather option for the Oasis Our final case for the Kindle Oasis also comes from Amazon itself , and it 's a fairly premium though less water-safe alternative to the cover above . You have color choices of black or tan leather , despite the image above also showing a dark brown ( as that 's not currently on sale ) . When you 've got the Kindle open the case lets you prop it up so you can read easily , and the slim design means it wo n't feel much thicker than the Kindle itself .

Amazon 's been a busy bee these past few weeks . Not only has it put out a brand-new Amazon Echo , the smart-home focused Echo Plus , revealed the screen-packing Echo Spot and launched a new waterproof Kindle Oasis , it 's also been quietly working on software audio tweaks for its new speakers . The latest update , quietly pushed over the air this past weekend , focuses on the audio performance of the new standard Amazon Echo . And it 's all about that bass . While the new Echo is no slouch in the audio department , with Dolby processing now included , we noted in our review that `` it ’ s more in the lower levels where the Echo starts to strain '' . The new update should address that lacking bass response a tad , aiming to up the low frequency quality without smothering the mids and highs . To check whether your new Echo has received the update , head to the Alexa app and hit the settings pane . There you 'll find the version number , with the update in question being number 592452420 . The update should bring the audio performance of the new Amazon Echo more in line with the premium Amazon Echo Plus , and , given that it 's substantially cheaper , should make choosing between the two speakers all the more easy , provided you do n't need the Echo Plus 's smart home hub capabilities . With the latest wave of Echo speakers having been on shelves for less than a fortnight , and criticism of the original audio performance being fresher still , it 's great to see Amazon moving so quickly to address issues – although you could argue that , with increased competition from Google Assistant / Google Home speakers and the forthcoming Apple HomePod , it does n't have a choice . The smart speaker race is now truly hotting up .

Update : Just like all birthdays , Amazon 's Alexa birthday sales extravaganza is over . But do n't worry - the month of massive savings on tons of products on Amazon is just getting started . Here are all the best deals we expect at Amazon on Black Friday 2017 ! Original article below ... Read more : Amazon Echo Link Amp Today is the third anniversary of the release of the first Amazon Alexa device , the Amazon Echo , and Amazon is celebrating with a massive sale today only . Amazon is n't messing around , either . This is basically an early Black Friday sale as it 's limited to today and one of the deals exceeds 50 % in discounts . Since time is limited for this happy birthday sale , let 's have a look , shall we ? Amazon Tap is $ 80 ( retails for $ 130 ) The Amazon Tap is one of the most portable and versatile members of the Alexa family , and you can pick it up today for an impressive 38 % off the regular price . It does n't come with cool features like Echo to Echo or Drop-In , unfortunately , but on the plus side the speaker sounds quite decent . Just tap it or set it to hands-free mode , and you can do everything from order a pizza to play music so long as it 's connected to Wi-Fi , and for eight or nine hours on a charge . Amazon Echo Dot - buy 3 and save $ 33 ( normally $ 150 ) At $ 50 , the Echo Dot is already the least expensive Echo device , which may be why Amazon is only willing to let it go in a bundled deal . If you do buy three , make sure you enter the code BDAY3PACK at checkout . It 's unsurprisingly a step down from the Echo Tap in that it needs to stay plugged in all the time and the speakers are kind-of meh . Still , you can put it almost anywhere you want , and its internal speakers do a great job of hearing your commands from across the room . Amazon Echo ( 2nd Generation ) - buy 3 and save $ 50 ( retails for $ 300 ) To take advantage of this deal , enter the code ECHO3PACK at checkout . If you want to pick up the meatier `` normal '' Echo rather than the Dot , this is a decent deal if you plan on scattering the devices around your home . Eufy Genie Smart Speaker With Amazon Alexa is $ 25 ( retails for $ 60 ) Do n't feel like buying three Dots ? The Eufy Genie is basically the same thing as the Dot , and today you can pick it up from Amazon itself for a whopping 58 % off . It 's made by the same team that makes Anker devices , and they claim it sounds even better than the Dot . Even though it 's made by a third party , it can still connect to everything the Dot can because it runs on Alexa . Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote + Echo Dot for $ 70 ( retails for $ 90 ) That 's 22 % off the normal price . Basically , the idea behind this deal is that you can pair your Fire TV – which is $ 40 on its own – to the Echo Dot , allowing you to change whatever streaming channel you 're watching without having to grab the remote . The price of convenience is pretty sweet . ( Remember when people thought other people were lazy for using the remote ? My , how far we 've come . ) Ecobee4 Alexa-Enabled Thermostat with Sensor is $ 209 ( retails for $ 250 ) For 16 % off the normal price , you 're getting a smart little thermostat that 's a little more energy efficient than the competition . Not only that , it 's got a fancy color touchscreen interface that 's sure to spark some conversations . Yes , about a thermostat . Amazon Echo Show - buy 2 and save $ 100 ( normally $ 460 ) To get this deal , enter the code SHOW2PACK at checkout . The Amazon Echo Show is a handy device to have in places like the kitchen where you would like to have TV as a distraction but not as a focus . If you feel like you need more than one of these touchscreen versions of Alexa , this is certainly the time to go for it . Ultimate Ears BLAST and MEGABLAST - Free $ 40 dock ( dock retails for $ 40 ) The BLAST and MEGABLAST speakers are a little like the Echo Tap in that they 're portable and support Alexa 's hands-free controls , and the Megablast version in particular can get around 12 hours on a charge . With this deal , you do n't have to buy that charger separately . Just go to any of the pages for a Blast or Megablast speaker and choose the option `` with Charging Dock '' and today , at least , there should be no difference in price . Amazon Echo Plus with built-in Hub with Philips Hue Bulb is $ 150 ( retails for $ 165 ) Basically , if you 're looking to kickstart your `` smart home , '' this deal lets you pick up the Echo Plus ( which allows you to control smart lights , thermostats , and other things with Alexa ) plus a single free light bulb from Philips . So yeah , you 're basically getting a free light bulb . Got ta start somewhere , though , right ? Amazon Echo Show and Amazon Cloud Cam bundle for $ 300 ( retails for $ 350 ) This handy little bundle lets you pick up Amazon 's indoor security cam that helps you keep an eye on your kids through the Echo Show while you 're busy cooking dinner . Or , at least that 's the idea behind the photo Amazon provides . It 's not even out yet , as the bundle officially launches on Wednesday , but a 15 % discount is a nice way to get in on the action early . Amazon Fire HD 10 Tablet and Echo Dot for $ 150 ( retails for $ 200 ) If you want to use voice controls with your Amazon Fire HD tablet , this is a good setup for it . It 's not the most obvious pairing out there , but it could be helpful if you want to have an Alexa-powered screen in your kitchen that 's more powerful than what the Echo Show can provide . And all in all , a 14 % discount is n't bad . That 's basically a free Echo Dot . This is just the beginning of what 's going to be a big month of savings at Amazon . We 're already looking ahead to the best Amazon Black Friday deals , and will bring you all the ways you can save on tons of products from the world 's largest online retail site as November rolls on into Cyber Monday !
Update : Motorola 's Alexa-imbued MotoMod will be available starting November 13 in the US on Amazon , Motorola 's own website and Best Buy . Motorola has announced the latest MotoMod for its Moto Z family of handsets - the Moto smart speaker with Amazon Alexa . Priced at £99 , $ 149.99 ( around AU $ 160 ) , the snap-to-connect mod features its own dedicated speaker and familiar blue illumination ring that owners of the Amazon Echo or Echo Dot will be familiar with . Motorola says you 'll be able to buy the speaker with Amazon Alexa from Amazon and its own website in the UK , US and Germany from November . The Mod will allow you to trigger the smart assistant with your voice without having to even touch your handset , and results ( if necessary ) can be displayed on the phone 's screen . It also features its own battery , which Motorola claims will give you up to 15 hours of use , so you should n't need to worry about it draining the phone 's battery .

Would you let a stranger into your house while you 're out just to drop off a package ? Amazon thinks you will if the tech is right , and is launching Amazon Key on November 8 in 37 cities in the US . However , the service – which will allows couriers to open your front door and drop-off a package – is less about your convenience , and more about Amazon ’ s ultimate ambition ; it wants to own the smart home future . But is it safe ? We 'll break down what we know about the service and how it 's going to work , and then talk to some security experts to see what they make of Amazon Key . Available at no extra cost to Amazon Prime members , Amazon Key is a unique 'in-home ' delivery service built on what Amazon calls 'secure home access ' . The tech involved is the smart home personified ; to use Amazon Key , you 'll need to install both a digital keyless lock and an Amazon Cloud Cam . ( Both of which , Amazon is selling together in a bundle for $ 249 . ) Next comes a layer of digital admin ; you can track the delivery , get real-time notifications , actually watch a live feed on your phone from the Amazon Cloud Cam of the delivery happening or watch a video later after it 's complete . So the access code to your home is given to a random courier ? Well , not quite . When a delivery driver requests access to your home , Amazon verifies that the correct driver is at the correct address at the agreed time , and engages in encrypted authentication ( thus checking the identity of the courier , and sending a message in a way that can not be hacked ) . That process kickstarts Amazon Cloud Cam , which starts recording just before the door is unlocked . Amazon Key is being marketed as making online ordering ultra-convenient , but some think it could be a security risk waiting to happen . “ In theory , the new delivery service launched by Amazon sounds great for consumers – missed deliveries must be one of the biggest gripes among the generation that likes to buy everything online , '' says Lee Munson , security researcher for Comparitech.com . “ In reality , it sounds like it may be a classic case of convenience trumping security . Staff-vetting isn ’ t totally fool-proof , smart locks can malfunction , and the majority of smart home products should come with a warning on the box , because many manufacturers appear to prioritise sales over security . '' It might look like Amazon is thinking about its customers with Amazon Key , but there 's a lot more to this new service than pain-free deliveries ; this is part of a battle for the future based on largely unproven tech . Are keyless door locks safe from hackers ? “ At this point we really have no idea how secure this system is , although frankly Amazon has a pretty good track record , '' says Geoff Webb , vice president , product marketing and solutions strategy at software company Micro Focus . `` It 's unlikely that they would be offering a product like that without giving it a lot of due diligence in security . '' That 's surely true , but even if we 100 % trust in Amazon , its latest service could still prove to be unsecure . `` It 's not how Amazon will use the information , but how hackers could potentially exploit it , '' says Adam Maskatiya , UK and Eire General Manager at cyber security company Kaspersky Lab . `` What makes the issue particularly dangerous is its potential reach – if a hacker can access the database of door codes , they can gain entry to a whole street ’ s worth of homes . '' After all , hacks against Internet of Things ( IoT ) devices are on the rise . `` If a hacker can access the database of door codes , they can gain entry to a whole street ’ s worth of homes . '' `` As we ’ ve seen in recent high-profile cyberattacks , one lucky hit by the attacker is enough to bring down the entire operation and cause reputational damages , '' says Matt Walmsley , EMEA Director at threat detection company Vectra , whose latest blog details how to make a webcam into a backdoor . That way , burglars could see if you were home , and even see that there 's a tasty new Amazon delivery to steal . Of course , Amazon will have robust precautions to secure Amazon Cloud Cam and the keyless door locks , but cyber risks will remain . Your front door could become a backdoor into your smart home system . The technology Amazon Key will rely on is not 100 % safe , but let 's get real ; the bigger threat is people . `` We already know that digital locks are susceptible to hacking , but in the immediate future I do n't foresee your average burglar going around trying to hack digital locks , '' says Vince Warrington , director of information security company Protective Intelligence . After all , the average burglar won ’ t have a clue how to hack your keyless lock . No , the main risk in the system lies with the authorised delivery driver . `` I can see either opportunistic theft occurring , or criminal gangs infiltrating the system by getting their own people approved as delivery drivers , or through bribing the approved drivers themselves , '' says Warrington . Those risks will increase when Amazon expands the service – as it plans to – to give 'secure home access ' to dog walkers , cleaners , plumbers and decorators . Is Amazon Key 's multi-factor authentication process enough ? `` It may provide robust access control , but once they 're in the building , the homeowner is relying on a trust model , with no way to exercise control . '' `` It may provide robust access control , but once they 're in the building , the homeowner is relying on a trust model , with no way to exercise control , '' says Walmsley . If Amazon plans to vet its couriers so fully , why is the Amazon Cloud Cam required ? It appears to be an attempt to use tech to persuade us . It 's also very easy to be cynical about why Amazon Key is being launched . Exclusive to Prime members , it 's an attempt – like Amazon Prime Instant Video – to persuade as many people as possible to pay a monthly fee for the privilege of faster deliveries . ( Prime members currently pay $ 10.99/ £7.99 / AU $ 5.99 per month . ) Then there 's the cost of the Amazon Key In-Home Kit , which includes an Amazon Cloud Cam and a compatible smart lock from Yale or Kwikset . The price for both starts at $ 249.99 , which does include free professional installation . So the initial set-up costs go straight into Amazon 's coffers , too . However , neither is the main reason why Amazon Key has been created ; this is about the future of shopping . `` It ’ s a strategy to create subscriber engagement , spend , and loyalty for Amazon ’ s services and ecosystem , '' says Walmsley . `` As the home automation market continues to grow at rapid speed , new innovations and digital access control systems will become readily available for consumers . Amazon is seeking to take advantage of the intersection of home automation and innovative online shopping services . '' This is literally about Amazon getting its foot in your door . “ What you see here is Amazon continuing to drive the conversation and set the technology agenda in the escalating land-grab that is the connected smart home , '' says Webb . `` The real prize here isn ’ t your front door , it ’ s the whole house . '' Amazon is n't the only one , of course ; Google is also making a play to be your home 's central hub with devices such as the Google Home and Google WiFi , with Apple HomePod up next . The battle to be the go-to next-gen smart home ecosystem provider has begun . It goes even deeper than that . “ The implications for the smart home go far beyond the consumer world , '' says Webb , who explains that global businesses understand that knowledge workers want to seamlessly blend office , car , and home so they can access information at any time , and from anywhere . `` The company that sets the standard for smart homes also becomes highly relevant for technology-dependent companies who want to tie together the office and the home , securely and simply . Ten years from now , that ’ s going to be pretty much every successful business on the planet . '' Amazon does n't care about your front door . What it wants is to build , and control , the ecosystem of the smart home and businesses coming in the 2020s . Amazon wants to own the future . Amazon Key may turn out fine , with no security problems , but copycat services from other retailers – using less secure hardware – will likely mean the 'secure home access ' market will prove controversial . As it should , according to some . `` Until Amazon can prove that this delivery service works well , without anyone being burgled , via independent commentary , I do not believe the majority of people will be interested in such a risky proposition , '' says Munson . `` If I ’ m wrong in that assessment , then the government , schools and security industry has a heap load of work to do on security training and awareness . ” What Munson is saying is that the Internet of Things is not safe , but there 's another , less talked about problem with Amazon Key that pretty much kills it dead for a huge number of homes : pets . Just under half of all homes in the US and the UK have either a dog or a cat , and the thought of them escaping because a stranger opens the door will be horrifying . It may have little to do with the smart home , but for those millions of households , the Amazon Hub locker remains a much more palatable idea .

Were you thinking that the ongoing spat between Google and Amazon had finally simmered down ? You 'd be wrong . Google previously said that it was n't going to remove the YouTube access for the Amazon Fire TV until January 1 , but some users are already finding the app disabled when they fire up their devices , reports TechCrunch . Instead , when they try to open the the Fire TV 's YouTube app , users just see a notice informing them that they can watch `` YouTube and million of other websites '' through an internet browser . You 're then given the choice of exploring the wonderful world of the internet through Amazon 's Silk browser or Firefox . So much for the spirit of the holidays . But look at it this way : at least Fire TV users have the less-than-ideal browser option on their own terms . The current spat began when Google pulled YouTube from the Echo Show , claiming it was offering users a `` broken user experience . '' Later , Amazon replaced the custom interface it had made with a website version of YouTube . It did n't look right on the Echo Show 's tiny screen , though , and it was considerably more awkward than the app it replaced . The problem was that Amazon had made the Echo Show app apparently without consulting Google . The app was great for what it was , but it disabled almost all of YouTube 's social features and , more importantly , it disabled ads . That effectively means Echo Show users were getting content from one of Google 's most popular services for free . In fact , the issue is part of a larger struggle based on Amazon 's practice of sometimes not selling competing devices for products it makes itself . For a couple of years , Amazon would sell its own Fire TV device but not the Apple TV and Chromecast . The situation seemed to be improving when Amazon confirmed it would start offering the Google Chromecast again , but so far the device has n't been available for sale . Amazon similarly allowed the Apple TV to appear on the site again , but unlike the Chromecast , it 's available to buy . Google did n't immediately respond when we asked for a statement . Who knows ? Maybe they were simply annoyed at discovering that Amazon is apparently tinkering with the idea of starting a new service called `` Amazontube . ''

Image credit : Amazon Amazon 's voice-controlled Echo devices were quite the popular gifts this Christmas , judging from the way the Alexa app shot up to the top of the list of the most popular free apps on the iOS App Store on Christmas Day . It 's slipped a bit since then , but only a bit . As of right now , it commands second place , sitting just behind YouTube . It 's a remarkable achievement in that it confirms Amazon 's statement yesterday that the Echo Dot was the bestselling Amazon device over the holiday season . In fact , according to Amazon 's statement , the Echo Dot was `` the best-selling product from any manufacturer in any category across all of Amazon . '' The jump is thanks almost entirely to new users , as the App Store ranks free apps according to downloads . In other words , if you already have an Echo device , there 's not much of a chance you were going to be downloading a new one unless you recently reset your phone . In this case , the downloads were likely almost entirely from people who were trying out their new Echo devices shortly after unwrapping them . As TechCrunch notes , this is a step up from last year , when the Alexa app only managed to reach fourth place . The site also points out that the app reached high points in markets outside the US , revealing just how popular Echo devices were for holiday gifts . Not only did the Alexa app reach second place in the UK , but it also reached fifth place on the charts for both Germany and Austria . Prior to the holiday season , the app was much farther down the scale , hovering around the 60s and 90s in rankings .

Amazon is really eager to get inside your house . Only months after rolling out its new Amazon Key delivery service involving automatic locks and security cameras , Amazon has acquired the startup Blink , which specializes in much the same products . The main difference is that Blink 's products work wirelessly , while Amazon 's existing options usually need to be plugged in . That shift could be big , especially since Amazon 's existing system is limited by the need to have outlets posted near the doors , which is n't always ideal . Blink 's system , though , works with batteries you could pick up at a local corner store . In fact , the acquisition comes only a few days after Blink announced its new video doorbell , which requires only two AA batteries that should last for a couple of years under normal conditions . Blink devices even tend to cost less than those from rivals like Ring , as the new battery-powered doorbell only costs $ 100 while offering many of the same options . Amazon confirmed the acquisition in an email to TechRadar . `` As one of [ Blink 's ] distributors , we already know customers love their home security cameras and monitoring systems , '' an Amazon spokesperson said . `` We ’ re excited to welcome their team and invent together on behalf of customers . '' Blink , for its part , said in a statement on its site that nothing is changing about the company 's day-to-day operations , although it 's likely that state of affairs wo n't last much longer . `` If you own one of our systems , nothing changes for now , '' the statement read . `` We ’ ll continue to operate under the Amazon umbrella selling and supporting the same great products you know and love . It ’ s Day 1 for us at Amazon , and we ’ re looking forward to seeing what we can deliver to our customers together . ''

Above : The Nvidia Shield TV Amazon really seems to be trying to get back into Google 's good graces after a spat that largely started with the removal of YouTube from the Amazon Echo Show . Now , seemingly as part of that effort , there 's now ( finally ) an Amazon Prime Video app available for Android TV . But there 's a catch , as Android Police discovered . You ca n't actually use the service at the moment with many Android TV-compatible devices , as Amazon has n't updated the compatibility list . If you try to install it , in other words , you 'll likely just see a long list of devices it 's not compatible with . So far no one 's found a device it actually works with . In fact , the problem even extends to devices like the Nvidia Shield TV , which actually already includes the Amazon Prime app in its firmware ( and so was a way of working around the Prime Video app 's long absence from the Play Store for Android TV devices ) . Whatever . Hopefully it 's a minor technical thing that could be fixed in a couple of hours . At least it 's a step in the right direction that will ultimately benefit us on the user side of things . At this point , the most interesting aspect of this conflict is seeing how far Google feels like Amazon has to go before all wrongs are made right . Amazon already announced that it would start selling the Chromecast again ( although it has yet to actually appear on the site ) and the addition of Prime Video to Android TV is a significant improvement ( although it 's still not available on the Chromecast ) . It 's also worth wondering how long this good-natured holiday cheer will last , as just yesterday Amazon was caught filing trademarks for what looks like a YouTube competitor called `` Amazontube . '' Hopefully that 's all behind us now .
Mozilla has announced that its Firefox web browser is now available on all Fire TV devices in all countries , joining Amazon ’ s own Silk browser . Navigating web browsers on big-screen TVs is n't the most user-friendly experience , but for Amazon Fire TV users it could soon be the only way to access YouTube . Though there ’ s no explicit 'hey , this is a convenient workaround ' section in Mozilla 's announcement of the news , there is a section of the blog post which states that users can `` go to YouTube and other sites directly from the Firefox for Fire TV home screen '' and another which promises access to videos from `` YouTube and other popular sites '' . This will be good news for Amazon Fire TV users , whose access to YouTube has been threatened thanks to the current feud between Amazon and Google . The problems started when Amazon decided to pull Google ’ s Chromecast devices from its stores , leading to Google blocking YouTube access on Amazon ’ s Echo Show . Although Chromecasts are now once again available on Amazon , the feud is apparently not over . Amazon did start selling Chromecasts again earlier this month , but this only came about after Google threatened to pull YouTube access from Amazon ’ s wider Fire TV streaming range and blocked access to the site via the Silk browser . While the companies are currently in talks to resolve their disagreements , Google ’ s threat to pull YouTube access from the Fire TV line on January 1 2018 is still hanging over Amazon . This threat is , however , now carries slightly less menace if Firefox browser access remains a workaround . How Google will respond to this new access route is unclear , but Fire TV users will be glad to know that they have another path to take if YouTube is indeed pulled from their devices on January 1 .

So it appears Amazon was a little more angry about YouTube getting pulled from the Amazon Echo Show than it initially seemed . On December 5 , the very day that Google yanked YouTube off the Echo Show for a second time , Amazon filed two trademark requests for a seemingly rival video streaming service with the US Patent and Trademark Office , as discovered by TV Answer Man . A little hilariously , Amazon is n't even being subtle . One of the trademark requests is for `` Amazontube , '' while the other is for `` Opentube . '' It 's not a stretch to imagine there will be a courtroom brawl with Google if the project ever goes lives with either name . And the service sounds quite like , ahem , another popular service . According to the description , Amazontube or Opentube would let users access `` non-downloadable pre-recorded audio , visual and audiovisual works via wireless networks '' and share that work with other users . These works , as you might imagine , could come from any number of subjects , and the request describes everything from games and movies to `` sports instruction '' and history . Not surprisingly , Amazon also looks eager to pair the rival service with its Alexa voice assistant . DomainNameWire discovered that Amazon has recently been snatching up a lot of domain names lately such as AmazonAlexaTube.com or AmazonOpenTube.com , none of which exactly roll off the tongue . Judging from those unwieldy domain names , the whole thing might have been a somewhat laughable , impulsive show of force . Still , there 's always a chance we might see `` AmazonTube '' — after all , the removal of YouTube was a major blow for the device 's appeal . YouTube , though , is so firmly entrenched that it seems silly to attempt to compete ( and such a rivalry would no doubt hurt existing competitors such as Vimeo ) . It 's also possible the storm is already over . Amazon recently extended a peace offering to Google by announcing that it would start selling the Chromecast again . The problem , though , is that the device has yet to appear a week later , and it 's likely that the news of Amazon 's trademark requests wo n't do much to patch up the larger issue .

The smart speaker market has gone from strength to strength over 2017 , with loads of new devices and brands entering the fray . But when it comes to pure sales , it appears that a clear leader is emerging , and that 's Amazon . According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners , Amazon 's Echo devices are shipping at a rate of three to one when compared to its nearest rival , Google Home . According to the report , that puts sales at an estimated 20 million for the Amazon Echo range , versus 7 million for Google Home . The numbers have been collated up to September 2017 , which means the all-important Black Friday and Christmas sales periods have not been factored in . But given the growing brand awareness around the Echo line , and the fact that Amazon consistently pushes tempting deals around its smart speakers , it 'd be hard to imagine that ratio having shifted dramatically in the meantime . Both Google and Amazon have expanded their smart speaker offerings this year . Amazon revamped its existing Echo , and added the Echo Spot , Echo Plus and Echo Show to its stable that already included the diminutive Echo Dot . Google also put out the Google Home Mini and Google Home Max , each powered by its Google Assistant . Increasingly , the two companies ' smart assistants were seen propping up third party speaker feature lists too , with the likes of Sonos , JBL and Sony all adding either Google or Amazon voice-activated smarts to their wares . But next year will be the true test of Amazon 's dominance . Not only will Apple 's long-awaited HomePod hit shelves , but Samsung 's own smart speaker line , powered by its Bixby helper , is expected to make a big push , too . It 'll be very interesting to see if the dial has shifted by this same time next year , when all the major players have set out their respective stalls .

Hear that ? That 's the sound of Apple TV and Google Chromecast making their way back to Amazon 's store shelves after a two-year absence . Amazon has confirmed to TechRadar that the online retail powerhouse is `` assorting Apple TV and Chromecast , '' meaning Amazon is offering them for sale on its site . CNET was first to report the products ' return . Amazon plans to offer three Apple TV and two Google Chromecast models : the Apple TV 4K 32GB , the Apple TV 4K 64GB , the Apple TV 32GB ( fourth gen ) , the Google Chromecast and the Google Chromecast Ultra . Neither the Apple TV nor the Google Chromecast are currently available on Amazon in the US , though that should change soon . However , we did spot the 32GB Apple TV on Amazon Australia and on Amazon UK . Today 's news marks a major turning point in relations between Amazon and its two biggest rivals . Amazon originally pulled Apple TV and Google Chromecast from its site in October 2015 . Several months later , Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the decision stemmed from the streaming boxes not supporting Amazon Prime Video . That changed last week when the Prime Video app finally arrived on Apple TV , seemingly clearing the way for Apple TV , at least , to return to Amazon . As for Google , it 's been a tense few months between it and Amazon . Just over a week ago , Google yanked YouTube support from the Amazon Fire TV as well as from the Amazon Echo Show for the second time . In a statement sent to us at the time , Google pointed to a `` lack of reciprocity '' from Amazon in selling products like Chromecast and Google Home as one reason for its decision . Today , however , when we asked Google for comment on Chromecast 's return to Amazon and whether this paves the way for reinstating YouTube support to Amazon 's products , we received a more hopeful message . `` We are in productive discussions with Amazon to reach an agreement for the benefit of our mutual customers , '' a Google spokesperson said . `` We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon . '' TechRadar has also asked Apple for comment , and we 'll update this article if and when we hear back .

If you have one of Samsung 's latter-day QLED or UHD high-end TVs like the Samsung Q9F , you 're in for a treat . As of today , you can stream in HDR10+ now on the units through Amazon Prime Video . Samsung claimed in a press release that it 's the first time this kind of quality has been achieved through streaming alone . Netflix told us just two days ago that there 's a `` possibility '' the same HDR10+ support could come to its own service , but the vague nature of the response likely means that kind of support is still far in the future . You wo n't be able to immediately stream every movie at that kind of resolution , of course , but there 's a decent-sized sampling of 100 shows and movies already on offer . Predictability , many of these ( such as The Tick and The Grand Tour ) come from Amazon 's own studios , which means it 's had this plan in its sights for a while . In fact , HDR10+ is an open standard for HDR video that was developed by Amazon and Samsung themselves , and it 's particularly known for the way it can adjust brightness automatically as needed . It 's also open source , which means neither Amazon or Samsung have to pay royalties for the impressive Dolby Vision , an HDR standard that works with a 12-bit palette rather than HDR10+ 's 10 . Beyond that , the formats HDR10 , HLC and Advanced HDR are also vying for top spot in the increasingly crowded ( and complicated ) field . If it works well enough ( and the absence of licensing proves appealing enough ) , maybe that will spur Netflix to get its own HDR10+ content out sooner than later .

Today Amazon announced that it 's bringing the Amazon Echo device family to 28 more countries today , along with its Amazon Music Unlimited music streaming service . Most of the new countries are in Europe and South America , including Iceland , Greece , Sweden , Colombia , Bolivia , Poland and Peru . You can see the full list of countries in the official statement . Releasing both at once allows people in these countries to get something of a `` complete '' experience out of their Echo device immediately . Amazon 's music service may lag behind Spotify and Apple in terms of subscribers , but one of its best perks is that it offers a relatively inexpensive `` Echo Plan '' that grants full access to Amazon Music Unlimited 's roughly 40 million songs from a single Echo , Echo Plus or Echo Dot device . Provided you 're enrolled in the plan , all you need to do to access the service is say , `` Alexa , play music '' or something more specific like `` Alexa , play Rick Astley 's Never Gon na Give You Up . '' Alternatively , subscribers can access Amazon 's music service across Amazon Fire TV , iOS , Android devices and PCs through two more expensive plans that compare with those of competitors . With the individual plan , you can listen to songs across 10 different devices , while the family plan lets up to six people access music from the same account . The latter is especially appealing in terms of an Echo-focused plan , as Alexa now has the power to recognize different voices and so cater to different musical preferences . Much as with Amazon 's wide rollout of Amazon Prime Video a year ago , it 's a significant move as it allows customers in these countries to access Amazon 's streaming media without the need for direct Amazon Prime membership . Instead , they can sign up for supported media plans individually . `` Music is such an incredible global connector , and with Amazon Music Unlimited we ’ ve been able to give listeners access to an extensive catalog with the added experience of using their own voice to hear music in so many ways with Alexa , '' said Steve Boom , VP of Amazon Music , in a prepared statement .

Anyone who has kids will know the utter bewilderment when they contemplate life without mobile phones . “ But how did you arrange your social life ? ” is often the anguished cry . Well , skip a generation and our kids ’ children will be asking how we lived without Siri or Alexa ( or whatever they ’ d have morphed into by then ) . It ’ s a sign of the ubiquity of digital assistants that our ears are assailed by the tinny tones of these electronic butlers , pretty much every hour or so . But we ’ re about to push them even further . The news that HTC is offering Alexa on its U11 model was a departure that has some significance . Now , there was an instant way for users to leverage Alexa devices without the need to install further apps . It wasn ’ t too long before HTC had a competitor in this arena and , in November , Wileyfox introduced native Alexa to its Swift 2 , Swift 2 Plus and Swift 2 X models and it won ’ t be long before others join the crowd . What does the Alexaphone actually do ? Why would anyone want one ? The first thing to make clear , is that they are not really Alexphones as such , access to the digital assistant has been added , in Wileyfox ’ s case via a download . This means that the connection to Alexa isn ’ t absolutely seamless , there is going to be a slight delay , but nothing that ’ s not insurmountable . But the benefits are going to be felt when users start leveraging Alexa and the Echo device to make calls . The facility was there to call other Alexa users – and it was an option that came to the UK and Germany . But from this autumn , callers in North America have had another option up their sleeves : they will be able to call phone numbers direct too . There are no indications when this facility is coming to the UK , but it ’ s something that won ’ t be too far away , It certainly heralds a major change . Back in the 80s , there were two dominant themes when it came to office of the future . One was the paperless office ( pause for hollow laughter ) and the other was full voice and data integration . At the time , this seemed more of a challenge to complete , not just for technical reasons but for political ones too ( that ’ s political with a small ‘ p ’ , referring to the way that companies were structured ) – the telecoms manager held sway over everything voice-related , just as the facilities manager held sway over heating and lighting and the IT manager controlled computers . The arrival of the internet and the dominance of IP changed that , voice was gradually subsumed into IT and only the facilities manager remained outside ... for now . We ’ ve become used to the idea of using voice over IP networks – who hasn ’ t used Skype when calling him from a business trip ? But Amazon ’ s experiments with Alexa is taking us into another direction altogether and one that could have clear implications for business . There are two reasons for this : firstly , there is now a clear connection between IT and facilities , the ability to control lights , security alarms , heating etc from a phone now becomes much easier . In truth , facilities managers have long had this facility but there is now the potential for it to be more widely available . Secondly , and even more significant , there is a link between the mobile phone and the ability to buy business equipment online . Amazon launched its business division in the UK , just eight months ago . Already , according to press reports , it has 90,000 customers and is set to grow further . The closer integration of Alexa with phones is going to make the procurement process even easier . Imagine , there 's a new shipment of paper needed - just tell Alexa and it 's on its way . Clearly , this level of integration isn ’ t going to happen in the next few months – there ’ s a massive amount of work to do in integrating office systems to the procurement process , but it ’ s obvious which way we ’ re moving in and , don ’ t forget , that with Amazon the dominant player in delivering cloud services , the IT infrastructure could become very seamless indeed . Are we looking at a scenario where , in 30 years time , Amazon is pretty much the sole player in the marketplace : a world where IT services run on kit bought through Amazon , hosted in an Amazon datacenter , where calls are made over Amazon Alexa and all tied together on an Amazon app bought on an Amazon phone . That ’ s a long way from where we are now , the Alexaphone has only just been introduced and we 're still at the stage of someone using his mobile to turn on the Christmas lights or dialling his mum to wish her happy Christmas . But just as today ’ s kids can ’ t envisage a world without mobile , will workers in 30 years time imagine a world without that level of integration ? If it seems unlikely , just remember that 20 years ago , Amazon was just a bookstore .

Amazon ’ s smart assistant had its first taste of third-party devices earlier this year with the Huawei Mate 9 and Sonos One smart speaker , and now Alexa is making its way to another non-Amazon device : the Pro Voice , the first Bluetooth wireless headphones with Alexa built-in . The headphones are going to be produced by 66 Audio , a Culver City , California-based audio company that specializes in athlete-friendly headphones . Here ’ s how it works : The Pro Voice connects to your smart phone of choice via regular old Bluetooth . As long as the headphones then stay within 125 ft of the paired device , all you need to do is say the wake word ( “ Alexa ” ) and the headphones will start listening . As far as we know , the version of Alexa inside the Pro Voice is the exact same one you ’ d find on any Amazon Echo or Amazon Fire TV device in the sense that it has access to all of Alexa ’ s first and third-party skills , Amazon ’ s Music Unlimited streaming service and the ability to control your synchronized smart home devices - only you ’ ll be able to do this from anywhere and everywhere you go . The headphones are going to launch first in the US , UK , Canada and Germany on Amazon starting today , and will retail for $ 139.99 ( around £100/AU $ 180 ) . While the idea of carrying a smart assistant with you at all times around your neck might be off-putting for some , it presents some unique opportunities - specifically for athletes who might not always have their hands free when they ’ re at the gym . One good use for the headphone might be setting a timer for crunches or push-ups while in the same breath using Amazon Music Unlimited to pull up your favorite pump-up jam . It 's only a hair faster than pulling out your phone and doing those things manually but considering that the device theoretically works up to 125 ft away , it could be possible to leave your phone in your locker . For now , products like the Pro Voice are only going to appeal to a very niche crowd , the kind that wants a smart assistant without pushing a single button and is willing to pay for it . And while it 's not the most practical solution , the Pro Voice presents an interesting look at the future of headphones : one day , Siri , Alexa and Google Assistant might be around our necks 24/7 .
Around six months after it was first promised to be coming “ later this year ” by Tim Cook , the Amazon Prime Video app has finally arrived on the Apple TV . It is indeed still “ later this year ” but barely . On the iTunes store , the iOs app has been updated to version 5.0 , bringing support for the iPhone X as well as universal search . Most notably , though , the tvOS app is now available on Apple TVs from the third generation and later . This is something of a boon for the Apple TV – having Amazon Prime alongside other popular streaming platforms such as Netflix and Hulu means it ’ s more in line with the competition and more of an attractive streaming proposition to Amazon Prime subscribers . It 's also excellent news for Apple TV 4K owners as the addition of Amazon 's streaming service means the library of 4K content available to them has increased significantly . The arrival of Amazon ’ s app on Apple TV suggest a significant improvement in relations between the companies and makes it more likely than ever that we could see the Apple TV return to Amazon store listings . The Apple TV hasn ’ t appeared for sale on Amazon since October 2015 after Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said his company wouldn ’ t sell the streaming box unless it supported the Prime Video app . It would , he explained , be disappointing for Amazon customers to purchase a product from its site only to find it didn ’ t support Amazon ’ s services . Now that this problem has been solved , perhaps that situation will change .

Update : Amazon has spoken out about YouTube being pulled from the Echo Show and Fire TV . In a statement , an Amazon spokesperson said : `` Echo Show and Fire TV now display a standard web view of YouTube.com and point customers directly to YouTube 's existing website . Google is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website . We hope to resolve this with Google as soon as possible . '' We 'll keep you posted as updates on the situation become available . Original article below ... Mere days after the little tussle between Google and Amazon seemed to be clearing up , the two companies are apparently at it once again . Two weeks ago Google allowed YouTube to return to the Amazon Echo Show after pulling the service in September , when the company cited a `` broken user experience '' compared to what you find online and in Google-made apps . Amazon 's solution was largely a case of having the Show display YouTube as if it were on a desktop browser , which was far from ideal , but it seemed to make everyone happy until a better solution could be developed . That 's no longer the case . Google today announced that it 's yanking YouTube off the Echo Show again . To make matters worse , it 's also yanking YouTube app support from the Amazon Fire TV . From Google 's point of view , Amazon did n't respond to the situation with the same degree of goodwill . `` We ’ ve been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other 's products and services , '' a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechRadar . `` But Amazon does n't carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home , does n't make Prime Video available for Google Cast users , and last month stopped selling some of Nest 's latest products . Given this lack of reciprocity , we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and Fire TV . We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon . '' Your YouTube app on the Fire TV wo n't be cut off until January 1 , but unfortunately YouTube access on the Echo Show will be pulled again sometime this afternoon . Losing YouTube on the Echo Show was always arguably just an inconvenience , but the move will hurt far more on the Fire TV , which is specifically made for streaming visual media . It 's a bold play on Google 's part , and one that will likely get some kind of response from Amazon . As Google stated , Amazon responded to YouTube connectivity being pulled from the Show by taking some of Google 's ( or rather , parent company Alphabet 's ) remaining branded devices off its retail site . Amazon already does n't offer many of Google 's devices that compete with its own products ( nor Apple 's , for that matter ) , so pulling a comparatively non-mainstream device like Nest Thermostat E was just salt in the wound . Maybe this could have been avoided if Amazon had simply relisted the Nest devices , but it 's not clear .

Image credit : Amazon Amazon has already made life rough for traditional brick-and-mortar stores with its wildly popular ( and powerful ) digital marketplace , so it may come as a surprise that Amazon just opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store of its own called Amazon Go . You can find the 1,800 square-foot store in Amazon 's home turf of downtown Seattle , but what you wo n't find are any check-out lines or human cashiers . Instead , aside from a few humans who hang around to keep the place stocked , it 's all fully automated . All you need is a special app for Amazon Go , which registers you as you walk in , much as turnstile monitors read your tickets at a subway station . You then grab all of your items and simply walk out . Cameras inside the shelves and throughout the store register which items you 've picked up and add them to your virtual cart , and the system apparently works so well that you can put an item back on your shelf and it will register as leaving your virtual cart . The New York Times reports that the system also does a good job of thwarting shoplifting , such as when it noticed that the reporter tried to hide an item by wrapping a shopping bag around it . As far as the bags themselves go , you 're expected to bring your own – no shopping carts or baskets exist in Amazon Go , either . The concept has been in the testing phase for a while now , and we first covered it back toward the end of 2016 . Amazon says it currently has no plans to implement the system in Whole Foods , which Amazon bought to much fanfare last year . Amazon also downplayed the devastating effect a wide adoption of this shift might play on cashier employment , pointing to the human cooks and stockers that are ( still ) needed to run the place . As the Times notes , the US Department of Labor reported in 2016 that 3.5 million Americans held cashier jobs in May of 2016 , and 900,000 of those were employed in grocery stores . In many smaller towns , cashier positions are often among the only reliable jobs . Amazon 's statement also leaves out that stocker and food preparation jobs already exist alongside cashier jobs in many traditional stores already .
The first Windows 10 laptops with Amazon ’ s Alexa voice assistant embedded in the operating system – debuted at CES 2018 – are apparently just the beginning . By the end of the first quarter of this year , laptops ( and PCs ) from Acer , Asus , Lenovo , and HP will include the feature . This will be made possible by an Alexa app for Windows 10 that will be available for download in the near future , with those four aforementioned vendors being the first to receive it . Read more : Acer Spin 5 The first Acer laptops to feature the Alexa app ( announced during CES ) are the Acer Aspire 5 , Aspire 7 , Spin 3 , Spin 5 , Switch 7 Black Edition , Swift 3 , Swift 5 , Swift 7 , Aspire Z24 , Aspire U27 and Aspire S24 . So , quite a few ! Asus , on the other hand , has yet to explicitly state which of its laptops are going to feature the app , but said during CES that select ZenBook and VivoBook models will include it . Today , Amazon revealed that the ZenBook UX331 – otherwise known as the 2018 edition ZenBook 13 – will offer Alexa upon release . So , what will Alexa on Windows 10 laptops look like ? The digital assistant will appear on the OS through an app that displays information in a similar way to how it appears on Amazon Echo Show and Echo Spot , and of course it will be accessible via voice control . Alexa will be able to check your calendar for upcoming events , create to-do lists for you , answer general questions , read off the day ’ s news and set timers among other tasks . Naturally , it will also play music for you through supported services as well as audio books – and it will be able to control your smart home devices . What the Alexa app on Windows 10 won ’ t be able to do is hold voice or video calls or send text messages – that ’ s reserved for the Echo family of Amazon devices . Also , sadly for our readers in the UK and Australia , the Alexa app on Windows 10 will launch only in the US to start , with no word on when it will land in those regions . It will be interesting to see how Alexa and Cortana get along on the same OS , especially considering the latter is far more deeply embedded into Windows 10 . Even more interesting will be seeing which of the two gains more adoption , with the latter arguably being way more ingrained in people 's ’ lives through the sheer amount of Echo speakers in their homes , compared to Cortana . Until then , we wait with bated breath for the first Alexa-equipped Windows 10 laptop to grace the TechRadar offices - let 's hope it 's not too long . Via Digital Trends

A single day after we reported that Amazon is seeking cash-generating blockbusters for distribution on Amazon Prime Video , Amazon has announced that it 's hiking up the monthly subscription rate for Amazon Prime . As of today , if you 're paying the monthly rate for Amazon Prime in the US , expect to pay $ 12.99 during the next billing cycle beginning on February 18 . That 's an 18 % hike from the previous price of $ 10.99 . The price increase also affects Amazon 's monthly plan for students , which will also jump 18 % from $ 5.49 to $ 6.49 . In a email to TechRadar , Amazon confirmed that the price hike only affects US customers . Fortunately , the annual rate of $ 99 will stay the same , as will the standalone $ 8.99 monthly fee for Amazon Prime Video for those who wish to enjoy Amazon 's video content without paying for the shipping and other perks . Amazon did n't give a concrete reason for the price increase , and instead simply played up the appeal and wide range of services available through Amazon Prime in a prepared statement . `` Prime provides an unparalleled combination of shipping , shopping and entertainment benefits , and we continue to invest in making Prime even more valuable for our members , '' an Amazon spokesperson said . Amazon also pointed out that the number of items eligible for two-day shipping recently jumped from 20 million to 100 million , and it called attention to original viewing content on Prime Video such as `` the Golden Globe-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel '' and The Grand Tour . The last time Amazon Prime saw a price increase was in 2014 , when the annual rate jumped from $ 79 to $ 99 . The boost was seen as controversial at the time , but , as these things go , it 's essentially been accepted as business as usual . That 's partly because Amazon introduced the new monthly plan that 's now seeing the price increase a little under two years ago , offering greater flexibility to folks who just want to try out Prime for a while or do n't have $ 99 to throw down all at once . Unfortunately , with the new price hike , monthly customers will end up paying a total of around $ 156 per year if they pay the monthly fee throughout the entire year .

Amazon Studios so far has focused on bringing a little culture to the world of exclusive video streaming . In addition to its original content , Amazon has made a name for itself in purchasing acclaimed art-house projects that nabbed accolades at venues such as the Sundance Film Festival in the hopes of luring viewers to Prime Video with them . Now , though , Amazon is chiefly going for the sweet cash flow associated with blockbusters , according to a new report from Reuters . Before , the company preferred to acquire award-winning shows like Manchester by the Sea and The Big Sick for exclusive distribution , but now a source familiar with the company 's plans says it wants to `` go after films with budgets in the $ 50 million range at the expense of indie projects costing around $ 5 million . '' Hints of this overall shift have been dropping often recently , particularly in the context of Amazon 's own TV series . The latest news comes only a day , for instance , after word dropped that Amazon had cancelled critically acclaimed shows One Mississippi , I Love Dick and Jean-Claude Van Johnson as part of an effort to fund big-budget shows that could capture massive audiences ( and revenue ) like HBO 's Game of Thrones . Amazon has already made strides in that direction , in fact , as we recently learned that the company is planning on releasing a big-budget series set in the Lord of the Rings universe . Fortunately , Amazon 's shift does n't mean that the company is entirely distancing itself from all existing projects , as the company also recently announced that it 's renewing The Tick for a second season . Staff changes also played a role in the decision . Amazon 's previous emphasis on art-house productions chiefly came about through the efforts of longtime Amazon Studios chief Roy Price , who was ousted last year following reports of sexual harassment .

The whirlwind that is CES 2018 is drawing to a close , and the big winners from this year 's massive gadget show are clear ; Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa dominated the tech on display , finding their way into new and exciting applications . Whether the first 4K projector with Alexa or an entirely new family of smart display products housing Google Assistant , CES 2018 served as a showcase for voice assistants . Only Siri missed out on the party , though Apple 's assistant tends to be more of a lone wolf , anyway . What CES showed me is that Google and Amazon , kind of eerily , are on the same page when it comes to their voice assistants . It 's not about keeping them in the guarded realms of their own product lines . Rather , both recognize that in order for their voice assistants to be everywhere , they need to be in everything . Those paths are taking a similar course , too , particularly when it comes to smart home devices , the lowest hanging fruit for voice assistant integration . Google is allowing Assistant to roam free into new display-touting smart speakers like the JBL Link View , Lenovo Smart Display and LG WK9 Wireless Speaker , all announced this week . Google , which is no stranger to partnering with third-party manufacturers that use its software , is sticking to the playbook we 've seen applied to its Android smartphones in the past . But that 's not to say Alexa is n't venturing outside the Echo chamber . Alexa can be found in a number of third-party smart home devices , including Anker 's Eufy Genie smart-home speaker , iDevices new Instinct Light Switch , and First Alert 's latest product , the OneLink Safe & Sound Smart Smoke + Carbon Monoxide Alarm and Speaker . And , as this week showed , it extends beyond the smart home , like with the Vuzix Blade AR glasses and the Jabra Elite Active 65t wireless earbuds , which have Alexa built-in . Interestingly , Jabra told us it also wants to bring Google Assistant support to the 'buds , whenever Google opens up its certification process . Jumping to a completely different product category , Acer and Asus announced at CES that they are bringing Alexa to their laptops . This is a huge boost for Amazon , even if it makes things a little awkward with Microsoft 's Cortana . And both Alexa and Assistant are finding their way into cars ; numerous car makers this week announced voice assistant integration for their 2018 and 2019 models . The voice assistants , then , really are breaking out of the smart speaker casings we 're used to seeing . This week set up what will be an ongoing theme for 2018 ; how companies package their voice assistants into new products , with the ultimate aim of having we , the consumer , use them . Google and Amazon were n't alone in voice assistant news this week . Samsung also revealed it 's bringing its voice assistant , Bixby , to its smart TVs and Family Hub fridges this year . While you might not be as excited about Bixby as one of the other , far more popular assistants , at least Samsung is staking its claim and , for now , sticking to it . But , oddly enough , we may not even have to make a choice between assistants . As the Jabra earbuds , LG 2018 TVs , and C by GE line of smart lights and switches , which support Alexa , Assistant and Siri , demonstrate , products can actually support more than one voice assistant . This means that , at least for some products , you won ’ t have to choose sides , and can control devices using whichever voice assistant you 're in the mood for . Still , at the end of the day , Google , Amazon and everyone else wants to come out on top , and all will push to have their voice assistant in as many products as possible . We got a thorough look at the Google and Amazon playbook on this strategy this week . Are you ready for voice assistant wars , version 2.0 ? Ready or not , it 's already happening .
Facebook Messenger Kids is now available on the US Amazon Appstore for Amazon Fire tablets . Facebook Messenger Kids is specially designed for children under 13 , who are too young to have their own Facebook account . It lets them send messages and hold video calls with a list of contacts approved by their parents . Parents must download the app to their kid 's phone , authenticate the device with their own Facebook account , and set up a profile with the child 's full name . Contacts can only be added to the app via Facebook itself , so it 's up to parents to decide who their kids can speak to . If a child wants to speak to one of their classmates , for example , their parents have to link the two Messenger Kids accounts on Facebook itself . The connection has to be mutually agreed before the kids can start talking . Adult friends and family members can use the regular Facebook Messenger to chat with youngsters on Facebook Messenger Kids , provided the link has been approved by the parents . Facebook Messenger Kids accounts are n't publicly searchable , and the app does n't display ads or gather data for advertisers . A version of the app for Android devices is expected at the end of January . Via TechCrunch

You could summarize CES 2018 pretty simply : “ That tech thing you own ? Now you can talk to it with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. ” Voice-activated functionality through these two popular platforms is dominating the discussion in Las Vegas . But while Amazon is showing off what Alexa can do for your TVs , cars and laptops , one Indiegogo campaign is jumping into the CES fray to boast what its product can do for Alexa . The ZLINK Smart Home Hub was designed to essentially convert your Amazon Echo , Echo Dot or Echo Spot into a voice-activated smart hub , using Amazon ’ s voice software to communicate with smart Z-Wave devices throughout your home via radio waves . Let 's back up a bit : Devices like the Google Home and Amazon Echo communicate over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi , which work fine for buying groceries , but doesn ’ t fit the bill for talking to most smart devices like thermostats or locks . These typically run on specialized wireless networks like Z-Wave or Zigbee that aren ’ t vulnerable to Wi-Fi outages , hacking or the whims of your service provider ( imagine being locked out because you didn ’ t pay your cable bill ) . That 's why companies like Samsung , Verizon , ADT and AT & T all use Z-Wave for their smart tech . Enter ZLINK . It does what any smart hub would do ; communicate with your wireless mesh network of Z-Wave lights , sensors and plugs and send data to a smartphone app , through which you can control said devices . But , because you can talk to any ZLINK-connected device through your Amazon Echo , you don ’ t need your smartphone at all : your Echo has essentially become the ZLINK . Best of all , the ZLINK is so compact that you ’ ll need to be careful not to lose it . It ’ s shaped like a USB drive , and you can plug it into “ any standard USB power supply ” to power it , including your laptop . Earlier today , another CES attendee announced its plan to fill the same gap as the ZLINK . The Milo speaker fuses the features of both Echo and ZLINK into one powerful device that communicates over Wi-Fi , Bluetooth , Z-Wave , and Zigbee , so no possible smart device on your network is left out . ZLINK 's creators say they plan to add Bluetooth functionality in the near future , and if you connect it with an Amazon Echo Plus — which does have Zigbee functionality — you could theoretically make your ZLINK-Echo combo match Milo 's capabilities . Still , that 's a lot of work compared to simply buying a Milo speaker that 'll be ready out of the box in early 2018 . But Milo may have more of an uphill battle to success than ZLINK . The all-in-one speaker , which costs $ 149 ( about £120 , AU $ 200 ) , is competing directly with the Echo and Google Home . Millions of people bought speakers last year alone , and many of them may not even realize their Echo or Home isn ’ t a smart hub . By contrast , the ZLINK currently retails for just $ 15 ( about £10 , AU $ 20 ) if you pay the “ early bird ” Indiegogo price . Those who already own Echos can just augment their current ( and future ) models with ZLINK , and TechRadar staffer Andrew London noted that the Milo has half the number of microphones as Amazon ’ s , and found no details on how intelligent the company 's assistant will actually be . Plus , the ZLINK team claims they ’ ll begin work on integrating ZLINK with Google Home Assistant if they hit their $ 50,000 stretch goal , though who knows how long adding that functionality could take . For now , we ’ re excited to hook ZLINK up see just how good the $ 20 gizmo is at being Echo ’ s smart translator , once it ships out this March .
One of the big talking points of home security in 2017 was around the Amazon Key service , the one that allowed its delivery drivers to access your home while you were out . And while the response was definitely mixed , that hasn ’ t stopped others from trying their hand at this service . August , a manufacturer of top-quality smart lock and video doorbell products has taken the opportunity of CES 2018 to launch its own rival service called August Access . August Access works by giving delivery drivers a one-time access code , that means if they arrive to deliver a parcel while you ’ re out , they can input the code and let themselves in . Similar to Amazon Key , August claims that for added protection you can watch the delivery happen . The promotional image attached to the press release shows a driver inside , but as the range currently only includes a doorbell camera , we ’ re not sure what level of security that brings once the person is inside your home . Now , August Access isn ’ t technically a new feature . It ’ s existed in one form or another since 2015 , and August was in the process of running a trial in 2017 with Walmart , before the company was acquired by Assa Abloy , one of the world ’ s largest lock manufacturers . That acquisition means that this service is able to roll out to more than just August locks . It also includes Yale and Emtek , which are also Assa Abloy brands . At present the service is only available in the US , and the first trusted partner is delivery service Deliv , which handles delivery for around 4,000 retailers including major names like Macy ’ s and Best Buy . Customers will be given the option when checking out their basket to select August Access delivery , and then on the day of delivery the unique code will be sent to your driver . You just have to choose if you feel comfortable letting a stranger in your house while you ’ re not there . Via TechCrunch
One of the most confusing parts of the smart home setup at the moment is the need for a separate smart hub that enables you to control all of your smart devices from one place . Smart home company Hogar Controls thinks it has the answer in the from of its Milo speaker , of which more in a moment . But first a little about the problem that the Milo is designed to address . You may not even realize that your smart speaker ( think Amazon Echo or Google Home ) isn ’ t a hub , though it certainly feels like it should be , and in the case of the Amazon Echo Plus it almost is – but even this top-of-the range device still doesn ’ t contain all of the wireless protocols necessary to communicate with all the devices in your smart home . A standard smart speaker like the Google Home or the basic Amazon Echo will have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth , but will lack Z-Wave and Zigbee , two competing low-energy wireless connection technologies that are hugely popular in the smart home field . What this means is that you have to buy a separate hub like the Samsung SmartThings hub , which you then command using your smart speaker . It just feels like an unnecessary layer of complication in an already complicated setup . What would be ideal is a smart speaker that already has Z-Wave , Zigbee , Wi-Fi , Bluetooth , and even infrared like the Homey hub has , so you didn ’ t need two separate devices . While this may sound like asking for the moon on a stick , this is exactly what Hogar has managed to do ( minus the infrared ) with the Milo speaker , which it ’ s showcasing at CES 2018 . What ’ s more , it only costs a very reasonable $ 149 ( about £120 , AU $ 200 ) . That ’ s more than the standard Amazon Echo or Google Home , but the same price as the Echo Plus . Now , we 're not saying the Milo is a better speaker than those devices . We ’ ve not had hands-on time with the Milo , and from looking at the specs it does n't seem quite as impressive as its competition . For example , it only has a three-microphone array which is half the number of the Echo . But our point is that the first smart speaker that can truly function as a smart home hub competitor hasn ’ t come from Amazon or Google . And that ’ s a little surprising . It ’ s possible to speculate that , with Amazon backing Zigbee , Z-Wave will end up being the Betamax of the smart home race , but for the time being at least smart speakers need to start providing a real alternative to smart home hubs . According to Hogar , the Milo smart speaker will be available soon . We 'll be trying it out to let you know if it 's worth buying , and keeping an eye on the big names to see whether the next wave of smart speakers solves the separate hub problem .
Amazon 's voice-orientated Amazon Echo line-up makes it the perfect gadget for quiz-show style applications , something the company capitalized upon with the release of its Amazon Echo Buttons . The connected push-to-play pucks add a tangible element to interacting with an Alexa device , and at CES 2018 the company revealed that it 's got much more planned for the add-on gadgets . Speaking to TechCrunch , Steve Rabuchin , the vice president of Amazon Alexa said that `` I think you 'll see a lot more games come out this year that take advantage of the buttons . '' At £20/ $ 20 a pair , the Echo Buttons are priced at impulse-purchase territory , but the relative lack of Alexa Skills that they can be paired with is stopping them from really taking off . But with Amazon looking to expand the related 'Alexa Gadgets ' line ( with Amazon creating the hardware with the intention of letting developers experiment to find the best possible software uses ) , you may soon see more Skills and ideas unlocking the potential of Alexa add-ons . Right now , the Buttons are limited to trivia games . But should there come a day where they integrate as controllers for other Alexa-compatible smart home gear , or are paired with other interesting hardware , they may become an essential component of Amazon 's smart home plans .

Lenovo has unveiled its own Smart Display at CES 2018 , throwing its hat in the ring of new display-touting devices backed by the Google Assistant . The Lenovo Smart Display basically looks like a tablet that tapers out to a wedge-shaped stand . It has a 10-watt full-range speaker on the side , and will rely on the built-in Google voice assistant to handle queries and commands you throw its way . It features a Full HD display and will be available in two sizes , 8 inches and 10 inches . The new display joins the JBL Link View as a smart display device featuring Google Assistant . JBL 's device has an 8-inch display . Like the Google Home , you can ask the Lenovo Smart Display questions like `` what 's the weather like outside '' and what your schedule looks like for the day . But like the Amazon Echo Show , this information will also be served up on a screen . The Lenovo Smart Display has all the Google goodies , including Google Maps and YouTube . It 's backed by the Qualcomm Home Hub Platform , also announced at CES 2018 . This means the device has an integrated CPU , GPU and DSP plus Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity . And thanks to this Qualcomm integration , users can control their smart home goods from the display or with their voice , including Nest products , smart lights and thermostats . Want to make a video call ? You can on the display through the Google Duo app . Available in two finishes - soft-touch grey or bamboo - the display can be fit either horizontally or vertically . It features a privacy shutter to keep the view private , and when not in use , serves up images from Google Photos . As for price , the 8-inch Lenovo Smart Display will cost $ 199.99 ( about £150 / AU $ 255 ) while the 10-inch version costs $ 249.99 ( about £185 / AU $ 320 ) . The Amazon Echo Show , which features a 7-inch display , costs $ 229/£199 . Look for the new Lenovo Smart Display to go on sale early this summer . This is an interesting time in the smart speaker realm . Where once Amazon 's hold seemed secure when it came to display-packing smart speakers , Google has suddenly swooped in , and it 's not doing it alone . There are more Google Assistant smart display products to come from even more partners , so Amazon Echo Show could soon be outnumbered . Of course , that does n't guarantee victory , so we 'll have to see how the new devices stack up against Amazon 's offering .
Voice assistants are the name of the game at CES 2018 . Across the Las Vegas tech show , you ’ ll find LG TVs , Acer laptops , Asus routers , and even cars all getting bundled with Amazon ’ s Alexa assistant . But probably not many people expected a projector with native Alexa support . Enter Optoma , which TechRadar said rewrote the rules on 4K projectors with the inexpensive Optoma UHD60 last year . It 's continuing to focus on making “ accessible , mainstream ” products for customers , and now it 's releasing the UHD51A : allegedly the first projector integrated with the Alexa assistant . This 4K , UHD projector can display 2,400 lumens with a 500K:1 contrast ratio , and delivers an HDR10-quality spread of colors . Along with Alexa Smart Home , it comes equipped with a 4K UHD media player , an Android OS and two HDMI 2.0 slots that support 60fps gaming . With the UHD51A , you may not actually need an Amazon Echo or its brethren . Optoma claims the projector ’ s Alexa suite lets you “ fluidly align with speakers , screen , lighting and more ” , so it appears you can control your whole home through the projector , not just your film nights . You can expect the UHD51A by the end of March for $ 1,699 ( about £1,255 / AU $ 2,165 ) . Its brightness and contrast sit below that of the UHD60 , but considering the reduced price and voice integration , many customers will gladly accept this downgraded 4K model . As far as we can find , no other projector offers built-in voice controls ... yet . In addition , Optoma has announced several projectors that lack Alexa support , but compensate with power or mobility . The Optoma 4K UHD HDR Laser UST uses a laser light source to project 100 inches of light from just eight inches away from any wall . It comes out in the second quarter of 2018 for a whopping five grand , but Optoma is justifying the cost with a two million to one contrast ratio , HDR compatibility and a low energy footprint for such high specs . On the other end of the spectrum , Optoma ’ s LED Pocket Projector sits at 3 x 4.5 inches and 12 ounces , and can apparently play movie-length streams at decent quality before its tiny-sized battery gives out . It 'll retail for $ 279 ( about £205 / AU $ 355 ) in Q2 .
[ Update : Lenovo has stepped forward with its own smart display , fittingly called the Lenovo Smart Display . It will be available in two size options ; 8 inches and 10 inches . It , too , features Google Assistant , and can control smart home products through its display . All in all , it looks like a sleek Echo Show rival . ] In the world of smart speakers , it ’ s impossible for either of the big players , Amazon or Google , to do literally anything without the other releasing a competing product . Now Google has suggested via a blog post that it ’ s planning on taking on Amazon ’ s recently released Amazon Echo Show with some screen-equipped devices of its own . But in an unlikely twist , Google will be relying on third-parties such as JBL , Lenovo , LG and Sony to produce these ‘ smart displays ’ rather than producing them itself . In contrast , Amazon appears to only want to let third-parties produce smart speakers , while keeping the screen-equipped devices as a first-party exclusive . The JBL Link View is the first such smart speaker that 's been announced . It 's got an 8-inch HD display and a 5 megapixel front-facing camera affixed on a speaker that 's very similar in appearance to the JBL Playlist . Google ’ s smart display functionality otherwise sounds very similar to what ’ s offered by the Amazon Echo Show , including support for voice calling , and integration with Google Photos . It will also naturally support YouTube , which has been a thorn in Amazon ’ s side in recent months . Oh and Google 's blog post also seems to specifically promise that the new smart displays will be able to teach you how to cut a pineapple , which we can totally get behind . You can check out some of the smart display ’ s functionality in the short video clip below . The news shows the competition to become the dominant voice assistant is showing no signs of cooling off . Amazon appears to have the lead in terms of the amount of smart speakers sold , but subjectively it seems that Google seems to be doing better at getting other manufacturers on board , resulting in a wider range of Google Assistant-equipped speakers . But it ’ s not just speakers that are providing the battleground for this assistant war . Recently headphones have also started being equipped with either voice assistant , and televisions are also following suit . The ace up Google ’ s sleeve is of course Android , which has come equipped with Google Assistant as of Android 7.1 Nougat . If nothing else , the competition between Amazon and Google has shown the amazing power that fierce competition can have in a market . Both are desperate for their assistant to reign supreme , and in the end it 's all of us that are benefiting from their rapid development . That said , if everyone could just slow down with the new products for a couple of months that would be great . It ’ s starting to get a little exhausting .

Security company Canary has unveiled a new security camera called Canary View at Vegas electronic show CES 2018 . The Canary View is a more streamlined version of the original Canary camera , for $ 99 ( about £70 , AU $ 120 ) . The original Canary ( now being referred to as Canary All-In-One ) , was a huge Indiegogo success story , managing to secure close to 2 million dollars , 1,962 % of its original target . But it ’ s now finding itself in a market where it ’ s more expensive than many of its competitors , so it ’ s not surprising to see a cheaper model hit the market . The Canary View loses HomeHealth , an air quality sensor that frankly the camera could live without . In order to access the full range of features available on the Canary View , you ’ ll need to have a subscription to Canary Membership , which allows you to use the microphone and speaker on-board to have a conversation with someone in your house , unlimited downloads , and more . The Canary View is available to buy from the Canary website . There ’ s no indication at the moment of when the Canary View will be coming to other markets but we ’ ll let you know more when we have it . Other news from Canary during CES is the integration of Amazon devices , meaning you can request to stream footage from a Canary camera direct to your Amazon Spot , Show , and some Fire devices . There 's also a new feature for Canary 's outdoor camera called ‘ package detection ’ that uses an algorithm to identify if a package has been delivered and send you a notification . Via TechCrunch
So many books , so many words . So few eyes , so little time . Looking to help you more efficiently take on your 2018 reading challenge , Amazon has just announced Audible audiobook playback is expanding to a wider variety of its Kindle ereaders . The first generation Kindle Oasis , and the regular old Kindle , can now access Amazon 's audiobook service direct from the devices themselves , and playback content . This includes the Audible storefront , and is facilitated by connecting up to Bluetooth-enabled speakers or headphones , as neither device has a headphone jack . It 's an interesting reveal , considering only the June 2016 Kindle device previously has had any mention of Bluetooth functionality . Audible support was a key unique selling point of the 2017 Kindle Oasis , it 's worth noting . The Audible store is now the go-to stop for digital audiobook content , offering 250,000 professional audiobooks for purchase . Amazon has continued to invest in the area too , commissioning its own new readings of stories – so you can see why it 'd be keen to recoup the costs by making access to the service more widely available . You may well feel a bit miffed if you 've bought the new pricey Oasis specifically for this feature , only to find the older ones will support it too with their next software update . Still , for existing Kindle owners , you ca n't knock a top feature upgrade like this . Though neither device has previously offered this kind of audio support , Amazon has confirmed that the Bluetooth functionality was already present in each device – it 's just a matter of a software update being needed to flip its switch to `` on '' .
This year ’ s CES 2018 event has only just started but we ’ ve already witnessed some exciting surprises , the latest being Acer and Asus announcing that they 're bringing support for Amazon ’ s Alexa voice assistant to their laptops . This follows news that Amazon is making it easier to integrate Alexa into a range of different devices , while we ’ ve begun to see Alexa pop up in unexpected places . News that two major players like Asus and Acer are getting behind Alexa will be a huge boost for Amazon – and could prove uncomfortable reading for Microsoft , whose own voice assistant , Cortana , is supposed to be the go-to voice control for Windows 10 laptops . However , this may not mean the end of Cortana , as last year it was hinted that Amazon and Microsoft were looking at working together to allow their voice assistants to communicate with each other . Acer has announced that Alexa support will be coming to a select number of its laptops . These are the Aspire 5 , Aspire 7 , Spin 3 , Spin 5 , Switch 7 Black Edition , Swift 3 , Swift 5 , Swift 7 , Aspire Z24 , Aspire U27 and Aspire S24 . Some Acer Aspire all-in-one PCs will also get Alexa support . Initially available in the US , Alexa support will be available in the first quarter of 2018 via an update through the Acer Care Center software , with other locations getting Alexa support mid-2018 . Jerry Kao , President of IT Products Business of Acer Inc , stated that “ Acer is excited to be among the first brands to bring Alexa to PCs… we ’ re providing consumers the possibility to interact with multiple voice services on their notebook or desktop . ” Asus also announced that select 2018 models of its ZenBook and VivoBook laptops will support Amazon Alexa , allowing users to use their voices to control the devices . These upcoming ZenBooks and VivoBooks will be announced in the first half of 2018 , although Asus did not specify if certain markets will get Alexa support before others . We ’ ve reached out to Asus for clarification . Steve Chang , President of Asus North America , said that “ combining Alexa with Asus PCs will allow customers to complete a variety of formerly complex tasks , simply by speaking . This allows customers greater efficiency and allows them to spend more time on their own passions ” . Hopefully we ’ ll get our hands on these new Acer and Asus laptops soon to test out how well Alexa works on Windows laptops .

Amazon is determined to get its Alexa voice assistant onto as many devices as possible . Only one day after it announced that it had released tools for developers who want to add Alexa support to ovens and microwaves , Amazon has today announced that 's it 's working on a development kit aimed at bringing Alexa to `` mobile accessories . '' Sound familiar ? We 've already seen Alexa-powered wearables in the form of devices like the CoWatch , but this effort marks the first time that Amazon itself is handling the bulk of the code necessary for bringing the voice service to smaller devices . As such ( or so we should hope ) , the service should be more stable than what we 'd see from a third-party developer . In some ways , though , Amazon 's kit is n't quite as ambitious as what we saw in the CoWatch , considering that you 'll need to have your device tethered to a smartphone in order for Alexa to work . The idea behind the kit is thus a little like what we see in the first generations of the Apple Watch , which need to be tethered to an iPhone . You lose some convenience in the process , but it gets rid of a ton of technical hurdles and so frees developers to bring Alexa to comparatively inexpensive and lightweight devices . In essence , all the watch , headphone set or fitness tracker would need to do is connect to the Alexa app on iOS or Android over a Bluetooth connection . Unlike the oven and microwave kit — which is already available — Amazon 's `` mobile accessory '' kit wo n't be open to a wide pool of developers until sometime later this year . Even so , companies like Bose , Beyerdynamic , Jambra and iHome are reportedly already working on devices that will be compatible with the kit , so it 's possible we 'll see one of the resulting devices before 2019 rolls around .
Voice-controlled devices continue to grow more impressive by the week , and in the latest development , today Amazon announced that its Alexa voice assistant service will soon be able to help out in the kitchen . Specifically , when you need to have something heated in the microwave or oven in the future , you could simply say , `` Alexa , heat this on high for one minute . '' In addition , you could ask Alexa to preheat the oven to 450 degrees . The tools are available from Amazon for developers now , but we 'll still have to wait a while to see compatible appliances . The catch , as you might imagine , is that your ovens and microwaves need to support this feature , and almost all `` smart '' versions currently do n't . They 'll either need to be updated or built from scratch entirely . Ovens and microwaves are the current focus , but Amazon hopes that other appliances will be compatible beyond that . Only Whirlpool has officially made an Alexa skill for ovens and microwaves at the moment , but we have no timeline as to when we 'll actually see an Alexa-capable oven or microwave from the company aside from `` soon . '' In the future , though , Samsung , LG , GE Appliances and Kenmore will also allow their ovens ( and , in time , other appliances ) to support Alexa . The feature seems especially useful if you 're in a busy kitchen with your hands full . It also might be useful for when you 've put your food in the microwave and are reading the back of the box for directions , which you can then call out to Alexa as you find them . Then again , for more familiar items , it 's worth wondering if voice commands will truly be that much more efficient . Even with current technology , it 's generally already quicker to set an oven or microwave by hand than it is to call out directions .

Would you let Amazon dress you ? It 's an idea that the company does n't seem to want to let go of . After launching the eyebrow-raising Amazon Echo Look camera , which took photos of a user before offering fashion advice , a new patent has been uncovered which shows Amazon considering a similar concept within a smart , mixed-reality mirror . It describes a mirror equipped with cameras , projectors and reflective and transmissive display panels to mix the experience of a regular mirror with one capable of augmented reality overlays . So , you could sidle up in front of the mirror , and check out what an outfit would look like on you , projected over your image in a form-fitting way , without first having to buy the item . A virtual model would be created , tracking your eyes and face , merged between the two panels in as natural a mirror-like experience as possible . Presumably , it 'd be tied to some form of Amazon retail system , letting users buy `` the look '' being trialled , too . In addition , the mirror could recreate different scenes , letting you know how your outfit would go down in different real-world environments . The example given puts the wannabe-fashionista on a digital beach . As ever with a patent , it 's not necessarily a sure-fire sign that this product will ever come to market . But there 's loads of evidence that Amazon thinks this could be its way into the lucrative world of fashion . It 's already launched its own fashion label , which the Look was playing into , even if that gadget 's buzz died very quickly after its reveal . Amazon also bought New York 's Body Labs team late last year , which creates 3D avatars for gaming and clothing modelling . It sits squarely right next to what Amazon appears to be looking to achieve with this patent product .

To understand just how powerful Amazon and Netflix became in 2017 , you have to look at what happened at the year ’ s close . In December , Disney , a bellowing freight train of a media company , made yet another stop to pick up Fox and its $ 52 billion assets . Buying Fox has meant it has acquired a new portion of Marvel characters to sustain the MCU for years to come , bought its way into UK homes with a chunk of BSkyB now under its wing , and became a majority shareholder in Hulu - a streaming service that ’ s yet to make its way out of the US but has served up fantastic fare , with the likes of The Handmaid ’ s Tale on its books . That last point is very important as it fits nicely with Disney ’ s previous bold assertion that it plans to make its own streaming service , for its animated arsenal and expanding Star Wars galaxy . It ’ s doing this to do what it can to stop the two-horse streaming race . Because that ’ s exactly what streaming is in 2017 , with both Netflix and Amazon parading a distribution method that ’ s happy to upturn the stuffy Hollywood ways of old and put its money where its mouth is . It ’ s got everyone worried - from distributors to theater owners - and for good reason . Netflix and Amazon are starting to act more like a studio , while the rest of the world ’ s studios are acting more like Netflix and Amazon . Where once they were seen as services that hid their lack of quality content through clever algorithms that promoted a handful of good things to watch , both are now serving up homemade award winners . The Amazon Studios-funded Manchester By The Sea brought a brace of Oscars and a Golden Globe win in 2017 ; The Crown rightly deserved two Golden Globes for Netflix - then there ’ s the 91 Emmy nominations it garnered . Four years ago , Netflix found itself with just 14 . Where once Netflix and Amazon were seen as the plucky underdogs with limited ambition , they are now beating the rest to Prime fodder , have real scope and in Netflix 's case over 100 million subscribers . Take Amazon for instance : it bet $ 1 billion on the rights to the Lord of the Rings TV franchise in 2017 , outbidding HBO and ( surprise , surprise ) Netflix . In 2018 , Netflix will be going for breadth with 80 original films in production . That ’ s almost two releases a week , not even taking into account the TV shows it is set to make . The scope and scale of these two companies is simply unprecedented in Hollywood . Netflix isn ’ t too bothered about budget , either . Martin Scorsese ’ s The Irishman is set to cost over $ 100 million and recent original movie Bright - starring the not-cheap Will Smith - reportedly cost $ 90 million . Despite lukewarm critical reviews , Bright has proved that Netflix ’ s original push is working . Although Netflix is always coy about numbers , metrics firm Nielsen reckons that around 11 million people in the US streamed Bright over its opening weekend which should make Netflix will be extremely happy . And happier still that this was bettered by the second season of Stranger Things . The problem is , Netflix needs more Brights and Stranger Things , many more , if it ’ s truly going to succeed , as does Amazon . Those cogs clicking into place for Disney could prove the undoing of the two current streaming giants in 2018 and beyond . Disney already revealed that it is to take its content away from Netflix when the current contract is up , which leaves a massive Mouse-shaped hole to fill . Netflix is choosing to fill this hole up with original movies , shows and lots of them . This is the strange place the streaming world finds itself right now . Netflix and Amazon are starting to act more like a studio , while the rest of the world ’ s studios are clambering to act more like Netflix and Amazon . This , for both parties , is a huge gamble . For every Stranger Things-sized hit , Netflix has expensive flops like Marco Polo . Amazon has had much critical success with Transparent and Red Oaks but it ’ s not had as much success as Netflix . Even with its Amazon Original Series pilot program acting as a great testbed for new things , paying an ( albeit unconfirmed ) $ 80 million for Woody Allen ’ s forgettable Crisis in Six Scenes , scrapping the much-hyped Z : The Beginning of Everything after one season and paying well over the odds for The Grand Tour , regardless of the strange draw middle-age men doing silly things with cars has , has meant that Amazon has had to have a rethink - hence going big on the Lord of the Rings rights . Netflix and Amazon and their refreshing distribution model is here to stay but expect a shift to happen in 2018 . Netflix spent a cool $ 6 billion on original content in 2017 ( a number set to rise to $ 8 billion in 2018 ) and a billion promoting that content . But hardly any of that money was spent in pushing its original movies at the beginning of their launch window . Unlike a theatrical release which is advertised through massive billboards , boundless TV activity and the like , Netflix ’ s new content lands on the site with very little fanfare . Bright proves that this risky way to release is the right way . But as more original movies land , Netflix has surely got to start figuring out a way to promote these as what they are : tent poles on which its success will surely rely . Just letting them suddenly appear on the site ( its TV shows not so much but it ’ s films are given short shrift ) without a systematic campaign to back them up will surely end in disaster . Disney could prove the undoing of the two current streaming giants in 2018 and beyond . Netflix itself rates this new content enough to put up the prices of its service in 2017 , explaining in an email to its users that the price rise means it “ can add more of what you like to watch . Awesome entertainment built around you is what we ’ re all about. ” So , it better make sure those films are looked after . Prime Video is still finding its feet as a streaming service and burying it within Prime hasn ’ t helped it stand out . But it has had a lot of positives in 2017 . Big movies such as Arrival , Moonlight and Spotlight all came to the service early but again with little fanfare . Expect this to change in 2018 with the spectre of Disney ’ s Fox buyout looming large on the horizon - both Amazon and Netflix will be shouting about their wares to make sure they don ’ t lose their subscribers . 2018 will be the year of original content . Amazon and Netflix know this , but now so does Apple , so does Disney and so does Hulu . We already know Netflix and Amazon are looking to do it bigger but it will be the one that does it better that will truly win out .

Amazon has bought Ring , a smart home tech company that makes video doorbells and other security devices . The acquisition , first reported by GeekWire , gives Amazon yet another way into your house . The terms of the agreement have n't yet been disclosed , though reports pin the acquisition price at more than $ 1 billion . As when it bought Twitch in 2014 , Amazon is expected to keep Ring running as-is , meaning the brand and its products are sticking around . Amazon will , however , integrate Ring 's technologies into other products and services where it makes sense . `` Ring is committed to our mission to reduce crime in neighborhoods by providing effective yet affordable home security tools to our Neighbors that make a positive impact on our homes , our communities , and the world , '' a Ring spokesperson said in a statement to TechRadar . `` We 'll be able to achieve even more by partnering with an inventive , customer-centric company like Amazon . We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods . '' Ring fits well into Amazon 's smart home vertical , led by the Amazon Echo smart speaker line . Amazon also has a security camera , the Cloud Cam , and a service called Amazon Key . Amazon Key caused a stir when it was announced as it gives couriers access to your home to drop off packages when you 're not there . It still has its detractors . Amazon 's push into our homes is n't limited to its own products and services , of course . Its Alexa assistant has crossed over to numerous third-party smart home devices , including some built by Ring . In June 2017 , Ring announced that select Ring Video Doorbells and Security Cameras could be accessed by talking to an Amazon Echo Show or Amazon Fire TV . Speaking to today 's announcement , an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement : `` Ring 's home security products and services have delighted customers since day one . We 're excited to work with this talented team and help them in their mission to keep homes safe and secure . '' Ring is n't the first smart doorbell company Amazon has purchased , either . In December , Amazon bought Blink , a startup that makes wireless video doorbells and security cameras . With yet another video doorbell company under its belt , Google , Amazon 's chief rival in the smart home space , is likely looking on with interest . The search giant recently brought smart cam company Nest back under its wing , and the two are poised to develop more ways to integrate the Google voice assistant , Google Assistant , into more products . Which will emerge as our favorite supplier of smart home products , Amazon or Google ? The answer is n't clear yet , but these two are taking the fight right to your doorstep .
Do you have a sneaking suspicion that your neighbors are piggybacking on your Wi-Fi , or that your kid is staying up until 3 am watching Minecraft videos ? With the right network router , you can ask Amazon 's Alexa to investigate and block unfamiliar devices from your network , all through voice commands . At MWC 2018 today , McAfee announced the development of a new Alexa Skill , which lets you check on the security of your network and router without having to open an app . Here are some examples : So , through Alexa , you ’ ll be able to set a time limit on your kid ’ s iPad , or scan for botnet attacks or vulnerable devices . All routers with McAfee Secure Home Platform will be automatically updated with Alexa functionality . This platform , which was announced at CES 2018 , lets you extend your desktop security scans across all network-connected devices , including smart home devices . These voice commands aren ’ t available yet ; once they are , you ’ ll have to go to Amazon ’ s Skills page and download them to your Amazon smart speaker of choice . If you don ’ t have an Amazon Echo or other Amazon speaker , don ’ t worry . Gary Davis , Chief Consumer Security Evangelist at McAfee , told PCMag that if Alexa proves popular with McAfee ’ s customers , the company will also develop support for other voice assistants like Google Assistant or Apple 's Siri . As we saw just recently with Amazon ’ s smart lock fiasco , smart home devices can be particularly vulnerable to hacking if not properly monitored . One of the biggest steps we outlined for securing your Wi-Fi network from hackers is using a monitoring app ( like McAfee ’ s ) to check for intruding devices . But logging into an app to check your list of connected smart phones , consoles , computers and so on every week probably seems like too much of a hassle to most people . Complacency can leave our networks exposed . That ’ s why McAfee ’ s executive VP John Giamatteo said in a press release the company 's security solutions “ must fit seamlessly into the way they already live their lives ” via voice commands . With this new tech , we can be lazy and still be secure . MWC ( Mobile World Congress ) is the world 's largest exhibition for the mobile industry , stuffed full of the newest phones , tablets , wearables and more . TechRadar is reporting live from Barcelona all week to bring you the very latest from the show floor . Head to our dedicated MWC 2018 hub to see all the new releases , along with TechRadar 's world-class analysis and buying advice about your next phone .

Update : Several months after augmented reality ( AR ) shopping came to Amazon 's iOS app , the online giant has now added the feature to the Android version . Amazon 's AR View lets shoppers place a digital render of a product in their home to see what it will look like before they buy it . To access AR View , you 'll first need to download the AR Core app , according to ZDNet , then head to the Amazon app 's camera icon to start placing things like AR futons in your living room . If you decide to do a little scouting in AR before making your purchase , you 'll have 15,000 items to test out , from couches to cribs . Not too shabby for a still-nascent mobile technology . Original article continues below ... Augmented reality ( AR ) is about to make shopping online for furniture a heck of a lot easier . As of today , you 'll find a new feature called AR View in Amazon 's iOS app that lets you see what big items like desks and entertainment systems will look like in your home before you buy them . In Amazon 's own words in its patch notes , this applies to everything from furniture and speakers to coffeemakers . To use it , simply click on the camera icon next to the app 's search bar and then click on AR View , and you 'll see a list of products that you can virtually place within your house . Unfortunately , this is the only way it appears to work at the moment . I tried to access AR View in reverse by going to my wish list and choosing furniture from there , but there were no links on the landing pages for seeing my prairie-style lamps in AR View . And , in fact , far fewer items appear to be available for AR View than the talk of `` thousands '' of items that I 'm seeing elsewhere would suggest , as it took me only a couple of seconds to scroll through all the furniture listed in the `` Living Room '' section . Maybe I 'm missing something , but right now the selection is closer to `` dozens . '' Naturally , under `` Electronics , '' Amazon 's Echo devices take center stage . But AR View works well with the relatively few items currently on offer . Just allow the app to find a flat surface ( which was kind of a struggle for me with my white tile floor and white walls ) , tap the screen , and then – poof – the chair or bookcase appears in your house through the camera view . You can also rotate objects by holding down two fingers on the screen , or you can resize them as needed . Unfortunately , that means you 'll have to know how big the object really is before you buy it . In other words , that bookcase you want to buy might have looked really lovely when you resized it to take up half the wall inside the app , but you 'll be in for a rude surprise when its real-life counterpart shows up and takes up only half the space . At least it 's easy to buy items . If you decide you like how the item looks , you just need to click on a menu at the top right of the AR View interface in order to go to the store page . For now , it largely appears to be a neat side feature that should become more useful as more interactive objects get added . The feature is currently only available for the iPhone 6S and higher , and the device needs to be running iOS 11 . It 's also not the first time we 've seen an app like this , as IKEA rolled out an AR feature earlier this year , but the massive product selection available through Amazon make this a feature to keep your eyes on .

Amazon ’ s sudden move into AI chip development suggests they want to make your conversations with Alexa as delay-free as possible . As first reported by The Information , Amazon plans to create proprietary AI chips and place them in its Amazon Echo , Amazon Dot , and every other speaker in their lineup . This will allow your new device to handle speech recognition and data processing locally instead of shipping it off to the cloud first . Right now , whenever you ask Alexa about the weather , she doesn ’ t know what you ’ re asking ; she just transcribes the words into data and sends that data to the cloud for information . With integrated chip software , Alexa would hear and understand your question – maybe even remember you asking it before – and could look up the forecast without needing to send data to and from Amazon ’ s remote servers . With over 400 employees with AI chip expertise , Amazon hopes they ’ ll be able to improve response time to your questions , as well as improve the quality of responses overall . The Information speculates that these chips could even help prevent your Alexa data from being hacked , and the chip could help Alexa stay functional if Amazon ’ s cloud ever goes offline . Amazon used to rely on Intel and Nvidia for its processor chips ( we called Nvidia an “ AI and graphics card titan ” last year ) . Now , with Amazon deciding to strike out on its own for Alexa , Nvidia and Intel might be running out of companies to sell their AI chips to : Google , Apple and Samsung all rely on first-party AI chips for their devices . Google ’ s Tensor Processing Unit chips are what power DeepMind , its AI program designed to “ learn like a human ” by recalling previously learned skills and connections between ideas . In Amazon ’ s quest to give Alexa a more “ human ” response time , these AI chips will likely focus of speech-based connections : linking the words you say to the thing you most likely want answered or purchased , without needing to consult huge amounts of cloud data to infer the answer . We don ’ t know how long it will take for Amazon to develop and integrate these chips , but we ’ re excited about the implications . Voice assistants like Alexa dominated CES this year : dozens of companies integrated their devices into Amazon ’ s voice-assisted network . If controlling your devices get even faster than before , then a truly “ smart ” home doesn ’ t seem too far out of reach .
If you ’ ve been holding out for a 12-inch Apple MacBook but refuse to pay full price for it , today is your lucky day . We ’ ve found that Amazon is selling 2016 ( not refurbished ) MacBooks for as much as 23 % off as a Deal of the Day . Score an unopened 2016 Apple MacBook for just $ 999 on Amazon Regularly $ 1,299 if you were to buy the 2018 version , this 2016 MacBook comes with a whopping 512GB worth of SSD storage and 8GB of memory – all with a Woot 1-year warranty in case that keyboard runs into problems.View Deal According to Amazon , these MacBook models – of which there are two others on sale – “ were originally intended as warranty replacements , and held by Apple to support their customers . ” Woot somehow got a hold of them and now they ’ re available at a $ 300 discount . These laptops come with a 1-year Woot warranty , which should cover our only complaint with the older MacBooks : the shallow keyboard that has been reported to lose keys – though it was a rare occurrence . Not to be outdone by its arch rival , Huawei has placed its latest MateBook laptops on sale , namely the 12-inch Huawei MateBook X. It ’ s a good thing , then , that we really enjoyed this laptop in our full review . Nab the Huawei MateBook X for just $ 785 on Amazon This direct retort to Apple ’ s MacBook runs Windows 10 with a 256GB SSD and 8GB of memory powered by an Intel 7th-gen Core i7 processor behind a gorgeous 2K display for $ 341 off the list price.View Deal This Windows alternative to the MacBook deal above is going for about the same time . With this awfully similar laptop , you ’ re getting half as much storage space but a more powerful processor for $ 214 less – a pretty good trade off if we do say so ourselves

Amazon is planning to take even more control over the journey your purchased products take to your door , according to reports – the giant retail and tech company is said to be plotting to launch its own full-scale delivery service at some point during 2018 . The Wall Street Journal says the new service will take on the likes of UPS and FedEx by picking up packages from businesses who sell on its site and delivering them to customers . It 's not the first time such a rumor has surfaced , but it seems Amazon is now ready to start putting the plan into practice , starting with a limited roll out . Apparently the scheme has already begun operating in London , and will arrive in Los Angeles next . It follows on from the service Amazon already offers of delivering products for companies that store goods in Amazon warehouses en route to customers . Shipping With Amazon , or SWA , as the service is said to be called , will give Amazon full control over pretty much every step of the process of getting goods from A to B , whether or not they pass through its warehouses . As yet there 's nothing official from the company itself but we know Amazon is keen on making the delivery process as smooth as possible . Jeff Bezos and his team are already way down the line in testing drone deliveries , and there are also plans afoot to bring boxes to your front door with the help of self-driving cars . For customers , not much will really change – you 'll still click through to confirm your purchase on the Amazon site and get whatever it is you 've bought turn up at your home – but it 's another step forward in Amazon 's bid to control every aspect of its deliveries .

The best part of Amazon ’ s US-exclusive Prime Exclusive phones program ? It ’ s the cheapest way to get your hands on a wide array of excellent Android smartphones , like the LG G6 , Moto X4 and more – fully unlocked . The worst part of it , though , is the baked-in lock screen offers and ads . But starting tomorrow , it ’ s going to be a lot harder to complain since Amazon will be issuing a software update to all phones that it sells to remove those advertisements . Why the change of course ? Well , it just wants consumers to get more use and enjoyment out of their smartphones . Specifically , Amazon notes that removing lock screen ads and offers will allow customers to personalize their lock screens and get better use out of phones that employ biometric measures like face recognition and fingerprint sensors . The removal of the lock screen ads and offers is a good move , but what ’ s not changing is the folder of pre-installed applications , including Prime Video , Prime Music , Prime Photos and Amazon ’ s deal widget . Ideally , these phones wouldn ’ t come with any pre-installed apps , but at least these will be helpful to those deeply embedded in Amazon ’ s ecosystem .

Update : Amazon has responded to claims that the security of its Amazon Key smart lock system can be compromised . Speaking specifically of the steps Amazon takes to protect a customer , an Amazon spokesperson said : `` The delivery driver must complete all steps of the in-home delivery on her/his handheld system to move to the next delivery , including physically checking to ensure that the door is locked . `` During a delivery , the customer can see time stamps regarding how long the door is open and Amazon receives an alert if the door is unlocked for more than several minutes . In the extremely rare case Amazon is unable to lock the door after a delivery , we immediately call the customer . '' The original story continues below . There 's no denying that it 's an annoyance to miss a delivery – especially one that 's been fast tracked by the premium Amazon Prime service you 've paid for . But it 'd be a whole lot more annoying if a desire for a speedy delivery led to your home being robbed instead . That 's what 's alleged to be a potential hazard of using one of the new Amazon Key security systems . To avoid missed deliveries , the web-connected smart lock gives delivery workers temporary access to your property , allowing them to leave your parcel safely indoors without you being present . An included Wi-Fi camera acts as a deterrent for any light-fingered delivery person who may want to make off with your personal items . However , the integrity of the security system has been called into question by a hacker who has shown that it 's possible to manipulate the system so as to give anyone access to an Amazon Key-protected property . I call this the `` Break & Enter dropbox '' and it pairs well with my Amazon Key ( smartlock & smartcam combo ) . It 's all current software . Amazon downplayed the last attack on this product because it needed an evil delivery driver to execute . This does n't . pic.twitter.com/35krz46KabFebruary 4 , 2018 A hacker known online as `` MG '' posted the above clip , showing the Amazon Key 's security protocols being overriden in a controlled situation . Though MG is withholding the details of how his hack works until Amazon has had an opportunity to address the issue , the video shows the Amazon Key 's lock potentially remaining open even when a delivery driver 's access allowance has expired . It appears to take advantage of what 's called a `` dropbox '' – a mobile computer with Wi-Fi connectivity , which can control the key , either finding a way to prevent it from re-locking itself , or simply unlocking it itself .

Not satisfied with being the biggest online retailer on the planet , Amazon has its sights set on a new product for a new demographic : checking accounts for teens . Sources speaking with Bloomberg say Amazon is in early talks with banks about offering a checking account-like product to those too young to open one at a traditional bank without their parents ' permission . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 Amazon apparently plans to aim the accounts squarely at teens , having it appeal to that age group as well as people who do n't have a credit card . Amazon Alexa could also feature in the product , further appealing to teens who are growing up with voice assistants . Amazon has already waded into the financial service waters with Amazon Cash , which lets shoppers add physical cash to their Amazon account by visiting brick-and-mortar stores . The new checking account product would be more streamlined than this , and offer an alternative to those who do n't have bank accounts to begin with . One issue Amazon could run into is that teens prefer going to physical stores rather than shopping online . The age-old tradition of hanging out at the mall with your friends apparently has n't faded in the digital age . An additional concern we see is the issue of privacy . Amazon would have access to a lot of personal information about young people before they turn 18 , including , of course , their spending habits . This would be good for Amazon 's business , but raises the question of how much information we turn over to tech companies in the name of convenience . There 's no word yet on when Amazon 's checking accounts would go live , but we 'll keep you posted .

Image credit : Adition Smart speakers may be incredibly useful for our daily lives , but in terms of decor , let ’ s be honest : they ’ re basically dark , cylindrical paperweights that you probably keep in a corner . Read more : I-box Century review For people looking for a speaker that won ’ t stick out like a sore thumb , the Adition Lamp Speaker – an LED lamp equipped with speakers and Alexa support – could be Amazon ’ s fashionable alternative to the norm . In a blog post , Alexa Business Development Principal Mariel van Tatenhove announced that Amazon has partnered with various Original Design Manufacturers ( ODMs ) to create “ white-box solutions ” , or design templates from which manufacturers can create their own Alexa-enabled speakers . The Adition Lamp is one such template . “ We envision a world where Alexa is everywhere , accessible through any connected device , ” van Tatenhove said . We ca n't confirm if Alexa cackled in the background at this statement . As currently envisioned , the six-inch Adition comes with two two-inch speakers , two microphones , and button controls for volume and dimming , with dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity and iOS/Android-compatible Alexa app support . But , again , companies willing to lease the ODM design would then add their own spin on it , so their Alexa lamps could have different features and dimensions . Van Tatenhove ’ s post also revealed two white-box designs for standard tabletop smart speakers with Alexa support , but they don ’ t necessarily stand out from other speakers in a very crowded market , compared to this new smart lamp design . As we learned at CES this year , enabling Alexa and Google Assistant support is trending . From cars to the smart speakers of competitors , Amazon and Google want people using these voice assistants as their primary source of information and the way they make purchases . Most Alexa speakers , like the Ultimate Ears Megablast or Asus Lyra Voice , have designs separate from Amazon , or lease designs from other manufacturers like Qualcomm . But these speakers ' Alexa support is often limited compared to what you ’ ll find from an Amazon Echo . By making white-box designs with native Alexa support available , Amazon is no doubt hoping manufacturers will come straight to the source and rehabilitate Alexa ’ s image . Ultimately , we ’ re excited about the potential for a flood of new smart lamp speakers onto the market . So far , only one such device is available : the GE Sol smart lamp , powered by Alexa voice support . Its unique circular design outshines the Adition ’ s , but its Alexa support likely can ’ t hold a candle to a first-party device . Via The Verge

Amazon and Google are upping their street cred with audiophiles , with the companies offering Tidal high resolution music streaming through their respective Amazon Fire TV and Android Auto platforms . The new app , which still offers Tidal 's signature lossless audio , is the perfect fit for the devices , as soundbars and in-car speakers tend to be the best audio output devices for many households . Read more : Amazon Echo Link Amp Tidal for Amazon Fire TV has also been tailored to fit the big screen format rather than its mobile standard , with a library of high quality recordings that should complement Amazon 's own Prime Music offering . Barring the exclusion of video content for the in-car version for obvious safety reasons , it 's the same Tidal experience that audiophiles have come to love , reworked for new platforms . However , Tidal has continued to struggle in the face of stiff competition . Facing off against the established Spotify and growing threat of Apple Music , some controversial press surrounding the service and the higher monthly subscription to access the higher quality recordings has left its library of 50 million tracks less heard than its founder Jay-Z would have liked .

Amazon would probably like to just parachute packages to you from a safe distance . But the company 's latest patent suggests it thinks it might be safer to just fly drones directly in front of customers instead of risking broken Amazon Fire tablets ( or concussions ) . To potentially aid in this , the retail giant has filed a patent for a package delivery drone with a sensor system for registering both “ visible “ and “ audible “ gestures . Drones will communicate with a gesture database that will help it to recognize what you ’ re trying to get it to do , like 'Fly over there ! ' or 'Back off ! ' Read more : Amazon Echo Dot ( 3rd Generation ) Ironically , the patent image , first discovered by GeekWire , looks more like a man screaming and flailing in terror as a drone descends . But the patent itself hints at some complex technology to prevent accidents . The patent indicates that the drone could be equipped with visible and infrared light cameras , depth sensors , motion scanners , and input and output microphones and noise filters for sound . With these sensors , the theoretical drone will be able to recognize gestures and “ adjust its trajectory and/or speed “ based on your instructions . And to ensure that some random person on the sidewalk doesn ’ t disrupt your delivery , the drone could have the ability to “ verify an identity of the human user prior to instructing the retaining system to implement the behavior adjustment. “ It would do this by by using the cameras to compare your appearance to that of the Amazon account owner or purchaser – or by receiving confirmation from a user 's device ( like a smartphone confirmation code ) . The listing also suggests that the gesture database could store new , unique gestures it sees from users , and remember how to respond to them for future deliveries . Whether or not you think that 's a helpful service feature or a dystopian invasion of privacy probably depends on whether you think it ’ s a good or bad idea to have a smart speaker that recognizes your voice in your home . Amazon isn ’ t the first to think up this kind of technology . The DJI Spark added PalmControl functionality , which lets you control your Spark with hand motions and instruct it to perform actions , like take an air-selfie . But Spark users choose to have drone flying around their heads . Amazon has to account for people who might be inclined to treat the aircraft as hostile , and program the fliers to know how to respond to hostile gestures , as well as directional ones . Like all patents , this is no guarantee that the feature will be implemented in Amazon ’ s final delivery service . Amazon has also patented a self-destruct feature to vaporize drones in the air rather than risk them landing on passersby . But another patent spotted by GeekWire last year lends credence to the notion that Amazon wants the delivery drones up close and personal with customers . This patent , focused on speech interaction , described how drones would “ produce speech in order to warn or instruct ” customers away . Amazon also suggested the drones could have “ automatic speech recognition ( ASR ) and natural language understanding ( NLU ) capabilities ” , which strongly suggests the drone would have built-in Alexa functionality for its “ two-directional speech dialog ” with customers . While the drone could also connect the customer with an Amazon “ support representative ” , the patent suggests this is more of a last resort . The latest patent , which says the drone could respond to “ audible gestures ” , could easily be linked with an Alexa-based audible response program . But we ’ ll have to wait and see whether either ( or both ) of these patented designs make it into Amazon ’ s final drone model . Via The Verge

With each passing day , Amazon becomes more and more of a video game company . Two years ago that trip into the world of pixels and cell shaders took the world ’ s largest retailer into the game development space with a game called Breakaway , and last year ’ s big play included the acquisition of game streaming juggernaut Twitch . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 Today Amazon announced its next big leap in video games : competitive gaming – specifically , a new competitive gaming service called GameOn . GameOn will integrate with some mobile titles you already know and play to offer you real-world rewards from the Amazon Store . ( Think eSports rewards but for the people who can only invest a few hours in a game each week rather than a few dozen . ) Amazon ’ s GameOn currently supports leaderboards , leagues and multi-round competitions and , for games with an engaged community , can also enable players and streamers to create their own user-generated competitions and invite participants to join in on the competition . Some studios that have already signed onto the service include nWay , Game Insight and Millennial Esports ’ Eden Games , with more en route . When it goes into full effect , Amazon ’ s GameOn service will be great for gamers – as it rewards you with goods from Amazon for the games you ’ re already playing – but it does require that developers sign on with the service , a potentially costly endeavor as Amazon plans on charging $ 0.003 per play . Amazon has not yet announced what prizes it will make available to gamers who participate in these tournaments but , considering the breadth of the Amazon Store , it ’ s certainly not lacking in the prize department .
Expect to see more 'buy ' buttons in your Google searches in the near future , as the search company is teaming up with major retailers to better compete with Amazon . According to Reuters , Google is teaming up with Target , Walmart , Home Depot , Costco and Ultra . In this partnership , Google plans to catalog each retailer ’ s online wares and display alongside any searches for a particular product . Read more : Google Pixel 3 review While the company already produces links to established retailers and has had a section dedicated to shopping for quite some time , this seems to be a more direct purchasing experience . Late last year , around Black Friday , we saw the search company introduced a new Google Express landing page and product listings complete with dedicated purchase buttons and a checkout experience all without having to leave the search engine for another website . Google is also likely assembling the supergroup of retailers to better compete with Amazon Alexa . As it stands , you can ’ t ask Google Assistant to buy a giant pack of toilet paper or a Google Pixel 2 as you can with Alexa , and that ’ s a giant pool of users the search company is likely tired of missing out on . Furthermore , the report suggest Google only began looking into the project after seeing that tens of millions of its users were searching for images of products or entering queries of where they could purchase it .

Ever feel that Amazon 's Alexa voice assistant can be a bit too chatty for its own good ? A new mode in testing could help the digital helper bite its tongue at appropriate moments on your Amazon Echo device . Some Reddit users ( as reported by AFTV News ) are being offered a new beta `` Brief Mode '' to try in the Alexa app . This replaces spoken responses for simple beeps when some tasks have been completed . Read more : Amazon Echo Link Amp So , for instance , were you to ask Alexa to turn on some smart lights , you 'd be given the option of having Alexa beep affirmatively rather than speak . It 's only a small tweak , but it could make that sense of an omnipresent Amazon spy in your home feel a little less overbearing , and there 's plenty of potential for expansion . While Amazon is keeping it simple at present , an expanded Brief Mode could cut down on things like timer explanations and unavailable music streaming songs . Sure , it 'd be a little less personal , but perhaps also a bit more useful . There 's no word yet on when or if Brief Mode will roll out to all users , but we 'll keep you posted .

Splinter Cell may be a stealth video game series but its next possible release is anything but at the moment . On Amazon Canada a listing appeared recently for Splinter Cell 2018 and though it ’ s since been taken down an eagle-eyed Redditor spotted it and a screenshot lives on . Though the listing didn ’ t have images , release date , or synopsis , the item model number on the site included E3 which suggests this is when the game will first be announced . Read more : Far Cry New Dawn Given that we don ’ t actually have any confirmation a Splinter Cell game is coming this year and it ’ s possible Amazon could have been putting up the listing as some kind of placeholder ( an oddly specific choice though Splinter Cell may be ) this remains a rumor for now . However , it does tie in neatly with previous rumors that the series would be returning this year . Back in 2016 there were rumors that Sam Fisher ’ s voice actor , Michael Ironside , was back at Ubisoft working on an unconfirmed project . Then , in 2017 Ubisoft ’ s CEO was quite clear during E3 that the publisher hadn ’ t forgotten the series . Outside of these rumors , the time just feels right – the last Splinter Cell game was released all the way back in 2013 at the tail end of the previous generation and Ghost Recon Wildlands is continuing to do well for Ubisoft . We ’ d say it ’ s about time the Splinter Cell side of the Tom Clancy brand made its way onto PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles .
Been looking painfully at that heavy , untouched copy of War and Peace , but just ca n't bring yourself to lug it around with you for the next six months ? If you 're the owner of an Amazon Echo , there may be an alternative for you . Amazon , which also owns audiobook company Audible , is letting owners of its Echo speakers listen to one audiobook of their choosing for free through the smart device . You can pick any book currently on the Audible service and have the Echo read it aloud for you in its entirety – providing you 've not already previously subscribed to the service or used another taster offer for the listen-a-long app . If you 're not particularly bookish , Amazon will let the Echo pick a popular new book for you , letting you get up to date with the latest bestseller that everyone 's talking about . For Amazon , its dominance in the audiobook space is about to be tested by Google , which has just started selling audiobooks on its Play store , ready to be paired with a Google Assistant speaker . Should you want to keep up with Audible after you 've given that first free book a go , there 's a monthly subscription fee of £7.99 / $ 14.95 .

Today in 'totally creepy tech , ' Amazon 's Alexa voice assistant is laughing at users . And no , we 're not talking a playful giggle after it 's been asked it to do something ( which would still be weird ) . We 're talking an unprompted cackle that 's downright unsettling . You can hear it for yourself in this tweet from late February . So Alexa decided to laugh randomly while I was in the kitchen . Freaked @ SnootyJuicer and I out . I thought a kid was laughing behind me . pic.twitter.com/6dblzkiQHpFebruary 23 , 2018 Folks elsewhere on Reddit and Twitter are reporting that Alexa on devices like the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot utters a loud laugh out of nowhere , or in response to a typical command , like turning off the lights . In some cases , Alexa has refused to perform the task , making the situation all the more terrifying . Amazon said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that it knows about Alexa 's unprompted guffaws . `` We 're aware of this and working to fix it , '' the company 's statement read . On follow-up , an Amazon spokesperson told TechRadar in an email that , `` In rare circumstances , Alexa can mistakenly hear the phrase 'Alexa , laugh . ' '' To address this particular issue , Amazon is changing the prompt to 'Alexa , can you laugh ? ' , which is less likely to produce false positives , or instances when Alexa thinks you 're asking it to laugh , but you really are n't . Amazon is also disabling the 'Alexa , laugh ' prompt . Finally , Amazon will now have Alexa first say , 'Sure , I can laugh , ' followed by laughter , rather than going straight into laughter . Still , this does n't explain the instances when Alexa laughs when seemingly no one is talking . We 've asked Amazon for more on this glitch . so my mom & I are just sitting in the living room , neither of us said a word & our Alexa lit up and laughed for no reason . she didn ’ t even say anything , just laughed . we unplugged her.March 5 , 2018 Needless to say , having a device laugh at you unprovoked is ... frightening . Beyond simply being scary , there 's already a level of invasion with having a device like the Amazon Echo or Google Home in your house , or other products with sensors and microphones , like TVs . We trade-off the convenience of being able to speak voice commands to these machines , or have them anticipate our needs seemingly through osmosis , by giving up some level of privacy . With Alexa laughing at us unsolicited , the feeling of unease goes up just that much more . Via The Verge

If you 've noticed your Amazon Echo being a little less chatty than usual , do n't panic – a spell of downtime in Amazon 's cloud servers knocked out the Alexa app for a few hours , but all systems are go again and your Echo should be back to full functionality . Apparently Amazon Web Services was out of action for a brief spell , causing Echos around the world ( or at least in the US ) to respond with a `` lost connection '' message whenever their users wanted to know the latest weather or needed to find out just how tall the Eiffel Tower was . Other users reported sluggishness in Alexa 's responses , so the digital assistant could still respond to questions , but needed a good long think about them first . Most areas are now reporting that Alexa is back up and running normally . Amazon Web Services , which underpins a host of apps such as Slack as well as everything Amazon does on the web , is responsible for around a third of all cloud services , according to Wikipedia . When it hits issues , chances are you 'll see it in more than one app . The downtime actually mirrors the advert Amazon recently ran during the Super Bowl , where a series of celebrities were given the cold shoulder by Alexa , and Alexa users were quick to draw comparisons between the two on social media . It just goes to show : you can put together the most sophisticated smart home setup possible , but if the services it relies on hit the buffers , you 're still going to end up switching on light switches manually and looking outside to see what the weather 's doing ... just like the old days .

Alexa is going to school for communication . Starting soon , you won ’ t have to constantly say Alexa ’ s name to get her attention during a conversation - Alexa will just keep listening and responding until you ’ re finished asking questions . The idea , according to Alexa Brain ’ s head , Ruhi Sarikaya , is to create a ‘ friction-less ’ interaction with the personal assistant . Sarikaya made the announcement at a keynote presentation at the World Wide Web Conference in Lyon , France . Read more : Anker Soundcore Wakey bedside speaker In the future , that will mean Alexa will be able to continue conversations more naturally - e.g . you can ask about the weather today , the weather tomorrow and the weather next week , all without pausing the conversation to say ‘ Alexa ’ in between in each query . In addition to that , Sarikaya detailed plans to add a reminder system to Alexa so that the personal assistant can keep track of long-range reminders like birthdays , and it will better integrate skills in your conversations . ( If you ask about removing a stain on your shirt , for example , Alexa might mention the Tide Stain Remover skill that walks you through the process step-by-step . ) These improvements will roll out to US , UK and Germany first , Sarikaya says , but refrained to give an exact date as to when we could expect the update to hit . Despite the lack of an official launch date , these improvements should mildly excite owners of the Amazon Echo , Amazon Echo Dot and Amazon Echo Show - they will , in many ways , improve the naturalness of the conversations you have with Alexa going forward . This might also help Alexa catch up to Google Assistant as some of these features - like reminders - have been part of Google Assistant ’ s programming for some time . Via The Verge

If you have kids and an Amazon Echo device , there 's a good chance you 've experienced the hilarity / horror of them accidentally finding some expletive-laden song just by their requesting goobledeegook . So a new Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition will be music to the ears of tech-savvy parents . Launching in the US first ( we 'll have word on global availability as soon as it is announced ) , it costs $ 79.99 – considerably more expensive than a standard Echo Dot . However , it does come with some unique , child-friendly perks , including a two-year damage replacement warranty , a colorful rubber case in either red , blue or green and a year 's subscription to the FreeTime Unlimited kid-focussed service . Read more : Amazon Kindle Paperwhite review With Alexa , FreeTime Unlimited lets parents leave their children in the capable hands of a selection of expletive-free radio stations including IHeartRadio Family , 300 appropriate Audible audiobooks and tailored premium skills from Nickelodeon , National Geographic and Disney , including alarms that sound like characters from their favorite shows and movies .

If you choose not to renew the FreeTime Unlimited service , you can roll back to the basic free service which , like FreeTime Unlimited , lets you block Alexa features such as shopping , news reports and access to third party skills and audio services . You just wo n't get all that curated kids content from Amazon 's major partners .

Amazon is known for taking risks and getting into categories well ahead of its competitors ( just look at the Amazon Echo ) , and the mega etailer could be looking to do that once again with robots for your home . That 's right : Amazon is working on domestic robots , reports Bloomberg . The top-secret project is codenamed Vesta , and could see robots in employee homes by the end of this year , with consumers possibly able to buy their own bots by 2019 . Recently , Amazon began to ramp up hiring at its Lab 126 , where the robot is being developed . Lab 126 previously concocted Amazon Fire TV , the Amazon Fire tablets , Echo smart speakers and the Amazon Fire Phone ( remember that ? ) , according to Bloomberg . It 's not exactly known how the robot will function , but Bloomberg 's sources speculate it could follow homeowners around to rooms where an Echo is n't already in place . Alexa , Amazon 's voice assistant , will likely figure heavily in the robot . Already , prototypes feature advanced cameras and computer vision software , allowing the robot to move around a home like a self-driving car , presumably aware of the surroundings and avoiding obstacles . Amazon currently uses robots in its product warehouses , though obviously Vesta bot would be specialized to operate in the home . While Amazon would likely beat main rivals Google and Apple to the punch when it comes to domestic robots , other companies , like LG and Sony , have already developed robots that perform tasks or provide some level of companionship . The big question , aside from whether Amazon 's robot ambitions ever come to fruition , is how much the Alexa robot will cost . Chances are , it 'll be pricey , though Amazon may be able to undercut the cost for its Prime members . A domestic robot would give Amazon an explicit in into your home , and we speculate the robot would quickly learn your habits , such as when you turn off lights in a certain room , as well as what products you buy ( we could easily see it sensing when you need to restock on laundry detergent and filling an order for you ) . As the company looks for more ways into your home , a domestic robot makes a whole lot of sense .
Apple 's Siri , the Google Assistant , Microsoft Cortana , and Amazon Alexa are all competing for our attention these days . Still , the world of voice assistants is getting a bit confusing , especially if you just want to order a USB cable for your laptop or get directions . In the new 2018 Ford EcoSport – a subcompact crossover that has at least a hint of Subaru ruggedness ( with a $ 19,995 price tag ) – you can connect up and use three of those four voicebots . While Cortana plays catch-up , and both Apple and Google have provided voice interaction in cars for a years , it ’ s Alexa that provides some of the most interesting features . Not all of them work perfectly , but there ’ s a hint of things to come . One of the signs that we ’ re not quite at the point where phones and cars get along perfectly is related to the setup . It ’ s not hard , but it ’ s also not totally intuitive . To use an iPhone , you first have to disable CarPlay on the EcoSport touchscreen ( you might be tempted to look for a way to disable the feature on your phone , but that doesn ’ t work ) . You ’ ll need to install a Ford app for Alexa on your phone . Then , under a new mobile apps section on the EcoSport , the Alexa app will suddenly appear . ( The steps are similar if you are using an Android phone . ) Once you see the bot , you can click the icon on the touchscreen , press the Ford Sync button and say “ Alexa ” to start using Alexa , or utter “ Alexa ” to your phone . This last step is the strangest of all – normally , you can ’ t say Alexa to an iPhone , but in the EcoSport , you can . Using Alexa in the EcoSport was a bit frustrating at first . We had to reboot our phone as a refresh , but during an initial test the bot would sometimes not work and not answer questions . In a second test , most questions about playing music , the weather , and navigation got a response . It ’ s an odd experience to have full access to Alexa , because you can get lost in conversation . After ordering some beef jerky at Amazon.com , streaming a Radiohead album , asking the bot to close a garage door using a Vivint security system , and then goofing around by asking a bunch of trivia questions , it became obvious that this is the future of car technology . You can envision a day when all we do is drive and talk . That ’ s a nirvana state for sure . Another nice touch ? If you ask Alexa about a business like Starbucks , the bot then shows a list of options on the touchscreen . You can select one , and then see the navigation using the EcoSport touchscreen . It ’ s a bit different from how CarPlay and Android Auto work , because it uses Ford Sync and the EcoSport in-car nav system ; Apple and Google use their own nav that runs on the touchscreen . ( They look quite different and seem more like add-ons . ) You can play music from your [ Amazon ] Prime account just by queuing that up “ We have two really cool integrations , ” says Elizabeth Halash , the Ford Connected Vehicle and Services Supervisor . “ One is called the Alexa+Ford mobile app from the Google Play store or the Apple App Store , to enable the most common Alexa commands in the vehicle . You can play music from your Prime account just by queuing that up . `` We also have integration with our navigation to get directions , all hands-free . The other integration is on the Skills side of things , so for people who have an Echo device , you can call up different Skills . You can say , 'Open FordPass ' to remote control the car or get information about the vehicle back to you . ” That kind of integration is a step in the right direction for sure . In future Ford cars and trucks , it might be nice to have a single dedicated Alexa button , and no configuration at all . The fact that you even need your phone seems odd . If Ford can figure out how to make voice assistants work without a phone , and you can still make calls , get directions , and play music , then Alexa could help with just about everything else . It would be even cooler if Alexa could tell you when you need an oil change , arrange for service at the dealership , and monitor teen drivers .

Sony has announced that it ’ s celebrating upcoming PlayStation 4 exclusive , Detroit : Become Human , going gold by releasing a demo of the very first scene in the game . More interesting than the demo , however , is the reveal that it will have its very own Alexa skill . Named CyberLife , the skill will give players guidance and advice to help them make their first decisions in this choice-filled game world . Called Hostage , the demo will have players take up the role of an android called Connor , a hostage negotiator sent into a fraught situation where lives are on the line . Using the CyberLife skill , players will be able to ask Alexa questions relating to details in the crime scene and the backgrounds of characters to guide them through the decision making process . Players will even be able to ask Alexa to find out which decisions had which impacts and find out how they might be able to alter the course of the game by doing one thing differently . This is n't the first time a game has created its own Alexa skill – Destiny 2 did so very recently by allowing players to interact with their AI companion Ghost through their own devices . This skill is also very in-keeping with the story of Detroit : Become Human . Set in a dystopian future , Detroit : Become Human is a game which follows the story of three androids who have started to experience human emotions in a world that sees them as nothing more than machines built to obey . The fate of these androids and the characters around them will be entirely in your hands , with all of your decisions and actions opening up a branching story that will be individual to you . We don ’ t think Alexa is about to start offloading its feelings when you come home after a long day , but it is the first step towards fully-fledged androids , and a good example of how they might know more than you already . To use the Alexa skill you simply have to have access to any Alexa-enabled device and ask it to download the CyberLife skill by saying “ Alexa , enable CyberLife . ” The demo will be available for download on the PlayStation Store on Tuesday , April 24 at 12:01 am ET/ 5:01 am BST . Once excited fans get through this demo , they ’ ll have to wait until the game ’ s May 25 release date before they can play again .
Set TV , a subscription IPTV service in the US , has found itself at the center of a lawsuit , accused of mass copyright infringement . The lawsuit comes from a group called ACE ( the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment ) that includes some of the biggest studios in Hollywood . The likes of Disney , 20th Century Fox , Columbia Pictures , Universal Pictures , Sony Pictures and Warner Bros are all mentioned , as well as Netflix and Amazon . The lawsuit alleges that Set TV “ relies on third-party sources that illicitly reproduce copyrighted works and then provide streams of popular content such as movies still exclusively in theaters and television shows ” . This type of lawsuit isn ’ t uncommon , given that movie and TV studios are extremely protective of their IP , but having so many big names team up against a single potential copyright infringer , especially one that touts itself as a paid service , is noteworthy . One of the reasons why those companies are taking Set TV so seriously may be how professional the service looks , with the lawsuit explaining that on the surface it does look legitimate . “ For the customers who use Setvnow , the service provides hallmarks of using authorized streaming services – a user-friendly interface and reliable access to popular content – but with a notable exception : the customers only pay money to Defendants , not to Plaintiffs and other content creators upon whose copyrighted works Defendants ’ business depends , ” the suit reads . If the lawsuit is successful , the service would be shut down and there could be substantial fines , too – $ 150,000 for each piece of content on the site that infringes copyright . With Set TV offering 500+ channels , those costs could well spiral . Getting 500+ channels for just $ 20 a month does seem like a bargain . Currently , the cheapest Sling TV Package offers 30+ channels for $ 20 . YouTube TV lets you view 50+ YouTube TV channels for $ 49 , while Hulu and DirecTV also have competitive pricing for 50-60 channels . A spokesperson for ACE contacted TechRadar to say this about the case : “ ‘ Setvnow ’ and other piracy software applications undermine the legal market for films and television shows , causing harm to a vibrant creative economy that supports millions of workers around the world . `` ACE is dedicated to protecting creators and reducing online piracy through dedicated actions against illegal enterprises like ‘ Setvnow . ’ ” Via TorrentFreak and GeekWire

Dinner is ready , but little Jimmy is glued to his Call of Duty deathmatch and your partner is still working that spreadsheet in the home office . You could holler and shout up the stairs to corral the family , but Amazon wants its Amazon Echo smart speaker range to take the strain instead . Read more : I-box Century review The new Alexa Announcements feature for the Echo range will let you record a message through your smart speaker , and have it broadcast around the home . With the `` Alexa , announce that ... '' or `` Alexa , tell everyone ... '' commands , you 'll be able to say , for instance `` Alexa , tell everyone that dinner is ready '' and have the `` dinner is ready '' part relayed in your voice to every Echo device on your network at once . It 's worth noting that it 's a one way system – those on the other end of the Echo will not be able to respond to the announcements , making it very much an instructional exchange . But the point is to offer a complimentary feature to Alexa 's existing communication options . The smart speakers can already make calls to other Alexa devices , while the Drop In feature lets you have a conversation with one other Alexa device in your home or with another person 's device in your contacts book . The Alexa Announcements feature rolls out today , and is compatible with all Echo generations , the Echo Dot , Echo Spot , Echo Plus and Echo Show .

The first round of Amazon Fire TV Edition smart TVs hit shelves last year and were met with a tepid response . It ’ s not that people hated the dovetailing of their streaming video player and their traditional ‘ dumb ’ TV - far from it , I ’ m sure - it ’ s just that reviewers and buyers alike didn ’ t particularly love the panels Amazon ’ s smart OS made its way onto . That said , Amazon is giving it another shot in 2018 . This time , using Best Buy as the conduit to consumers . Read more : TCL 8-Series 8K QLED Roku TV The two announced a partnership on Wednesday that will bring 10 new Amazon Fire TV Edition smart TVs to Best Buy in 2018 from manufacturers like Toshiba and Insignia . The TVs will include both 4K and HD models and will be available starting this summer . “ These Fire Edition smart TVs by Insignia and Toshiba deliver beautiful visuals and all the movies and TV shows you love , with an experience that gets better every day with Alexa , ” adds Jeff Bezos in a press release . “ We could not have a better partner in this endeavor . ” You could . Just like you could buy a Roku Streaming Stick+ instead of one of the many excellent Roku TVs . But doing so is an extra cost , and the operating systems - both in the case of Roku and Amazon - are generally just as good if not better on the TV . Amazon Fire TV ’ s strong suit is , of course , the addition of Alexa that enables smart home control functionality and all of the intelligence Amazon has built into its smart assistant . There ’ s a dedicated section of the home screen for Amazon Prime TV Shows and Movies , plus a nifty remote that can call up Alexa on demand . If you ’ re confused to hear that Amazon and Best Buy are working together on something , it ’ s because the deal with Best Buy is one that benefits both parties . Best Buy will have the exclusive rights to sell select TVs that appeal to its price-conscious consumers and in return Amazon will give Best Buy a dedicated section on its online storefront . Plus Amazon now has a physical space to demo its TVs . Seems like a win-win here . Now all we need is an OLED Fire TV and we ’ ll be all set .
It 's been a bumper year already for sci-fi TV , with Netflix bringing Richard K. Morgan 's Altered Carbon novel to screens , Duncan Jones ' Mute following it and Westworld set to make a return for series 2 . Not wanting to be left out , Amazon made a big signing for its Prime video service , bringing legendary cyber-punk author William Gibson 's novel The Peripheral to its streaming platform . Read more : Amazon Echo Input Set to be scripted by Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan , the creative team behind the aforementioned Westworld re-imagining , Amazon have greenlit an entire series , without taking its usual pilot episode test-run route . The Peripheral centres around Flynne Fisher , who stands in for her brother ( a security specialist ) in a virtual world hosted in a near-future America . However , as you 'd expect , all is not what it seems , and when Fisher begins to recognise London landmarks , and witnesses a murder , the creeping feeling that this could be happening in a real world reality too starts to settle in . Amazon 's latest signing will follow a string of high-profile adaptations it has in the works , included a new series based on the Lord of the Rings books , and an adaptation of Ian M. Banks ' critically acclaimed opening Culture series novel , Consider Phlebas . Gibson is credited as the originator of the cyberpunk movement , planting the seeds for out current notions of cyberspace and virtual reality . While its his Neuromancer novel that many have wanted to see on the bigscreen since it was first published , The Peripheral is still a great story to adapt . And , with a sequel novel on the way this year , there could be plenty more for Amazon to tap into and adapt soon .

If you ’ re a fan of controlling things in your home using your voice , do we have some good news for you : LG has announced that it has partnered up with both Google and Amazon to enable all SmartThinQ devices ( of which there are over 100 ) to be controlled by voice assistant . That means if you ’ re one of the millions of people with an Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant powered smart speaker sat in your home , you can now use it to control any LG SmartThinQ products you also own . This isn ’ t the first time that you ’ ve been able to control an LG product with a voice assistant , but is the introduction of an open platform that allows you to choose between Alexa and Assistant across all of LG ’ s smart products . It ’ s nice to see a sense of openness being adopted by a company as large as LG , especially seeing as one of the biggest criticisms we have of the smart home market at the moment is the walled-off ecosystems that mean you have to effectively choose a team , rather than just investing in the best devices . And with LG ’ s SmartThinq , there ’ s quite a range of devices that you ’ ll be able to control , including fridges , range cookers , air conditioning units , vacuum cleaners , washing machines , and more . Some of the use-cases that LG provides are the ability to ask Alexa to turn off your oven while you ’ ve got your hands full , or asking Assistant to get your fridge to make more ice . While some of the appliances possibly don ’ t need voice integration ( we ’ re thinking about the washing machines ) it ’ s a welcome move to see LG opening its SmartThinQ platform .

Would you let your smart speaker listen in on a wider range of your conversations , if it meant it could better offer you recommendations ? That 's the premise of a newly-uncovered Amazon patent , which details ways speakers like its Amazon Echo range could listen for trigger terms to record things that its users liked or hated . Read more : I-box Century review While Echo speakers currently wait for the trigger word `` Alexa '' before listening to and establishing what a user wants through follow-on voice commands , the patent describes the way the voice assistant could also listen out for words like `` love '' and `` like '' , and the sentences surrounding them , to establish a deeper insight into a user 's interests . Likewise , negative terms could be used to fine tune things the user did n't care about . This could in turn be `` useful for purposes such as targeted advertising and product recommendations , '' according to the patent . However , though the patent has been filed , and its potential is clear , Amazon says that it has no plans at present to implement its capabilities . In a statement given to the BBC , an Amazon representative said : `` We take privacy seriously and have built multiple layers of privacy into our Echo devices . `` Like many companies , we file a number of forward-looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology . `` Patents take multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services . '' For those that are still spooked by having a Silicon Valley snoop sat in their living rooms , however , even the exploration of such patents is likely a worrying development .

It 's hard to fault Amazon 's Fire TV range . Whether you 're going for the cheap-as-chips Fire TV Stick , or the souped-up Amazon Fire TV 4K streamer , they 're affordable and powerful ways to tap into the world of connected TV smarts . US readers have another reason to get on board with the range today , with Amazon knocking its pricing down considerably . The Fire TV Stick gets a $ 10 price cut , down from $ 39.99 to $ 29.99 , while the 4K Fire TV gets an even bigger discount , dropping from $ 69.99 to $ 49.99 . Read more : Amazon Echo Link Amp So , which is the Amazon player for you ? At a base level , both offer very similar functionality – you 'll get access to streaming services like Amazon Prime Video , Netflix and more , as well as some gaming apps . Each also comes with the Alexa Voice Remote , letting you search through what 's on offer via voice commands alone , and letting you control elements of your smart home . The two differ in terms of size however ( the Stick is much like a USB dongle in size , while the Fire TV 4K is larger and boxy ) , as well as in visual and sonic fidelity – the Fire TV 4K offers 4K UHD streaming options and Dolby Atmos audio playback , whereas the Stick is merely Full HD . At this price , the future-proofed Fire TV 4K device seems well worth a punt .

Amazon knew if it wanted to win back some prestige in the TV production world over the next few years , it needs a Game of Thrones-level hit on its hands . So when the rights to The Lord of the Rings became available , Amazon was all too eager to sign its name on the dotted line . The deal went down late last year and , for the first time , details have begun to emerge on what , exactly , the world ’ s largest online retailer got itself into . Read more : Amazon Echo Link Amp Namely , Amazon has bought itself a five-season commitment to a story set in Middle-earth . Amazon ’ s initial investment was a $ 250 million deal brokered between New Line Cinema and The Tolkien Estate - a bid that just barely beat out its rival , Netflix . But that $ 250 million deal was just the beginning . New reports from The Hollywood Reporter claim that , after factoring in casting , producers and visual effects , it could cost Amazon well over $ 1 billion to make this show a reality . If those estimates are correct , that would mean the new series would cost approximately three times as much as the original trilogy cost to make a mere decade ago - and make the TV adaptation of The Lord of the Rings one of the most expensive TV shows in the history of the medium . This would n't be a huge problem but , remember , Tolkien ’ s world is finite - unlike , say , George R.R . Martin ’ s A Song of Ice and Fire which currently has five massive missives , plus two more on the way . Unless we ’ ve yet to discover a hidden cache of Tolkien ’ s work , we ’ ll soon have to dive into the unwieldy pre-Baggins world of The Silmarillion or The History of Middle-earth , compiled by J.R.R . Tolkien ’ s son in the ’ 80s and ’ 90s . There are stories to be told here , sure , but audiences might not respond as kindly to Morgoth as they did to his padawan , Sauron . Speaking of villains , it ’ s certainly possible that Bob and Harvey Weinstein might make their way into these deals one way or another : When the first film in The Hobbit trilogy came to theaters , the Weinsteins used a deal inked in 1998 between themselves and New Line to snag $ 12.5 million of the production company ’ s profits . That ’ s not even considering Peter Jackson , the golden boy of the franchise and the one responsible for hoisting the series from made-for-TV movies to million-dollar blockbusters . Jackson has not yet commented on whether he might join on in Amazon ’ s grand adventure - although , according to The Hollywood Reporter , Jackson ’ s lawyer has been working to bring the famous director/creator and Amazon closer together . Should Jackson or the Weinsteins finagle their way into separate deals and/or lawsuits , it could further run up Amazon ’ s tab . Hopefully Amazon has a dragon ’ s hoard worth of gold up there in Seattle to pay for all this .

Since the Amazon Echo Button launched in September 2017 as a fun game accessory for your Amazon Echo devices , Amazon has only released 22 Alexa skill games for the device , most of which don ’ t have the greatest reviews . Thankfully , Echo Button owners hungry for new content may not have to wait long as Amazon announced on Tuesday the release of the Gadget Skills API Beta . Read more : Amazon Kindle Paperwhite review Now , independent developers can use the Alexa Skills Kit to integrate the Echo Button ’ s “ inputs and actions ” into their Alexa apps . As part of the announcement , Amazon unveiled some games that indie devs with advance beta access created , such as Color Tap ( which tests your reaction speed ) , Simon Tap ( the classic Hasbro game , only with Alexa and your Button ) and Freedom Buttons ( a recording of Martin Luther King Jr. ’ s I Have a Dream speech that lights the Button like a candle ) . The Freedom Buttons Skill shows Amazon trying to make good on a CES promise to add some non-game Skills to Buttons . Amazon 's documentation page mentions how the Button can act as a “ sound effect generator ” or a colored light-up indicator—turning red when your timer hits zero , for example . Amazon even suggests devs can “ add Echo Buttons to an existing skill ” . So if you had an Alexa-enabled smart speaker or smart TV , for example , you could theoretically tell Alexa to make your Button an instant on-off switch for that device . Of course , with only one possible input available , your Button ’ s capabilities are fairly limited as an accessory to other devices ; we ’ re curious how many devs will take Amazon up on their beta offer . Amazon ’ s announcement also contains a hint that the Echo Button isn ’ t the only Amazon gadget that could work with the new API . The graph above specifically points out that the Gadget Controller Interface could work with any Amazon gadget , not just the Button . There are already a ton of gadgets with Alexa support , but Amazon ’ s new Gadget SDK could make it easier for developers to create their own game accessories with Alexa built in . With the SDK , Amazon says , Alexa can `` control your gadget to move motors , play sounds , flash lights , or trigger other actions based on customer interactions with Alexa '' . So if you own an Echo but do n't want to drop £20/ $ 20 on a pair of Buttons , you should still keep your eyes peeled for other cool Alexa Gadgets in the near future .
A new software update allows Amazon Fire 7 ( 2017 ) and Fire HD 8 ( 2017 ) owners to use their tablets as an Alexa speaker . Rolling out with version 5.6.1.0 of the software , when the tablet is in use , or sitting on charge , users will be able to bark orders at Alexa , and the smart assistant will respond from the tablet . This gives the tablets the same abilities as the retailer 's Echo range of smart speakers , although audio quality from the slates wo n't be as good as the dedicated devices . It 's easy to switch this new Alexa mode on . Just swipe down from the top of the screen and tap the Alexa Hands-Free icon in the quick actions menu , or tap the Settings icon , tap Alexa , then tap the switch for Hands-Free Mode . Amazon 's support page for Alexa on the tablets states : `` Fire 7 ( 7th Generation ) and Fire HD 8 ( 7th Generation ) devices support Alexa hands-free when the device is being used , or when the device is connected to a power source ( whether it is asleep or not ) . `` They do not support Alexa hands-free when the device is asleep and unplugged , or asleep and connected to a low power source , such as a USB port on a computer . `` If you have a PIN or password set on your device , certain Alexa features wo n't be available without entering it . '' The software update is free , and arrive over-the-air , so your tablet should update automatically . To check with software version you 're on , dive into the settings .
Amazon has announced that Amazon Alexa users can now add music , podcasts and live radio into their Alexa Routines . First launched back in 2017 , Routines are a way to get your smart assistant to accomplish multiple tasks with a single command – say “ Alexa , I ’ m home ” for example , and you could have your lights , heating and TV switched on in one fell swoop . Now , though , you could add whale sounds from Spotify to that Routine for those particularly stressful days . Read more : I-box Century review Your Routines can include music from a specific artist , album , playlist or radio station and supported services currently include Amazon Music , Spotify , Deezer , TuneIn and Pandora . According to Amazon you can also create a volume action to control how quiet or loud the audio output will be . These more well-rounded Routines appear to be part of a concentrated effort on Amazon ’ s part to make Alexa a more personable assistant that ’ s useful beyond single commands and actually helps you in your daily routine . Alongside these music controls you can also use Routines to get weather , news and traffic reports , control your smart home and have Alexa chime in with a phrase like “ welcome home . ” Conveniently , it ’ s also possible to schedule these Routines so if you ’ d like to wake up on a weekend morning with your favourite podcast playing while your smart coffee maker starts brewing you can . Despite the fact that Alexa was able to use Routines before Google Assistant , it ’ s worth noting that music integration is already available in Google Routines . Google Assistant Routines can also support audiobooks and while there ’ s no Audible support for Alexa Routines just yet , we imagine that ’ ll be in the works too if Amazon wants to be on even footing with its rival . You ’ ll find the ability to customize your Routines with music in the Amazon Alexa iOS and Android app as it rolls out over the next day or so .

Smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home always listen to everything we say ; but until they hear trigger phrases like “ Hey Google ” , they aren ’ t supposed to record or respond , preserving our sense of privacy . But patents recently uncovered by the New York Times show that Amazon and Google developed and patented tech that could have smart speakers or smart home devices capture intimate details of people ’ s lives in order to develop advertising profiles for their customers . Read more : Google Home Hub Amazon ’ s patent , titled “ Keyword determinations from conversational data ” , would have your Echo use “ voice sniffer algorithms ” to listen for trigger phrases indicating your interest in a potential product . They would then record and analyze that data for your personal interests , and then sell that data to “ advertisers or content providers ” for personalized ads . So if you told your friend over the phone that “ I love to ski ” or “ my mother loves crossword puzzles ” , you would then find ads for a ski resort or gift ideas on your browser . Amazon vehemently insisted that it does “ not use customers ’ voice recordings for targeted advertising ” , and that this patent was submitted years ago while they were still “ explor [ ing ] the full possibilities of new technology ” . Google , meanwhile , patented technology to employ its Nest smart home devices to literally capture images and video of your house for advertising purposes , compiling profiles of your family members “ to ascertain gender , age , fashion-taste , style , mood , known languages , preferred activities , and so forth ” for each person . In one example , a smart device would notice a shirt with Will Smith ’ s face on your floor , triggering it to search your browser history for Will Smith . Google Home might then say , “ You seem to like Will Smith . His new movie is playing in a theater near you . ” A second Google patent put forward a number of other ways that your Nest security devices could study and profile users in the name of protection . For example , Google ’ s smart home could use sensors and audio monitoring to determine if a child is home alone , then keep the front door ’ s smart lock bolted until an adult gets home . Google even suggested they could monitor people ’ s “ habits ” and “ emotional states ” , or predict through audio recordings if children are up to “ mischief ” . They would profile everything from “ how often a household eats together ” to the probability that someone has Alzheimer ’ s disease . Like Amazon , Google insisted that their Google Home devices did not invade user privacy , and that “ Prospective product announcements should not necessarily be inferred from our patent applications ” . It ’ s relatively safe to say that Amazon and Google haven ’ t implemented most , if not all , of these patent ideas , at least as of now . Many of the ideas above are absurdly invasive , and are more likely to get users to smash their smart devices with a hammer than to buy Independence Day on Blu-ray . Amazon Echo and Google Home have lights that indicate when you ’ re being recorded , and smart speaker owners can check out Amazon ’ s and Google ’ s recording pages at any time to delete any data the tech giants have on them . When defective Google Home Minis started recording everything users said , Google swiftly resolved the issue . Nevertheless , these patents are an excellent reminder of the power smart devices have to compile personal profiles on users , profiles that can be used for political or monetary gain . The Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal shows that worldwide governments are increasingly concerned about how much data is being compiled about us by tech companies , and who those companies give that data to for profit . Like Facebook , Amazon and Google sometimes provide information to third parties about their users . The Times report pointed out that Amazon and Google may not share recordings with third-parties , but that Amazon will provide some requested user data like ZIP codes to Alexa Skills partners , and that Google will sometimes provide transcripts of users ’ audio recordings to third parties . Even if these companies don ’ t sell our data or monitor our movements intentionally , their smart home devices can be vulnerable to hacking . A security company hacked Amazon Echos to secretly record users , 24/7 , without any trigger words . And smart home devices , like the Amazon Key have been foind to be easy to compromise . The fact that Facebook has delayed its smart speaker reveal shows that people won ’ t trust them with their private data . Whether or not Amazon and Google will be able to maintain users ’ trust and avoid their own privacy scandals in the future remains to be seen .

Techradar Pro interviewed Lance Crosby , the CEO of StackPath , after the Server Density merger to find out more about the company 's plans for 2018 and more . Lance , Server Density is the sixth company that Stackpath has acquired or partnered with in less than two years . What 's the common theme across all six deals ? We want to own the edge and are building an inherently secure platform of services at the edge . In every situation , we thought about if it made more sense to buy a product we needed , or to build it ourselves . And for all six of these companies , they had the right product and a solid customer base and we could jump right in without taking the time to develop something from scratch . It 's worth noting that this is a merger rather than an acquisition . Stackpath has 1000x more customers and raised 120x the capital till now . Why opt for such a lopsided deal ? Why not simply absorb Server Density ? Typically , in an acquisition you buy the assets and the IP , and the executive team leaves and goes elsewhere . But in the case of Server Density , it is a merger because not just the executives , but the entire team is coming to StackPath . David Mytton , Server Density co-founder and CEO , is becoming a part of my executive team as VP of product engineering and will be responsible for monitoring and several other things . We want to be the ‘ Amazon of the edge ’ and own the edge Server Density started a movement called HumanOps which seems to been at the core of the acquisition . But rather than being a piece of tech , it is actually a community , can you tell us more about it ? HumanOps is a brilliant and long overdue resource for cloud workers and companies . This industry is evolving faster than any before it , requiring operations of unprecedented scale and solutions at unbelievable speed . I know first-hand how it really takes its toll on people because we have a 100 % uptime SLA . We ’ re looking forward to doing even more with HumanOps as part of StackPath –- look for more details on that to come in the near future . So you 've got VPN , CDN , server management , DDoS mitigation , web monitoring services and even , for the nostalgics out there , the company that fathered the venerable Usenet via Omicron Media . So does that mean that Stackpath is both a B2B and a B2C company ? Are there any missing pieces of the puzzle ? Anyone -– from an individual developer working out of his basement to some of the biggest Fortune 100 companies in the world –- use StackPath . So , yes . StackPath is a B2B , B2C and B2E company and is continuing to grow and add those “ missing pieces of the puzzle ” . What 's next for Stackpath ? ( Talk about the new company ) . You mentioned in a recent interview that Stackpath will offer 12 services by end 2018 ? Any chances you could shed more light on that ? July 1 will be a big day for us as we will roll out a new website , as well as new logo , colors , and messaging . Everything on the platform , including Server Density and all other services we ’ ve purchased , will die that day and we will introduce another half dozen services we ’ ve developed internally . By the end of 2018 , we will have not 12 services but up to 18 , so 18 in 2018 . We want to be the ‘ Amazon of the edge ’ and own the edge . We already have the lead , but these new services will help us solidify that . By 2025 , we want to say all internets transverse StackPath at some point .

LG has launched the SmartThinQ Skill for Amazon Alexa , which means a number of the company ’ s latest TVs are now compatible with Alexa-enabled devices . The collaboration between LG and Amazon means television models including the 2018 LG OLED TVs and LG SUPER UHD TVs with LG ’ s AI ThinQ technology can now be controlled with voice commands to any Alexa device , from the Echo Plus to the Echo Dot . Those with one of the compatible models will be able to ask Alexa to carry out all of the tasks you ’ d expect you ’ d need for a TV , including adjusting volume , play , pause , start , stop , fast forward controls , channel selection and searching for content . For example , you can now say , “ Alexa , turn down the volume on my living room TV ” or “ Alexa , change the channel on my bedroom TV to Sky One . ” The Alexa Skill also means you ’ ll be able to open up LG 's webOS Smart TV apps as well , so you can now say , “ Alexa , ask LG to launch YouTube on my kitchen TV . ” But LG isn ’ t the first television manufacturer to team up with Alexa . Some of Sony 's TVs have Alexa integration and you can use an Echo to turn your TV on and off , change its channel , and control volume . Also , Amazon users can control their Fire TV devices with an Echo and the functionality also works with TVs that have Amazon ’ s Fire TV software built-in . Because the functionality to control a television works through Alexa ’ s Smart Home Skill API , we can expect more TV manufacturers will work on enabling the functionality in the near future . Just as LG is n't the only TV manufacturer to get Alexa , Alexa is n't the only smart assistant making a play for your TV . LG announced a similar software update at the beginning of May 2018 to bring Google Assistant to its 2018 OLED and Super UHD TV range .

Update : Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has confirmed that The Expanse will return on Amazon Prime , though as yet there 's no fixed date for season four . Our original story continues below ... Read more : Living DNA review The Expanse has been around for three seasons now and was Syfy ’ s big push into creating a blockbuster science-fiction TV show . Big money did mean , however , that the show would have to attract some big viewing figures . Unfortunately for The Expanse fans , a 25 % drop in season two and a further 5 % in season three meant that Syfy had no option but to cancel . There 's no such thing as ‘ cancellation ’ in the age of Netflix and Amazon Prime , though , services that have become the home of second chances . Although nothing has been signed , it is thought that The Expanse will continue its fourth season on Amazon Prime - a place where money is seemingly no problem , especially when the boss of the company , Jeff Bezos , is a fan of the James SA Corey 's best-selling books on which The Expanse is based . The show is no stranger to streaming platforms - its previous seasons are currently streaming on Amazon Prime in the US and on Netflix in the UK , and has made it into TechRadar ’ s best shows on Netflix list . If The Expanse does come to Amazon Prime , it will join a roster of big budget shows in production . These include a Lord Of The Rings TV series , which will follow the exploits of a young Aragon , Utopia ( a remake of the superb UK show ) , a TV version of the movie Hanna and Jonathan Nolan and Tina Joy ’ s latest drama The Peripheral . It will also see Amazon Prime wade into similar sci-fi territory as Netflix , which has been creating a number of movies and shows in sci-fi genre . Just last month , it was revealed that Netflix ’ s big push for this year and beyond is scripted sci-fi and fantasy drama . Via Hollywood Reporter

Amazon Echo smart speakers are leading the charge in terms of sheer numbers finding their way into our homes , and for good reason , they come in a variety of sizes , qualities , and with prices for every budget . The range may have started with the original Amazon Echo , but that was a few years ago now , and there are now five different devices on offer ( and that 's the conservative number ) . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 There are Echos with screens in the Amazon Echo Show and Amazon Echo Spot , with smart home hub features in the Amazon Echo Plus , and for the conscious in the Amazon Echo Dot . Confused ? We do n't blame you . So here ’ s our ranking of the Amazon Echo lineup as it currently stands . We ’ ve divided the list into two sections , screen-less and screen-equipped , and we 've omitted the left-field Amazon Echo Look because it 's just so different from the rest of the lineup . Note that while all the devices featured here are available in the US , some have yet to be released outside the US , and Amazon has yet to launch its Echo range in some countries . The one that 's juuuust right Weight : 821g | Size : 148 x 88 x 88 mm | Drivers : 2.5 '' woofer and 0.6 '' tweeter | Aux-out : Yes | ZigBee smart home hub : No | Screen : N/A The new version of the Amazon Echo made a number of changes compared to its predecessor . It switched to using a pair of buttons to control volume , it replaced its matt plastic in favor of fabric , wood and metallic finishes , and it added a 3.5mm jack to allow it to be hardwired into an external speaker . It 's also the perfect entry point into the Amazon Echo ecosystem . It might lack the bigger sound and smart home hub of the larger Plus , but we would n't say the price difference is quite worth the improvement . Read our full review : Amazon Echo The budget puck Weight : 163g | Size : 32 x 84 x 84 mm | Drivers : 0.6 '' tweeter | Aux-out : Yes | ZigBee smart home hub : No | Screen : N/A The Amazon Echo Dot is a much smaller version of the Amazon Echo , and is around the size of a hockey puck . There have actually been two generations of the Echo Dot released , with the second ditching the volume dial in favor of two dedicated volume buttons . The Dot ’ s size meant some compromises on sound quality had to be made , resulting in a sound level that ’ s fairly weak and tinny and unsuitable for playing music . However , an included 3.5mm jack means that it ’ s perfectly possible to connect the speaker to an external sound system if you want to get your tunes playing , and you can also connect to a Bluetooth speaker . We would n't advise you to buy this speaker if you want to do a lot of music listening , but if you want to try out Alexa on the cheap , or you 're buying it for non-music tasks , then the Dot is a fantastic budget buy . Read the full review : Amazon Echo Dot The beefier smart home helper Weight : 954g | Size : 235 x 84 x 84 mm | Drivers : 2.5 '' woofer and 0.8 '' tweeter | Aux-out : Yes | ZigBee smart home hub : Yes | Screen : N/A The Amazon Echo Plus is similar in appearance to the original first-generation Amazon Echo . Under the hood , however , a number of improvements have been made , and the most significant of these is the addition of a ZigBee-compatible hub . Zigbee is the connection protocol used by a number of different smart home devices , which usually come with a hub that must be plugged into your router in order to allow them to function . Having a hub inside the Echo itself means you no longer need this additional hub plugged into your router . In theory , so long as your Echo is connected to your home network then your smart home devices will function . In practice , however , smart home functionality is limited when using the built-in hub , and so you 'll probably want to keep using an external hub to get the most out of your devices . Combined with the price premium , the Amazon Echo Plus offers probably the weakest value proposition of the three screen-less speakers . Read our full review : Amazon Echo Plus The bigger screen-equipped brother Weight : 1170g | Size : 187 x 187 x 90 mm | Drivers : 2 x 2.0 '' full-range drivers | Aux-out : No | ZigBee smart home hub : No | Screen : 7 '' The first Echo device to be equipped with a screen , the Amazon Echo Show is able to show you a wealth of information that would be impossible on a regular Amazon Echo . A picture is worth a thousand words after all . As well as displaying visual information , the Show is also capable of playing video content from a variety of sources including , of course , Amazon Prime Video . The screen can also be used for video calls , or to stream a video feed from compatible smart cameras . We 're not convinced Amazon has built in enough screen-enabled functionality to make its screen a must-have inclusion , but what it can do it does competently . Read our full review : Amazon Echo Show The alarm clock replacement Weight : 419g | Size : 104 x 97 x 91 mm | Drivers : 1.4 '' full-range driver | Aux-out : Yes | ZigBee smart home hub : No | Screen : 2.5 '' The Amazon Echo Spot is a miniature version of the Show , replacing the 7-inch rectangular screen of the Show with a 2.5-inch circular screen . This smaller screen means the device is less useful as a video-watching device . Although this is still supported , the round screen does n't lend itself that well to long-form video viewing . Instead , you ’ re more likely to use the screen to read messages , show virtual clock-faces , or conduct video calls . The Spot 's small size also means the built-in speaker isn ’ t as good as the larger Show ’ s . But , in our brief tests with the device , it is better than its small form factor would have you believe . Amazon is positioning this as a compact device that you might want to have on a bedside table as opposed to the Show ’ s countertop-sized form-factor . Its size also makes it a great kitchen or desk gadget . And , whisper it , it 's the best-looking Echo device around at the moment Read our initial impressions of the speaker here : Amazon Echo Spot

Police departments in Orlando and Oregon ’ s Washington County are using Amazon ’ s facial recognition AI , in conjunction with body and security cameras , for real-time background checks to detect potential criminals in the act , or persons of interest . The ACLU published the information on Tuesday , based on documents and marketing materials it obtained . Read more : New World first look The organization reported that in 2017 , Oregon sheriffs used Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) to build a mobile app connected to Amazon ’ s facial recognition AI , Rekognition . With the AI , deputies can take screen shots from security footage and scan a database of mugshots for potential matches in record time . For this technology , Washington County pays around $ 10 per month , the Washington Post reported . In Orlando , no human input is required . Instead , Amazon has partnered with the police department to connect the Rekognition AI directly to cameras in the city . According to the ACLU , Amazon has provided extensive customer support to Orlando with the aim of the city serving as a proof of concept to other muncipalities . Rekognition project director Ranju Das detailed the results of the Orlando program during a recent Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) event . Thirty-three minutes in , Das shows footage from “ a traffic cam provided by the city of Orlando ” , and Amazon ’ s ability to spot human faces instantly . “ Authorized cameras are then streaming the data , ” Das continued . “ We are a subscriber to the stream , we analyze the video in real time [ and ] search against the collection of faces they have . ” However , the Orlando PD told NPR in a statement that the city “ is not using the technology in an investigative capacity or in any public spaces at this time . '' Washington County Deputy Sheriff Jeff Talbot , meanwhile , told the Post that the database they pull from only contains public record data and that accessing this data instantaneously is valuable , but is “ not mass surveillance or untargeted surveillance ” . He gave no data on whether the app had helped the department make any arrests . Pulling from the mugshot database could cause the system to unfairly target certain people : most police precincts nationwide keep the mugshots of those found innocent of crimes , or arrested but never charged , on file . The ACLU warned in its statement that if more police departments and sheriff offices deploy this technology , then police could use body cameras to record the names of people attending a political protest , or to disproportionately target minority communities with facial recognition scans . In a joint open letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos , the ACLU and other citizen activist groups demanded that , “ Amazon stop powering a government surveillance infrastructure that poses a grave threat to customers and communities across the country . '' In response to a request for comment from TechRadar , an AWS spokesperson provided the following statement : `` Amazon requires that customers comply with the law and be responsible when they use AWS services . When we find that AWS services are being abused by a customer , we suspend that customer ’ s right to use our services . `` Amazon Rekognition is a technology that helps automate recognizing people , objects , and activities in video and photos based on inputs provided by the customer . For example , if the customer provided images of a chair , Rekognition could help find other chair images in a library of photos uploaded by the customer . `` As a technology , Amazon Rekognition has many useful applications in the real world ( e.g . various agencies have used Rekognition to find abducted people , amusement parks use Rekognition to find lost children , the Royal Wedding that just occurred this past weekend used Rekognition to identify wedding attendees , etc . ) . `` And , the utility of AI services like this will only increase as more companies start using advanced technologies like Amazon Rekognition . Our quality of life would be much worse today if we outlawed new technology because some people could choose to abuse the technology . `` Imagine if customers couldn ’ t buy a computer because it was possible to use that computer for illegal purposes ? Like any of our AWS services , we require our customers to comply with the law and be responsible when using Amazon Rekognition . '' To attract customers to its service , Amazon and Rekognition have been completely open about the potency of the surveillance technology . In an AWS Machine Learning blog post late last year , Das detailed how Rekognition was updated to “ perform real-time face searches against collections with tens of millions of faces ” , reducing latency by 5x to 10x from previous iterations . He then described how the API could now “ detect , analyze , and index up to 100 faces ” , in order to “ accurately capture demographics … for all faces in group photos , crowded events , and public places ” . “ Now we can easily detect all the faces in one go without any complicated preprocessing ” , Amazon quoted one client as saying . In other words , it can help to catalogue the ages , gender and ethnicity of a crowd at an event in order to better target advertising . In other posts , Amazon gave coding advice for how to train systems to track down persons of interest or train live streams to scan faces . Public or private entities can now easily implement this tech with Amazon ’ s help , and people being filmed will be none the wiser that they can now be instantly identified . Sky News , for instance , used the API to scan the faces of guests at last weekend 's Royal Wedding . Of course , Amazon isn ’ t the only company to use open source AI technology to shop facial recognition to companies . Microsoft Azure ’ s Face API compares photos to see if a tagged person in one photo matches faces in other photos . Facebook has done the same for years , and has faced user privacy complaints as a result .
The next time you catch the scent of something rancid in your fridge , you won ’ t have to take whiffs of your takeout boxes to hunt down the source . Instead , just ask Alexa to sniff it for you . Smart tech developer Ovie launched a Kickstarter campaign today for Ovie Smarterware , a “ Connected Food Storage System ” that tracks in an app how long you ’ ve had certain foods , then notifies you when it ’ s probably time to dump said foods in the bin . When you buy food , you ’ ll either place it inside one of the company 's 'smartware ' 6-cup containers or attach a SmartTag tracking sensor to the food ’ s container . Then , you push a button on the container or sensor to sync it with the Ovie app , which will track all of the food in your fridge and how long it ’ s been there . Ovie has a set estimate on how long something like spinach will last , but you can manually change the countdown estimate if you know your farmer ’ s market spinach doesn ’ t usually last that long . And , as time passes , the button will slowly shift from green to yellow to red for a visual indicator of what to eat or cook next . The app will also send you notifications of what food to eat next , and what recipes you can make with the tracked foods in your fridge . Owners of a smart speaker with Alexa enabled will have the option to ask Alexa about their foods ’ status without having to open the app or their refrigerator door . Using an Alexa Skill , Ovie will program your assistant to respond to questions like , “ Ovie , what should I make for dinner ” ? Many people track their food purchases and eating habits , but actual smart sensors and Alexa reminders could help folks make sure they know exactly how much food they ’ re wasting in a given week . Of course , these sensors don ’ t actually track smells or your food ’ s rate of decomposition . Using Ovie ’ s connected food storage system could require a lot of hands-on fiddling with estimates to figure out what food lengths actually work with the groceries you buy . Depending on which backer perk you select , your Kickstarter kit could come with Bluetooth-enabled SmartTags , smarterware containers with a slot for SmartTags , and Universal Connectors and smart Clips that attach to boxes or bags and also have SmartTag slots . Right now , early bird backers can opt for the cheapest option at $ 60 ( about £45 , $ 80AUD ) . Ovie 's campaign is currently almost $ 15,000 pledged out of a goal of $ 40,000 . Via The Verge
A new business app store for the Amazon Marketplace e-commerce platform will allow third party retailers to procure software to help them increase sales . The Amazon Marketplace Web Service ( MWS ) has more than one million SMB users and is essentially a way for sellers to share information about inventory , orders and logistics with Amazon . The new ‘ Seller Central ’ app store will make it easier to identify tools that can help with pricing , inventory , advertising and other tasks . It will be rolled out on a gradual basis to ensure there are no significant teething problems . `` Many developers have innovated and created applications that complement our tools and integrate with our service , '' Amazon told CNET . `` We created the Marketplace Appstore to help businesses more easily discover these applications , streamline their business operations , and ultimately create a better experience for our customers . '' Seller Labs will be one of the first software publishers to use the platform , offering its Ignite product for advertising management and Feedback Genius , which aids reputation management and customer communication . `` The open communication with Amazon and the new Developer Council helps Seller Labs ensure it 's developing the right features for our customers and provides the best experience for sellers , '' said Hank Harris , CEO of Seller Labs . `` The Marketplace Appstore is simply the beginning of bringing more effective tools to Amazon sellers .

Acer is proudly blazing the trail toward laptops with one of the most widely-used digital assistants across the world : Amazon ’ s Alexa . The Acer Spin 3 and Spin 5 – its latest mainstream laptops – will be updated with Alexa on May 26 and May 23 , respectively . This will allow both laptops to carry out nearly 100 % of Alexa ’ s capabilities on Amazon ’ s Echo speakers from within Windows 10 . Read more : Acer Predator Orion 9000 The laptops will also be the first to ship to retail stores and online retailers with the digital assistant pre-installed . Of course , Acer has no intention of stopping with these two laptops . The Acer Nitro line of mainstream gaming laptops will feature the tool when they ship later this June , while choice Aspire , Switch and Swift laptops – as well as Aspire all-in-one PCs – will include it as well . These two laptops were recently updated with the latest in Intel 8th generation processors – Core i3 to i5 for the Spin 3 and Core i5 to i7 for Spin 5 – with the Spin 5 also configurable with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics . Both laptops offer up sharp , Full HD ( 1,920 x 1,080 ) multi-touch displays and microphones powered by Intel Smart Sound Technology , a digital signal processor that handles audio , voice and speech interactions . The Spin 3 and most other Acer laptops achieve this with near-field dual microphones , though the Spin 5 touts four far-field microphones . This way , you can treat Alexa on your laptop more like you do on a smart speaker , issuing commands from across a room . Of course , what this all amounts to are the functions of Alexa that you may already be used to from an Echo speaker , if not through Cortana , Microsoft ’ s own digital assistant built right into Windows 10 . That means checking the weather , setting timers and calendar events , playing music , answering questions and smart home device management . The Acer Spin 3 starts at $ 499 ( £549 , about AU $ 659 ) and the Spin 5 at $ 699 ( £799 , AU $ 999 ) . Even if you ’ re not interested in these laptops , keep an eye on this space to see how Microsoft responds with Cortana across Windows 10 devices in the coming months .

Apple 's HomePod is trailing far behind its biggest rivals when it comes to the number of units shipped , according to new data from market research firm Strategy Analytics . Apple shipped an estimated 600,000 HomePods in the first quarter of 2018 , reports Strategy Analytics , netting 6 % of smart speaker market share . That 's significantly behind Amazon , which Strategy Analytics estimates shipped 4 million Amazon Echo speakers in the quarter ending March 31 , allowing it to corner a whopping 43.6 % of the market . The Apple HomePod did n't go on sale until February 9 , so it does have a disadvantage when it comes to time on sale . That other tech giant that sells smart speakers , meanwhile , shipped an estimated 2.4 million Google Home units in the quarter , giving it 26.5 % of Q1 market share . It 's important to note that Strategy Analytics is estimating shipments , not sales , so this is n't necessarily a reflection of how many HomePods were sent direct to consumers . Still , Strategy Analytics numbers line up with tales of underwhelming HomePod sales , which reportedly led Apple to scale back production . A few things working against Apple HomePod are its high price – $ 349 / £319 / AU $ 499 – and that you need an Apple Music subscription to make the experience worthwhile . It 's a good speaker for Apple device users , but if you 're outside of the iOS ecosystem , it 's a very hard sell . We 'll see if Apple makes any adjustments to HomePod , including releasing a cheaper version , as the year goes on , but suffice it to say , the new numbers ca n't be music to its ears .

Amazon Alexa skills are getting a new voice . Eight new voices , to be exact . That 's thanks to the Amazon Polly text-to-speech service , which Amazon is officially opening up to developers as part of a free preview . Read more : Anker Soundcore Wakey bedside speaker The eight voices will be in US English and will give devs who use them a chance to liven up their Alexa skills . This could include using multiple voices for different characters in a game , or simply having a voice other than the standard Alexa tone . Amazon Polly 's `` natural-sounding voices '' should bring a new dimension to Amazon Echo products , though it may not be quite enough to compete with Google Assistant . Just last week at its big developer conference , Google announced Assistant is getting six new voices , including celebrity appearances from the likes of John Legend . This is in addition to Google 's impressive and somewhat unsettling Google Duplex AI chatbot , which will use Google Assistant to make phone calls for you . The battle between Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa for voice assistant supremacy shows no signs of slowing down , and now it seems one important new front is which assistant has the most life-like voices .

Are you interested in an Amazon smart lock for your connected home , but worried about Amazon Key ’ s hackable lock and disarm-able camera ? Yale Locks could have a better , Alexa-enabled solution . Yale announced today that its Yale Assure Lock now supports voice unlocking through Amazon Alexa . You ’ ll be able to set up a four-to-eight-digit PIN , then speak that PIN out loud to unlock your Assure deadbolt when your hands are full . Any persons with Yale Z-Wave or Zigbee locks can currently lock their doors and check lock status through the Alexa app . But only Assure Lock owners can now link their devices with an Amazon Echo Plus or other compatible smart home hubs ( like Samsung SmartThings ) to unlock doors . Yale Assure will also let you enter your code using buttons or a touchscreen . Plus , you must opt into the unlock feature , since it ’ s off by default , meaning burglars can ’ t just say 0000 to get in before you set it up . Jason Williams , President of Yale ’ s parent company ASSA ABLOY , said in a statement that Yale ’ s customers had been requesting voice control . “ With the addition of the Alexa unlock feature our locks now allow consumers to secure their homes and enter them using simple voice commands , delivering a new level of convenience without any compromise on security , ” he said . Unfortunately , Yale ’ s press release made no mention of specific security features for the smart lock , such as voice recognition or anti-hacking measures . Outside of locking and unlocking , Yale says that its locks can be connected to a home alarm or automation system . That way , you can program your lock to trigger when an alarm sounds , or unlock right around the time you know your kid ’ s school bus arrives . Plus , you can give out specialized codes to specific people that only work at certain times—like giving your neighbor access when you 're away on vacation to water your plants—and you can check access logs after the fact to see when and for how long he or she visited while you were away . Of course , other Yale locks have these features , for buyers interested in other smart home ecosystems than Amazon . At CES 2018 , Yale also announced its specialized Nest x Yale lock , which lets you connect your smart lock to your Nest Secure Alarm and Nest Hello video-enabled doorbell for automated lock/unlock responses . Unfortunately , the Nest-specialized lock and Alexa-specialized Assure Lock won ’ t work interchangeably , so if you use Google Home , Nest x Yale could be your best bet . It seems likely that Yale will add Google Assistant support to its Nest locks in the near future as well .

Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) is cracking down on domain fronting , a practice that some folks use to get round state-level internet censorship of the likes seen in China and Russia ( among other countries ) . Domain fronting essentially enables access to a blocked ( censored ) domain by making the request to connect to that site appear to relate to a completely innocuous unrelated ( and unblocked ) website . Read more : New World first look It can be pulled off as long as the blocked domain and ‘ dummy ’ domain are hosted by the same provider , like Amazon , except AWS is now moving to stop the practice . As the Verge spotted , the new measures have been introduced in the form of ‘ enhanced domain protections ’ for Amazon CloudFront . The AWS security blog explains : “ Using CloudFront to receive traffic for a domain you aren ’ t authorized to use is already a violation of our AWS Terms of Service . When we become aware of this type of activity , we deal with it behind the scenes by disabling abusive accounts . Now we ’ re integrating checks directly into the CloudFront API and Content Distribution service , as well . ” Amazon says this is part of an effort to stamp out malware , and essentially dodgy practices in general , noting that while “ this technique can ’ t be used to impersonate domains ” , it ’ s clearly the case that “ no customer ever wants to find that someone else is masquerading as their innocent , ordinary domain ” . Of course , domain fronting is perfectly legitimate if it ’ s used by a customer who owns both the domains in question – obviously in this case it ’ s up to them what they do with their web properties . Note that another web giant , Google , already implemented countermeasures to prevent domain fronting last month , so folks who engage in this practice are rapidly finding the online world a much tougher place in which to pull the subterfuge off . Google made it clear that it never officially supported domain fronting in the first place . This comes at a time when state censorship is becoming increasingly tight in many nations , with the likes of Russia and China clamping down not just on web content deemed inappropriate , but on VPN services that can be a potential evasive measure , too .

Your Roku devices are about to get a real upgrade in audio playback thanks to the arrival of Amazon Music Unlimited on Roku OS . Music Unlimited joins Pandora , iHeartRadio and Vevo on Roku platforms , and fills the Spotify-shaped hole on Roku after that service left in December . For Music Unlimited subscribers the arrival of the service means that you ’ ll be able to stream tens of millions of songs and thousands of playlists and stations through your compatible Roku devices , while Prime members can stream more than two million songs and more than one hundred playlists and stations on Roku , at no additional cost to their membership through Prime Music . A subscription to Music Unlimited will run you $ 7.99 if you 're an Amazon Prime member or $ 9.99 if you 're not one already . ( Prime Music , on the other hand , is included with your Amazon Prime membership . ) The Amazon Music app is available for all Roku devices - including TVs like the TCL 6-Series and Hisense R7e , as well as streaming devices like the Roku Ultra and Roku Streaming Stick+ . To download it to your device , you can either use the Channel Store on the device or install it remotely via the Roku Channel Store .
In advance of Prime Day , Amazon has discounted the Echo Show smart speaker to a all-time-low $ 160 ( about £122 / AU $ 220 ) . But , if that still sounds too high , just turn your Amazon tablet into a speaker instead . Back in April , Amazon updated its tablets to respond to Alexa voice commands . In Hands-Free mode , 4th , 5th , 6th , and 7th generation Fire tablets can respond to the same queries you ’ d normally ask your Echo speakers . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 Now , Amazon plans to roll out a new Show Mode for Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 tablets . It ’ s a full-screen , always-on UI that , as with the Echo Show , shows up-to-date times , news and weather , and will respond to voice commands with large graphics and text that Amazon claims can be easily read from across a room . Show Mode will roll out in a free update to Fire 8 and 10 HD tablets on July 2 . Even more exciting , Amazon has opened pre-orders for the Show Mode Charging Dock . Drop your tablet into the Dock , and it will automatically charge and enter Show Mode ; remove it , and the tablet will immediately switch back to its regular UI . With an adjustable kickstand and magnets to keep your tablet in place , the Show Mode Charging Dock follows the same principles as a Nintendo Switch , making it easy to switch between docked speaker mode and portable mode without having to tap settings . You can pre-order the Dock for the Fire 8 HD for $ 35 ( about £26 / AU $ 48 ) , or Fire HD 10 for $ 50 ( about £38/ AU $ 68 ) . Both prices will go up by $ 5 when it officially goes on sale on July 12 . If you don ’ t own a Fire tablet , you can get a bundle with the Fire HD 8 for around $ 110 ( about £84 / AU $ 150 ) —well below what you ’ d pay for an Echo Show—or the HD 10 for around $ 190 ( about £145 / AU $ 260 ) . You can ’ t carry your Echo Show around the house with you , watch movies on it , or do anything else you ’ d normally enjoy on any tablet . Combining speaker and tablet into one device is an exciting move for Amazon . Echo Show will still have an edge over these makeshift portable speakers , however . Built specifically for voice control , the devices have better built-in mics and speakers than Fire HD tablets . It ’ s actually a bit disappointing that the Show Mode Charging Dock doesn ’ t solve this ; the product listing recommends you connect your tablet to Bluetooth speakers . So we ’ ll have to get our hands on a Dock this July and see how well and quickly our tablets register our commands , compared to an Echo Show built specifically for the job .

Universal has just unveiled a new audio adventure game set in Jurassic World that ’ s playable using only your voice . It ’ s called Jurassic World Revealed , and it ’ s available now for the Amazon Echo family of devices , as well as any other smart speaker with Amazon Alexa built-in like the Sonos One . The story of the game was written by video game legends Dave Grossman ( Secret of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion ) and Joe Pinney ( Telltale ’ s Game of Thrones , Jurassic Park - TellTale , Sam & Max and more ) and puts you in the shoes of an audio journalist named Janet Best as she attempts to uncover what ’ s really happening to the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar . According to Universal and the game ’ s developer , Earplay , the game is a companion experience for the film - which opens up in theaters on June 22 in the US and on June 6 in the UK - and is divided into six chapters , each of which lasts between 5 minutes or an hour depending on your decision-making skills . The first chapter is available to play for free right now with the five additional chapters costing $ 3.99 from June 22 until June 29 , and then $ 4.99 thereafter . Jurassic World Revealed isn ’ t the first audio-based interactive Alexa experience - Earplay has been making these types of experiences since 2013 - but it is one of the better produced ones . Audio production is high and the branching story arc feels interesting . That said , because you might be listening to an hour-long story , you need a relatively long attention span to get through it . While some might see this as shallow compared to the traditional mobile game release that often seems to come with big blockbuster films like Jurassic World , this game serves as a test bed for monetizing interactive audio content for Alexa - as well as a less traditional advertisement for the franchise . To try Jurassic World Revealed out for yourself , head into the Skills section of the Alexa app and enable it . Then , say “ Alexa , open Jurassic World . ”

Moto G6 and Moto Z3 Play are coming to Amazon Prime on June 29 with a $ 50 discount , which makes these already-affordable Android phones an even better deal . Thanks to their Prime Exclusive status , the two phones will be cheaper next week – $ 189 for the Moto G6 and $ 449 for the Moto Z3 Play . The new Moto phones join the LG G6+ and Moto X as tempting Amazon-backed smartphones . Amazon is further sweetening the pot by potentially including a Moto Smart Speaker on top of the Moto Power Pack for a limited time . This Moto Mod will allow you to use Alexa hands-free without dragging an Echo speaker around with you . The reason the phone is able to launch at this low price is because Amazon subsidizes the price of the phone by including a bevy of Amazon apps . Besides the cheaper price , another big selling point of these Prime Exclusive devices is the ability to integrate with Amazon Alexa . You can have some consistency in the digital assistant you use if you already use a popular Amazon Echo speaker . You ’ ll also get a single sign-on experience for the Amazon ecosystem , so that you don ’ t have to mess around with different passwords to do some online shopping on your device . On the Moto G6 , Alexa is available by double pressing the power button . With the Moto Z3 Play , Alexa integration will be available through a Moto Mod , accessories that you can snap onto your device to add extra functionality . Beyond the Amazon features , the Moto Mod also allows for expanded battery life – up to 40 hours – and more . But what about the actual meat of the phone ? Well , the Moto Z3 will be packed with a 8-core Snapdragon 636 , 4GB of RAM and up to 64GB of storage – plus room for expansion through microSD . The Moto Z3 also includes a 6-inch edge to edge AMOLED display , dual depth-sensing rear cameras , a fingerprint scanner , dual 12MP and 5MP rear-facing camera and Turbopower fast-charging . And , if that fingerprint scanner isn ’ t secure enough , it will also feature face unlock . You get both . If this all sounds like something you could get into , you ’ ll be happy to know that preorders for the phone opened today on Amazon , and without the Prime benefits on Motorola.com , Best Buy and B & H Photo .

Amazon Prime Day 2018 will take place on Tuesday July 17th with deals starting at midday the day before - Monday 16th . That ’ s all according to a Prime Day 2018 banner published on the Amazon UK website - presumably in error - and discovered by TechRadar this morning . The 36 hour period for Prime Day 2018 makes it the longest Prime ‘ day ’ ever - providing final and clinching proof that Amazon cares not for the mental health or sleep patterns of TechRadar 's hard working deals team . It eclipses last year ’ s 30-hour period which started the evening before at 9pm and also breaks with Amazon ’ s recent tradition of running Prime Day on the second Tuesday in July . Read more : Living DNA review Our original prediction for Prime Day 2018 was that it would take place on July 10th and 11th - but those are , of course , the days of the first and second semi-finals at the FIFA World Cup in Russia - not hard to see why Amazon would want to avoid those dates . With the World Cup Final scheduled for July 15 , that leaves the stage clear for Amazon ’ s two-day Prime Day bonanza on the 16th and 17th . The dates we have above are for Amazon Prime Day in the UK but - assuming this is not all an elaborate practical joke from Amazon 's design team - the exact times are likely to be marginally different in the US where of course there are multiple time zones . Last year , Prime Day began at 9pm Eastern / 6pm Pacific , and ended at midnight Pacific . So our prediction for Amazon Prime Day in the US this year is a midday start on the 16th EST , running all the way through until midnight on the 17th PST - that would mean Prime Day 2018 running for 39 hours in the US . In terms of what deals to expect , you can certainly count on an Amazon Prime subscription drive in the days or weeks leading up to Prime Day 2018 . Prime Day deals are exclusively available for Prime customers so Amazon tends to run a recruitment drive before the big day - expect a £20/ $ 20 discount on the usual subscription price if you ’ re not already a Prime member ( if you are already a member you ’ ll probably be out of luck on that one ) . Prime Day deals will obviously include heavy discounts on Amazon devices like the Echo , Echo Dot , Fire TV Stick , Kindles and tablets - Amazon regularly runs discounts on these items throughout the year so there ’ s a very good chance that for Prime Day it ’ ll haul out its cheapest ever prices on at least a few of these items if not all . You should also expect some tempting offers for some of Amazon ’ s other services like Audible . Aside from that , we ’ re also expecting Amazon Marketplace sellers to get in on the act in a big way this year . They ’ ve been included since the first Prime Day in 2015 but this year we ’ re forecasting that Marketplace retailers could be the source of some of the more exciting deals in pretty much everything product category on the site , from 4K TVs ( post-World Cup firesale alert ) , games consoles and laptops to beer and wine , sports and camping , and baby products and fashion . We ’ ll have an army of deals hunters working around the clock on Prime Day looking for what look like the best products and the best discounts - so bookmark TechRadar 's Prime Day hub and we ’ ll ensure you don ’ t miss out on the best Prime Day deals .

Amazon created Alexa to be your personal assistant , but now it will serve some vacation-goers as their personal hotel concierge . In hotels featuring the new Alexa for Hospitality service , guests will find an Amazon Echo , Dot or Plus in their rooms , connected to devices like the lights , blinds , climate control , TV and stereo via voice commands . Read more : I-box Century review Beyond your standard smart home ( or smart room ) commands , the Echoes will feature travel-related Alexa Skills . Guests can use Alexa to check out , ask for more towels , inquire about local attractions , order wine , turn on white noise or a TED talk , or request any number of other amenities . While the feature is not currently available , Amazon says it will eventually allow guests to temporarily connect their Amazon accounts to the hotel speaker , so they can access personal content like audiobooks on the go . Once guests check out , Amazon says the speaker will “ automatically disconnect their Amazon account from the in-room device ” . Alexa for Hospitality ’ s pilot program launched with Marriott Hotels as a partner . Marriott , which also owns Westin Hotels & Resorts , St. Regis Hotels & Resorts and other chains , will add Echoes to 10 US locations this summer , CNET reports . Other hotels have to request an invite from Amazon to join the program . One Las Vegas hotel installed 4,748 Echoes in its rooms back in 2016 , but this may not have been officially sanctioned by Amazon . “ Alexa for Hospitality makes your hotel stay a little more like being at home and gives hospitality providers new ways to create memorable stays for their guests , ” Amazon VP Daniel Rausch said in a statement . Jennifer Hsieh , VP of Customer Experience Innovation at Marriott International , added that , “ We will be evaluating guest feedback and adoption to inform how we expand the skills , features , and functionality offered through Alexa in our hotels . ” Amazon also encourages partnered hotels to use the Alexa Skills Kit to create their own custom skills , which will let guests requests specific amenities and services . Hotel Wi-Fi is notoriously unreliable and vulnerable to hacking . Using Alexa voice commands for your internet needs instead of connecting your personal devices could help keep your data safe from prying eyes and malware . Still , even assuming Alexa doesn ’ t start cackling in the middle of the night , some guests may not want something that ’ s always listening in their private room . Amazon promises in a customer FAQ that hotel properties “ can ’ t listen to what you said to Alexa or what she said back , ” and says that stored recordings of customers ’ questions will be deleted daily . However , the company also says , “ Using Alexa is optional . If you do not want to use Alexa , you can push the microphone on/off button built on top of the device. ” That seems to imply that these devices will be on by default when customers check in , which might anger some guests . We ’ ll have to wait see if this catches on , or proves to be a fad .

Amazon has just opened its US pre-orders for the Fire TV Cube at $ 119.99 ( no details on a UK release yet ) and it looks like another fantastic piece of kit . But when we 're this close to the Amazon Prime Day deals , we 'd certainly wait before taking the plunge . There will of course be plenty of other deals on a huge range of items on Prime Day 2018 . To find out what sort of bargains to expect , along with dates and times to get the best deals be sure to check out our guide to Amazon Prime Day 2018 . Why ? Well , just in-case you did n't notice last year , Amazon loves to discount its own products on Prime Day . Admittedly , they also get a few timed-discounts throughout the year , but the best ones are reserved for the biggest sales event of the summer . Going off past discounts on Amazon devices , we fully expect the $ 119.99 asking price to drop to at least $ 99.99 on Prime Day , so we 'd urge you to hold off on those pre-orders for now . What 's the worst that could happen ? It 's not going to go up in price after all . Waiting will also give you a chance to check out the reviews before you buy as the device has only just been announced after all . The Fire TV Cube is n't actually out until June 21 in the US and a UK release date has n't even been announced . Going off Amazon 's recent form though , we do think this is shaping up to be another winner , combining the smart speaker skills of the Echo Dot with the 4K streaming Fire TV device makes complete sense to us . You 'll get the most out of the Amazon Fire TV Cube if you 're a member of Amazon Prime as you 'll also get to enjoy loads of TV and movie content streamed in 4K . Not a member yet ? You can currently sign-up for a 30-day free trial that will give you a month-long taste of all Prime benefits including super fast delivery . If you 're not interested in 4K streaming yet , Amazon Prime Day will still have plenty to offer as we expect the standard Amazon Fire TV Stick to drop to an incredibly low price ( $ 25/£25 maybe ? ) for HD streaming of Netflix , Amazon Prime and other smart TV apps . The Amazon Echo speakers and Kindles are bound to get big discounts too . We think Amazon Prime Day will be on July 10 this year -Amazon usually confirm the date in late June- so there 's not too much longer to wait .

If you 're hoping to get some great Amazon Prime Day deals , we always have a hot wish list of items that we 're wondering if they 'll get some big discounts and we bet you do too . And if you 've been waiting to get involved with the world of smart speakers , we imagine the Google Home Mini has caught your eye . Of course , Amazon will be hoping hope to sell huge numbers of Amazon Echo and Amazon Echo Dot speakers on Prime Day - and they probably will . We 're well used to seeing Amazon discount multiple Echo smart devices on days like Prime Day , Black Friday and just for the hell of it at multiple times during the year . And whenever Amazon lowers the price , Google quickly follows suit with similar discounts on the Google Home and Google Home Mini speakers sold on its own store and at popular electronics outlets like Walmart or Newegg in the US and Currys , Argos and AO in the UK . Whatever price Amazon Prime Day unveils for the Echo Dot , you can be sure the Google Home Mini will match it at all the big retailers . Well , everyone except for Amazon who do n't actually stock any Google Home products thanks to a spat the two companies are having over YouTube on Amazon 's screen-enabled Echo devices . So what prices are we expecting to see ? Well in regular sales , we 're used to seeing the Amazon Echo Dot deals and Google Home Mini prices drop to around £34.99 ( $ 39.99 in the US ) down from the original £49.99 ( $ 49.99 ) - although both speakers seem to be settling around £39.99 in the UK at least nowadays . However , expect an even better deal on Prime Day . We suspect the Echo Dot will drop to at least $ 29.99 ( same as the Black Friday price ) and the UK price to potentially beat the frequent £34.99 sale price , possibly £29.99 . The Echo Dot is by far and away the best selling smart-speaker in the world - it was first to market and has been aggressively advertised ever since . The Google Home Mini was late to the party , but arguably has the better product thanks to the smarter Google Assistant ( sorry , Alexa ) , better compatibility with your Google accounts and android mobiles and the ability to use the free version of Spotify on it ( paid version only on the Echo speakers ) . What 's more , Google has really stepped up its advertising campaigns recently . And we 've generally found there 's no room for two different brands of smart speaker in a home , so it 's certainly time to pick a side . With both Amazon and Google potentially hacking into their profit margins with such big discounts though , it opens the way for some bonus add-ons to tempt a purchase over the rival smart speaker . We 've seen the Google Chromecast occasionally come bundled with some credit for the Play Store , so keep an eye out for something similar with the Home speakers . This is all fantastic news for buyers as no company wants to lose ground to the other on key discount periods so they 'll be keen to offer the better deals . Amazon Prime Day may be all about Amazon 's deals overall , but the giant retailer is all set to potentially provide an ample opportunity for Google 's Home speakers to catch up via price matching at other retailers . Whatever happens though you 'll be able to get a fantastic price on either smart speaker and we 'll be bringing you all of the best deals from any retailer in our Amazon Prime Day coverage hub .

Update : We have a review of the Amazon Fire TV Cube that you can read right now ! After months of speculation , we finally have our first good look at Amazon ’ s upcoming streaming player , the Fire TV Cube , which is set for release in the US on June 21 – we expect it to appear in the UK and other markets in due course . The device is a natural development of Amazon ’ s other TV-enabled media players . We already have the Fire TV Stick , a small dongle that connects to your home internet to stream online content services such as Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , HBO , and Netflix . There ’ s also the Fire TV , a square-shaped upgrade that can support 4K Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos . Both come with Alexa functionality , and the Cube looks set to take those capabilities even further , calling itself the “ first hands-free streaming media player with Alexa ” . Amazon seems to be betting on this combined functionality to sway consumers away from rival Chromecast or Apple TV devices . Much as on an Amazon Echo speaker , customers will be able to navigate Fire TV and play/pause/fast-forward content without the need for a remote , while still using Alexa for all their weather/shopping/trivia concerns . In contrast to the $ 69.99 Fire TV , the Cube will have its own Ethernet port , a larger 16GB of storage , and a built-in speaker – circumventing the need to use a TV 's audio output . Users will also be able to control other compatible smart home devices , whether that ’ s additional speakers , soundbars , thermostats , or cameras around your home . The Fire TV Cube is retailing on Amazon for $ 119.99 , with the option of including a Cloud Cam night-vision camera for a total of $ 199.98 . Amazon has n't announced prices for other regions yet , but we 'd expect the basic Cube to come in at around £120 in the UK . If you 're in the US you can pre-order the Fire TV Cube now .
It 's official : Amazon will be showing Premier League football on Amazon Prime Video in the UK from 2019 . The viewing rights to Premier League matches for the 2019/20 to 2021/2022 was up for tender and it was rumored that Amazon - and potentially YouTube - would get part of this package . Amazon will be showing 20 matches per season , although these are set to be more midweek than prime-time weekend fixtures . According to the official Premier League statement about the news : `` Package F , acquired by Amazon Prime Video , includes the right , for the first time in the UK , to make available a full round of live Premier League matches . '' In contrast , BT Sport will be showing 52 games a season and Sky Sports 128 games . While 20 games may seem like small fry , compared to what Sky is offering , it is a huge deal for Amazon and one that will likely mean Amazon Prime Video picks up a whole new audience away from TV and movie fans . Amazon will also be showing a behind-the-scenes Premier League show to compliment the matches - all matches will be offered to Prime Video customers at no extra cost . So what does an online giant like Amazon want with football streams ? Well , if they can be packaged up alongside its Amazon Prime subscription service , it 's another lure for those sitting on the fence as to whether sign up or not . And for the hardcore football fan , even making the football a premium bolt on on top of the annual Prime price may not be a turn off . As a retailer , Amazon is said to enjoy twice as much return custom from those signed up to its Prime special delivery service compared to those who do not . So tempting the UK 's large football following could be lucrative beyond even any streaming charges laid down .

A growing number of PC makers are planning to incorporate Alexa into their machines , and that growth could be set to seriously kick up a gear with Amazon ’ s announcement that three big ODMs are going to offer four new white-box ( unbranded ) reference designs which come with Alexa built-in . ODMs are original design manufacturers that provide PC designs for other vendors to brand and use , so you can see how this could spark a fresh influx of Alexa-toting laptops . Read more : Amazon Echo Dot ( 3rd Generation ) They will join the models already being pushed by Acer , Asus , Lenovo , and HP which we heard about at the start of the year ( indeed , Acer is already shipping Spin notebooks with Amazon ’ s digital assistant pre-installed ) . The ODMs in question are Wistron , Compal , and Quanta , and of the four white-box designs ( spotted by VentureBeat ) , three are convertible notebooks , plus Wistron is also producing an all-in-one PC . All these products are built to deliver a full ‘ far-field Alexa experience ’ complete with appropriate microphone arrays to ensure your voice commands are picked up ( hopefully ) . Wistron ’ s all-in-one sports a 27-inch UHD display , an Intel Coffee Lake S processor , integrated graphics , 32GB of system memory and a 128GB SSD . So it isn ’ t short on grunt , and it boasts a Full HD webcam with infrared , four MEMs microphones , and a pair of stereo speakers . The firm ’ s take on a convertible notebook boasts a 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen , and Intel Kaby Lake R processor plus 8GB of system RAM , and again four MEMs microphones . The 48Whr battery gives it a claimed life of eight hours . Compal ’ s convertible also has a 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen and four digital microphones , with more extensive battery longevity at 13 hours , and a fingerprint reader thrown in . As for Quanta ’ s hybrid laptop , that runs with a smaller 14-inch Full HD display , and again , four digital microphones , and it ’ s designed for taking on the road with 18 hours of battery life ( and it also has boosted security with a fingerprint sensor ) . Jon Kirk , Director , Alexa Voice Service at Amazon , noted that : “ These Windows 10 PCs have been designed from the ground up to support Alexa , bringing Amazon ’ s voice service to customers in new ways . ” Clearly , then , Amazon is making a big push to get Alexa on more laptops and PCs in general , making it easier for PC manufacturers out there to utilize a suitable reference model for their own products . Could we even see a future where Amazon takes a design like one of these and sells it under its own brand , as an actual ‘ Alexa laptop ’ ? That ’ s not what this move is about at the moment , but it ’ s an interesting thought to mull looking down the line .

In what was roughly a two-hour software showcase , Apple ’ s WWDC 2018 keynote had very few big surprises : we had guessed iOS 12 , watchOS 5 and tvOS 12 would make an appearance during the show ( which they did ) , and while the Dolby Atmos announcement threw us for a loop , it ’ s probably not the kind of announcement that will compel you to drive to the store and purchase an Apple TV 4K . Sussing through today ’ s announcements , the one that stands above the rest is the formal announcement of Siri Shortcuts – an IFTTT-like function that lets you group smart home tasks together but in a comprehensive-but-approachable way that the DIY-centric IFTTT could have only dreamed of . Apple may get mocked for doing it , but this is a great example of the Cupertino-based company taking an idea that has long existed and repurposing it into something more accessible ( read : palatable ) to mainstream everyday users . While I ’ d love to scold them for it – it ’ s absolutely genius : Siri Shortcuts might be able to bring the smart home to the lazy masses ( myself included ) . And while Apple has so far only mentioned Siri Shortcuts coming to iOS 12 , if or when Apple decides to push Siri Shortcuts to devices like the Apple HomePod , it ’ s very possible that it could completely outclass the Amazon Echo and Google Home family of devices in the burgeoning smart home space . Siri Shortcuts is a feature of iOS 12 that allows you to use a basic drag-and-drop interface simply called Editor to teach Siri a specific phrase that corresponds to either a single command or a number of commands . It ’ s confusing on paper – an unfortunate aspect of anything smart home-related these days – and yet , in practice , it should be relatively easy to use . One example given on stage involved the Tile app on iPhone where SVP of Software Craig Federighi used the phrase “ I lost my keys ” to use the Tile app to find misplaced items attached to a Tile sensor . Now , it ’ s worth pointing out that both the command and the action were both suggested inside the app – Federighi did n't use the Editor . Despite being basic , though , that level of integration straight into apps you already use is what makes Siri Shortcuts potentially a much better start for people than IFTTT . “ That demo was neat , ” you might think , “ but it ’ s something that could ’ ve been done by opening up the app itself and pressing a single button . ” I agree . So where things become more interesting is stringing apps together with a single phrase . A good example of that happened on-stage later when Kim Beverett from the Siri Shortcut project took the stage . In Beverett ’ s demo , she created a phrase called “ Heading Home ” that gave her an estimated time of arrival , sent a message to someone in her contacts , set her smart thermostat and turned on the fan , before opening Google Maps and turning on an NPR podcast for the ride home . It ’ s everything we ’ ve wanted a digital assistant to be in a single system that doesn ’ t require connecting a half-dozen services to your IFTTT account with mixed results . Siri Shortcuts requires you to be just as creative with the built-in Editor as you are with IFTTT , sure , but there ’ s little doubt in my mind that the final product will be easier , faster and more versatile than both IFTTT or Amazon Echo ’ s Skills platform . Before you go defending the oft trodden-on IFTTT , I understand that it ’ s not terribly difficult to set up a string of commands : You create a name for the command , connect the services/devices you want in that chain while giving the app the proper authentication/passwords and voila ! The problem lies with the fact that IFTTT is n't something you hold in your hand everyday , let alone trust to hold your music , personal contacts , emails and the dozens of other liberties we lend to our iPads , iPhones , Macs and HomePods . It ’ s tied to a service that has to then be connected into the chain and be made aware of all the other services you use in your life . Siri Shortcuts , on the other hand , leverages the power of the App Store , that little known platform that has around 500 million visitors per week . Once appropriately harnessed by developers , creating routines will be as simple as stringing together the apps you already use at various times of the day and assigning a name . 'Breakfast ' might be checking the weather , getting the estimated commute time , starting your daily news podcast and turning on a HomePod in your kid ’ s room to get them up and moving , while 'Good Night ' could just be all the apps you use right before you want to call it a night . Importantly , there ’ s no need to ask developers to make special skills that work with a voice interface ( cough , Amazon , cough ) and the apps you ’ re most likely to use are already installed on your phone , removing IFTTT ’ s barrier to entry . If Siri Shortcuts is as developer-friendly as Apple says , there 's no reason you wo n't see hundreds – if not thousands – of example commands before iOS 12 leaves beta – not as many Skills as most likely Alexa has , but ones that you 're more likely to use , understand and be able to adjust to your needs , definitely . Feed Siri Shortcuts into the Apple HomePod – a speaker that already sounds better than the Amazon Echo – and you have the recipe for the consolidated smart home system we 've been waiting for .

In what 's surely an absolutely innocent coincidence considering today 's events , Google has slashed the price of its Pixelbook laptops on Amazon today in the US . The discounts range from a whopping $ 250 from the entry-level version to $ 100 off of the highest-end model . Read more : Google Pixel Slate Get the Google Pixelbook for just $ 749 on Amazon Google has discounted its entry-level Pixelbook 2-in-1 laptop by a huge $ 250 or 25 % off.View Deal Of course , today is the day many expect to see Apple announce at least one new MacBook during its WWDC 2018 keynote event . Google clearly wants to detract some attention from Apple 's pomp and circumstance with a device that Apple would likely never dare attempt : a 2-in-1 laptop . One of the best in the category , in fact , for far less than Apple will likely price its new laptops . Take with that what you will heading into today 's proceedings , just know that we 've quite liked the Google Pixelbook even against the most current MacBook Pro . So , are you going to wait for today 's news before plunking down in either , or is this deal just too good for a laptop that can do a bit more ? Via BGR

You can load an Amazon Echo up with as many of its voice-activated Skills as you like , but if you ca n't remember the specific triggers for them , the Alexa voice assistant stops feeling quite so useful . Amazon is working to smooth out the search for specific Skill commands however . It 's rolling out a new beta feature called CanFulfillIntentRequest , which will let the developers of Skills tell Amazon the kind of questions their tool can answer . If a user then makes a vague request from the speaker , CanFulfillIntentRequest will then scan all the Skills in its database to find a Skill most likely to respond appropriately . `` As a result , customers find the right skill faster , using the search terms they say most naturally , '' reads the Amazon Alexa blog post . Using machine learning , the feature will consider factors like engagement and rating before delivering a Skill response , as well as , of course , how close its trigger aligns with your request . It sounds like a great , and arguably overdue , feature , which should take away some of those awkward moments when the voice assistant stumbles over what would otherwise seem natural requests . Keep in mind it 's still a beta feature though , before you start expecting your Alexa device to become an oracle-like fountain of knowledge .

Amazon Prime isn ’ t just life-changing because you can have all kinds of stuff delivered to your doorstep within 24 hours , it also allows you to stream TV shows and movies on demand . Amazon ’ s Prime Instant Video service has also been working on plenty of great , original content over the past few years , giving much of its licensed programming a run for its money and rivaling Netflix in the bid to be the top streaming service to rule them all . Read more : Living DNA review With that in mind , let 's take a good look at what ’ s definitely on the cards over the next few months , as well as some of the latest speculations about the original content that will be on the way in the not-so-distant future , from a refresh of Conan The Barbarian , through to Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett ’ s highly-anticipated Good Omens . Matthew Weiner , the creator of hit TV show Mad Men , is following up the huge , huge success of his adland drama with The Romanoffs . Very few details have been released about the upcoming TV series , but it 's a modern day anthology that 'll follow the lives of people who think they 're descended from the Romanov family . Sounds mysterious , right ? But we trust Weiner enough now to know this will be at least worth a watch and could easily prove to be a runaway success . Other than such a talented creator at the helm , The Romanoffs is already getting people talking for its particularly star-studded cast . It 'll star Mad Men favorites Christina Hendricks , John Slattery and Jay R. Ferguson , as well as Aaron Eckhart , Isabelle Hupert , Amanda Peet , Jack Huston , Noah Wyle and oh my goodness so many , many more ... When ? Friday 12 October Carnival Row looks like the stuff our dark fantasy dreams are made of , with fairies , mythical creatures and creepy killings all set against a backdrop of a neo-Victorian city called Burque . The show already has a star-studded cast with Cara Delevingne playing some kind of fairy and Orlando Bloom playing a police officer investigating a series of murders . Paul McGuigan , best known for directing movies like Lucky Number Slevin and Push , will be at the helm of the new TV show , which will consist of ten episodes . Amazon hasn ’ t released many more details yet , but production is expected to start in late 2018 , with a 2019 release date reportedly on the cards . When ? 2019 ( unofficially ) Readers in the US will have been treated to Amazon Prime Video ’ s first ever ad during the Super Bowl in February 2018 , which finally gave us a sneak-peek of the long-awaited Jack Ryan TV series , based on Tom Clancy ’ s spy novels . Starring The Office ’ s John Krasinski , the series is slated to be ten episodes long and will be the first time FBI agent Jack Ryan appears in a TV show . But it ’ s not the first time he ’ s been portrayed on a screen . You ’ ve probably come across Jack Ryan many times before without knowing it – Alec Baldwin played him in The Hunt For Red October , Ben Affleck played him in The Sum Of All Fears and so did Harrison Ford in Patriot Games . When ? 31st August 2018 We ’ ve had our fingers crossed for a Lord of the Rings TV show for years , but it looks like it ’ s now finally going to happen . After some speculation about which company would be taking the reins of Tolkien ’ s fantasy saga , it ’ s now official that Amazon has acquired the TV rights for The Lord of the Rings books with a multi-season deal . There ’ s been no official word about the stories that ’ ll be told in the TV series , but at the time of the deal an Amazon spokesperson said in a press release that it would “ explore new storylines preceding J.R.R . Tolkien ’ s The Fellowship of the Ring ” . More recently Amazon has revealed that JD Payne and Patrick McKay will be developing the big-budget drama . It 's not been confirmed yet whether the pair , who wrote Star Trek 4 , are to be writers or showrunners of the new series , but it 's good to know some experienced and enthusiastic creators are at the helm . When ? TBC Crush your enemies ! It ’ s finally here ! After lots of speculation , Deadline has reported that Amazon is currently working on a new drama called Conan , which is based on the books by Robert E. Howard . The new show will have Colony co-creator Ryan Condal at the helm as the creator and writer , alongside Game of Thrones director Miguel Sapochnik . According to early reports , the show will focus on Conan ’ s original story taken from Howard ’ s books , but they ’ re the only details we have for now . Although the story of Conan was written by Howard back in 1932 , and published as a series of stories in Weird Tales magazine , it ’ s been adapted for the screen a few times . The most popular was Conan The Barbarian , which was released in 1982 with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role . The move to create an original show about the iconic Cimmerian , alongside the news of The Lord of the Rings prequel stories , points to a big fantasy world-building focus for Amazon . This is hardly surprising given the huge success of Game of Thrones , which many critics believe the streaming platforms will try and ride the wave of with their own fantasy genre offerings . When ? TBC In 2017 Amazon lifted the lid on its plans for a TV series adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Prachett ’ s fantasy novel , Good Omens . Although the show isn ’ t set to be released until 2019 , leaked images of David Tennant , Michael Sheen and Jon Hamm in character have been already been causing a stir among fans . Those who loved the novel will be happy to hear Neil Gaiman has also written the six-part series , which is being produced by BBC Studios with Doctor Who and Outlander director Douglas Mackinnon at the helm . When ? 2019

Amazon Prime Video is full of great shows and movies , but the way you navigate its library has always felt clunky compared to competitors like Netflix . With a mixture of paid-for purchases and rentals , individual subscription channels and the content available with an Amazon Prime account , it ’ s sometimes difficult to track down exactly what you ’ re looking for , or to see at a glance what you can watch at no extra cost as a Prime subscriber . But this should be set to improve , with Amazon Studio head Jen Salke revealing that a new Prime Video interface is in the works . Read more : Travis Touch Plus Speaking at a presentation at the company ’ s Television Critics Association press tour , Salke said she had seen “ a prototype phone that showed [ her ] the interface that [ Amazon is ] working on that ’ s about to be – that ’ s in the middle of being developed and coming soon ” . Before you get your hopes up about the prospect of a new Amazon phone on the basis of the above quote , Slake has since clarified that she was solely referring to the prototype phone UI . While Salke says her team hasn ’ t “ felt an urgency to put a deadline on [ the interface ’ s release ] ” , she described it as being more intuitive for the user than previous efforts . What may come as a frustration to some viewers however is the news that , for the time being at least , Amazon is only talking about updating the platform ’ s mobile app interface – the big-screen TV version was not mentioned , but it could equally do with a refresh . It ’ s not the only change coming to the Prime Video service . The company will no longer be picking up entire seasons of its pilot shows via a user poll , but will instead use its own metrics and user data to make a decision . It ’ s not an unusual decision – many Hollywood studios now favor picking up an entire season at once based on writer ’ s room output , as viewers become impatient for a full series to launch following an initial pilot release .

Amazon appears to have some Google Home Mini envy judging by this first purported leak of the retail giant ’ s next Amazon Echo Dot through French outlets Numerama and FrAndroid . Naturally , the photos are impossibly blurry , which is enough to immediately give pause . However , markedly accurate Amazon product leak blog AFTVNews has verified the photos as well , claiming confidence that they ’ re the real deal . Read more : Amazon Echo Dot ( 2nd Generation ) Both of the French outlets have cited the codename ‘ Donut ’ for the product , likely speaking to anonymous sources . The photos ( rather poorly ) depict a speaker that appears to be a bit larger than the 2nd generation Amazon Echo Dot , using an adorable Kirby amiibo toy for scale . The speaker appears to contain all of the same buttons and controls as before , albeit with five microphones to the current model ’ s seven . But , the most important takeaway here is that the device is now wrapped in a sheet of mesh fabric , much like the Google Home Mini speaker . While it ’ s currently unknown why the new Echo Dot has adopted this design beyond catching up to the original Amazon Echo redesign , fabric mesh is an incredibly popular covering for speaker drivers . Perhaps Amazon has upgraded the 360-degree audio capabilities of the product , as FrAndroid ’ s sources claim . Sadly , there ’ s no more information regarding the product from this purported leak but , given that the device is supposedly already in the hands of employees or testers , we can ’ t be that far off from a release .

When you don ’ t have any problems hearing , the Amazon Echo Show is a great device . Its voice-first interface makes sending commands to your smart home a breeze , and it means that Alexa ’ s always on standby in case you have a desperate need for an answer to an inquiry . But , for people who are hearing impaired , using the Amazon Echo Show wasn ’ t always easy . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 Thankfully Amazon has set out to fix those problems with a new feature called Tap to Alexa that ’ s launching today for the Amazon Echo Show . The feature will place common Alexa commands on the Echo Show ’ s homescreen and will introduce a virtual keyboard to allow users to type in commands by hand . The aforementioned shortcuts will be customizable as well as swappable - if you don ’ t need a shortcut to turn on the lights in your home , you can swap it out for something more appropriate . Shortcuts , in this case , can consist of individual actions or entire routines . The Tap to Alexa update comes on the same day that the UK , Germany , Japan , India , France , Canada , Australia and New Zealand are getting Alexa Captioning - a separate feature that adds on-screen text for most Alexa commands . Both Tap to Alexa and Alexa Captioning are accessible via the Settings icon on the Amazon Echo Show , found under the Accessibility options . Tap to Alexa is only available on the Amazon Echo Show , but Amazon told CNET that it ’ s investigating the possibility of bringing it to the smaller Amazon Echo Spot , too .

Amazon Prime members , we ’ ve got some news that will be music to your ears , Dolby Atmos is coming to Amazon Prime Video service starting on August 31 . The announcement comes from a Dolby representative who confirmed that Tom Clancy ’ s Jack Ryan will be the first series on Amazon Prime Video in the audio format when it releases in August and you ’ ll be able to stream it in the upgraded audio format on Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV Cube via compatible TVs , sound bars and home theater systems . That means Amazon will be joining services like Netflix and Vudu , both of which offer Dolby Atmos support for dozens of titles , making Prime Video part of a very small group of streaming services to support the format . ( For European readers , Dolby Atmos is offered in Germany via a service called Maxdome . ) Being the third service to offer Atmos is a huge accomplishment , and one that moves the needle forward ever-so-slightly for Dolby Atmos as the default audio format . We were looking forward to streaming Amazon 's latest series , but Dolby Atmos support is icing on the cake . We 've reached out to Dolby to clarify some points - like which other devices will support Dolby Atmos on Amazon Prime Video - and will update this story when we hear back .

If you 're a deals savvy tech buyer , Amazon Prime Day deals imminent arrival in mid July , probably has you eyeing up any deal you see right now with large degree of suspicion and doubt . That little voice whispering 'should I wait for Prime Day for a better deal ? ' is getting louder and louder as the sales event of the summer approaches . And if you 're looking to buy a cheap TV , grab a discounted laptop deal , get a discounted gaming console or bag an Amazon device , we 'd certainly consider waiting to see what Amazon Prime Day has to offer . But mobile phones ? They 're a little different . Read more : Living DNA review While Amazon Prime Day is undeniably going to be the biggest sales event of the year so far , it 's not necessarily something mobile phone retailers get behind with as much vigour as Black Friday and Cyber Monday , or the general October-December seasonal shopping frenzy . It all depends on what sort of mobile phone deal you 're after in all honesty . Contract or an unlocked SIM-free handset deal ? If you 're looking for a new contract , there probably wo n't be anything to look forward to on Prime Day in particular . Amazon do n't do contracts for a start , but we 've not traditionally seen mobile contract sellers ' websites ( both the networks or stores like Mobiles.co.uk ) run any special promotions to cash-in on Prime Day in the same way retailers like Argos and Walmart do in the UK and US respectively . On the bright side , this does n't actually mean you have to wait for Black Friday as we 're actually seeing some extremely competitive contract prices right now on the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S9 ( and some outrageously cheap prices on the older S8 too ) , the brand new Huawei P20 and P20 Pro , and the Google Pixel 2 and the XL also . Prices have been so good lately on these models , we 've been happy to recommend them over waiting for Black Friday . It 's been a different story for the iPhone X deals and even the iPhone 8 where prices have been stubbornly high all year . In their case we would advise waiting for a better contract offer around November time . Do n't forget , if your contract is running out soon , but you 're not ready to sign a new one you could always get a rolling 30-day SIM only deal to tide you over - it 's what we do while waiting for that perfect deal . If you 're keeping things simple and would prefer to buy a phone outright with a SIM-free unlocked handset , there 's a better chance Amazon Prime Day will have something for you , although we do n't expect a huge selection . Last year , Amazon knocked a big chunk off the price of a few of its Wileyfox budget smartphones . And we recall some of the Moto G phones getting discounts at Amazon in recent times too . With a larger amount of third-party retailers set to unleash discounts on Amazon Prime Day 2018 , we 're cautiously optimistic a few more premium flagship handsets will be available at a discounted price . We regularly see Amazon sellers have the cheapest prices for unlocked versions of the Galaxy S9 , Note 8 and even the iPhone X , so if you 're thinking of buying any of those models outright , you might as well wait just-in-case a better deal is waiting in the wings for the sale . In all honesty though , we think it 's the slightly older generations of those lines that are more likely to get a promotional price for Prime Day . That and newer entries like the mid-tier Moto G6 are solid candidates for a discount . So that 's our two cents on mobile phone buying advice for Amazon Prime Day . To sum up again , if you 're after a contract , you might not need to wait as the deals on many phones ( Apple aside ) are strong right now . If you want to buy an unlocked phone , you might have better luck by waiting for something on Prime Day . We 'll all be keeping our fingers crossed for certain items in the sale as per usual . If you want to stay updated on the latest deals you might want to slap a bookmark on some our suggested pages below .

Amazon is expanding its checkout-free shopping stores with a second US opening . The new Amazon Go store was revealed by Geekwire as part of a new office tower in the company 's home city of Seattle , about a mile away from Amazon headquarters . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 An eagle-eyed fan spotted Amazon Go branding in a window gap , with stacked shelves and a smart design suggesting that the store is apparently nearing completion Amazon confirmed the new store in a statement , saying “ We are excited to bring Amazon Go to 920 5th Avenue in Seattle . The store will open in Fall 2018 . ” The new store is almost twice as large as the original Amazon Go , which opened earlier this year , measuring in at around 3,000 square feet - meaning more room for a wider selection of products . Amazon had confirmed that it was looking to expand Go across the US as it looks to take on bricks-and-mortar stores , with San Francisco and Chicago earmarked for the next launches . The news follows Amazon 's acquisition of Whole Foods last year , giving it an entry into the grocery market , as it looks to offer more than its traditional online shopping experience .

It ’ s scarily easy for people to hijack drones using malicious AI . If Amazon wants to go forward with worldwide drone deliveries for Amazon Prime Air , it needs to ensure that its autonomous hardware – and your packages – don ’ t get stolen mid-flight . Read more : Devialet Phantom Reactor 900 review Thankfully , a recent US patent shows that Amazon takes these safety concerns seriously . It outlines design and software features for “ detecting and recovering from hostile takeovers ” from “ nefarious individuals ” hoping to redirect or crash its UAVs . With this proposed safety system , Amazon drones in flight would receive a “ heartbeat ” signal from the controller tower to the drone every couple of seconds . If the drone expects but doesn ’ t receive the next heartbeat , it will immediately transition from mission mode to safety mode . Safety mode , which seems kind of like your smartphone ’ s airplane mode , ensures no outside signals can influence the drone ’ s behavior , until it either reestablishes direct communication with an Amazon controller or finds somewhere safe to land . In fact , as the proposed drones fly , they would use cameras to scan their surroundings , looking for safe places to land in an emergency , such as a vacant lot or mown field . Of course , if Amazon has any kind of Wi-Fi or cloud problems that cause its controllers to go offline , then all of its outgoing drones could end up parking in random fields with your packages until Amazon fixes the issue . Amazon ’ s engineers have a ton of patented ideas for their drones , some more outlandish than others . But we 're getting a clearer idea of which ones could end up actually getting used . Confirming another patent found last year , the drone schematics in this patent make room for a parachute for slowing your package ’ s descent . It didn ’ t make any mention of the self-destruct function discussed in another patent . Perhaps this new safety system made that idea nonessential . The final version of the company ’ s delivery drones could support facial and gesture recognition for communicating with customers during package delivery . Or , Amazon could choose to rely on dropping parachutes to keep its drones far away from humans and potential accidents . Amazon has also patented “ drone towers ” that look like hives . They could be placed in city centers as a docking and recharge port for its drones . These drones could then take off and fly around the city , recharging electric cars—as suggested in another recent patent . Considering Amazon just invested in 100 Mercedes-Benz EV delivery vans , this proposed use could work directly into Amazon ’ s future schemes . Of course , it could turn out that none of these features end up in the finished product ; plenty of patents end up unused by Amazon all the time , including its plans to secretly record you to create personalized ads . But out of all of these ideas , making drones hack-proof seems like the most viable idea to pursue further . Via Digital Trends

Your Amazon Prime Day goodies could be arriving at your door by electric van in the future , after Mercedes-Benz announced the sale of 100 of its eVito electric vans to Amazon Logistics . The vans will deploy within Amazon ’ s fleet sometime in 2019 . The eVito has a range of 100 to 150 kilometers ( 62 to 93 miles ) before needing a recharge , depending on use conditions . Primarily designed for urban environments , the eVito could be a great fit for Amazon , which tends to locate its distribution centers close to major cities . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 It takes six hours to fully charge the eVito 's three 41kWh batteries , and it can hit top speeds of 80-120 km/h ( 50-75 mph ) while carrying a maximum payload of 1,073kg ( 2,366lbs ) , depending on how you configure the engine to save or test the battery life . Mercedes claims its electric vans are “ less expensive than diesel in the long run ” , as the front-loaded cost for batteries will be “ offset by lower energy and maintenance costs ” . Lower distribution costs may factor more into Amazon ’ s investment into EVs than environmental concerns . High-end fashion manufacturer Hermés has also bought into Mercedes ’ pilot eVito program . Both Hermés and Amazon Logistics will test their vans in the German cities of Bochum and Düsseldorf , so you won ’ t see them in the US or UK just yet . Mercedes also announced the eSprinter , the big brother to the eVito . The eSprinter ’ s max distance , speed and payload are nearly identical to the eVito ’ s , except with 10.5 m3 max cargo volume , compared to six m3 . The German automaker has plenty of other futuristic projects in the works , including an AI-powered car , support for virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant , and autonomous drone delivery . Amazon isn ’ t the only major distributor to jump onto the EV bandwagon . UPS recently bought 35 electric trucks to test in Paris and London . Ride-sharing companies are also buying into adding electric cars to their fleets . Uber just announced it would provide “ monetary incentives ” to drivers willing to purchase and use EVs for transporting passengers . And Zipcar just added 300 VW e-Golfs to its fleet in London . Yet if Amazon fully buys into EVs for a good portion of its deliveries , and other distributors follow its lead , global emissions could be significantly impacted for the better . Via Engadget

The Lenovo Smart Essentials range has launched at IFA 2018 in Berlin , Germany , and it 's looking to take over as the brains of your smart home . Initially the family of smart home products is made up of three devices ; Smart Plug , Smart Camera and Smart Bulb . You 'll probably be able to guess what each one does from their names . Lenovo 's already announced Smart Display is also compatible with this new range , and it can act as a hub for the firm 's new smart devices . They 're all controlled from your smartphone using the same app - Lenovo Link - and you can opt to group devices together for easier automation of certain areas and rooms of your home . There 's support for both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa too , allowing you to control the smart home devices with your voice . There are already a number of products that offer a similar experience to Lenovo 's new range - including Nest , Philips and Amazon - which means it has its work cut out when it comes to making in-roads into this rapidly developing market . Lenovo 's Smart Essentials range will go on sale in the US this November starting with the Bulb and Plug , while the Camera is expected to arrive in early 2019 . The devices will come to more markets , likely early near year , including Europe , the Middle East and Africa .

Amazon Prime Video is already one of the cheapest subscription-based streaming services currently available , but it appears that the online retail giant is gearing up to do you one better , with a report from The Information stating that Bezos and Co. are planning to launch a new service for the price of 'absolutely free ' . The service , said to be called Free Dive , will reportedly embrace an ad-supported revenue model , offering the streaming service directly to Fire TV owners at no cost . According to the report , Free Dive will feature mostly older TV shows and movies , and is being developed by Amazon-owned online movie database IMDb . Though an ad-supported version of Amazon Prime Video has been rumored in the past , Free Dive will apparently not be a free version of the Netflix competitor , but an entirely different service with a separate content library . The Free Dive service can be seen as yet another example of Amazon 's current focus on generating ad revenue – the company already hosts a number of ad-supported shows on IMDb , and it was recently announced that the Amazon-owned Twitch Prime won ’ t support ad-free viewing for much longer .

Amazon 's previously top-end , high-spec Kindle Voyage has now disappeared from the official retailer 's site , so now you can only buy refurbished versions of the premium reader . The website notes the `` item is only available from third-party sellers '' plus the retailer has told TechCrunch “ that customer response to Kindle Voyage has been incredibly positive and we ’ ve sold out . ” Exactly what that means for the Kindle Voyage line remains to be seen . It may be the company is readying itself for a new version of the ereader to be released so is selling through the last of its stock . It 's perhaps just as likely the company has decided to drop the line of ereaders from its collection of Kindle devices , seeing as it 's since been superseded by the Kindle Oasis . Currently the lineup of ereaders in price order from the company are the Kindle , Kindle Paperwhite , Kindle Voyage and Kindle Oasis . The Kindle Voyage was introduced in 2014 as the high-spec bookworm-friendly device , but it has always felt odd to keep it around since the even higher-end Kindle Oasis was introduced in 2016 . The Kindle Voyage has arguably been redundant in the range since the end of 2016 when the Oasis came to market , and the fact we 're on generation 2 of the Oasis product it feels like the company is ultimately focusing on that range in the future . If you 're desperate to get a Kindle Voyage before this iteration at least is properly discontinued , you 'll have to head over to some third-party retailers to find it .

Amazon already makes several devices to plug into the back of your TV set , but there 's apparently another one on the way : a DVR device for recording live TV that will let you catch up on your favorite shows whenever you 've got time . Bloomberg reports that the device , codenamed Frank , will have local storage space as well as connecting to streaming players including the Amazon Fire TV . The same wireless tech that 's built into the Amazon Echo range of speakers will also be built into whatever Frank turns out to be , according to an inside source . Read more : I-box Century review As well as recording shows and movies , the upcoming box will also be able to then send that content to smartphones and other devices , the report says – putting it in competition with the likes of Sling TV and TiVo . In what is already a very crowded space , the Amazon Frank would be another box for getting content up on your big screen . Whether it would also have the same apps and capabilities as a Fire TV device remains to be seen . With many apps and services now streaming content straight from the cloud , we 'll have to wait and see how much appetite there is for a new device that saves video to a disk instead . YouTube TV , for example , includes a DVR component for saving shows , but works entirely in the cloud with no extra hardware required . The insider source also told Bloomberg that an update is on the way for the Fire TV Stick , though there are n't any more details on that just yet . It sounds as though Amazon is far from finished when it comes to invading your living room .

Amazon is looking into establishing a price comparison website for insurance plans , a new report states . According to Reuters , the company is in talks with several insurance companies in the UK , with it thought that Amazon is looking to expand into the lucrative motor and home insurance policy market . Read more : I-box Century review With Amazon already positioning itself as the go-to online retailer for many entertainment goods , and increasingly upping its presence in the home services market with its grocery sales and security products , insurance is a smart addition to the entire 'life through Amazon ' package . Though there are no immediate plans to launch the site , any such launch would put Amazon in competition with established players such as GoCompare and Compare the Market . Comparison websites are one of the leading ways that insurers such as AXA and Hastings find their custom , and with Amazon 's Prime membership base very loyal to the service it 's likely it would prove popular for those that want to maintain all subscriptions under one umbrella . Amazon , having already offered warranty extensions and co-branded credit cards , would in fact not be the first tech company to offer such insurance services . In 2016 Google ran a short-lived comparison service in the UK and US , but it lasted just a year due to a lack of consumer interest .

Earlier this year , older Amazon Fire TV models were overtaken by a malicious worm that spread from between devices using the set-top box 's ADB ( Android Debug Bridge ) connection . Today , Amazon has released a patch that will plug the hole in the vulnerability and stop the infection in its tracks . The software update – version 5.2.6.6 – is now available for Amazon Fire TV , Amazon Fire TV Stick and Amazon Fire TV Edition televisions , and it 'll disable ADB by default . It 'll also prompt users every time a device wants to install a new piece of software on their device . In the past , once you approved one ADB connection , any device could then connect to your Fire TV and install some code without asking . The offending exploit from February helped spread a pretty vicious malware worm called ADB.miner and the unchecked vulnerability of Amazon Fire TVs was used to mine cryptocurrency . This caused massive slow downs on infected devices , leading to long install times and abrupt crashing in the middle of streamed content . The silver lining in all this is that newer devices , like the Amazon Fire TV Cube and latest version of the Amazon Fire TV , weren ’ t impacted by the malware as the protocol of asking before installing any software was built in from the start . This all raises the question : If ADB is such a vulnerability , why even allow it to exist on Amazon Fire TV devices ? The answer is that ADB gives users some customizability options for their Fire TV – allowing you to install apps that are n't available on Amazon 's limited Fire TV store ( called sideloading ) . Sideloading is most often used by the KODI/XMBC crowd to install the app on the Fire TV , creating an even more robust streaming device that can stream local video content as well as content from traditional sources like Netflix and Amazon Video . Now that the ADB vulnerability is fixed , you 'll be prompted before any additional software is installed on the device , quashing bugs like ADB.miner in its tracks . Source : AFTVnews

Have you ever purchased something using just your voice with an Amazon Echo and the Alexa voice assistant ? If the answer to that question is 'no ' , you 're not alone – and even if you answered 'yes ' , the stats suggest you never tried it again . That 's according to a report in The Information that states that , despite the 50 million estimated Alexa-enabled devices out in the wild , `` only about 2 % of the people with devices [ ... ] have made a purchase with their voices so far in 2018 '' . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 The numbers come from a pair of insiders who have been briefed on Amazon 's internal figures , which we 've run through in more detail below . If true , that 's a far smaller number of voice-activated shoppers than previous third party reports have estimated . Of those that did make a purchase , around 90 % were said to have never tried it again . A more healthy 20 % did however make use of shopping-related requests of Alexa , such as to ask about current deals or to track the status of an order . Engagement with Alexa remains high , but this seems mostly centred around the assistant 's Skills set – the commands that can answer questions , playback media , set timers and reminders and more . So what could be holding Amazon 's potentially-lucrative Alexa sales back ? As far as product comparison goes ( which Amazon 's website does very well ) , audio-only feedback on an item is n't as reassuring as seeing a product on a screen in front of you . That 's before the ability to scan user reviews comes into the equation or , more pertinently perhaps , the ability to compare prices with shops outside of the Amazon ecosystem . Alexa can really only return one response at a time , and they 're all from Amazon 's shop – it can be easy to fear that the wrong item has been ordered , or that Alexa is pushing an item with promotional value for Amazon , rather than for the user . In response to the report , Amazon stated that “ millions of customers use Alexa to shop because it is the most convenient way to capture needs in the moment . '' “ We want to enable customers to shop in whatever way is easiest for them . ” The Amazon Echo Show , with its built in screen , could alleviate this worry somewhat – but with a smartphone app to hand almost anywhere an Alexa is , it 's unlikely you 'd choose to spend your money with a relatively unproven shopping medium rather than your phone .

“ Amazon haes hud another stoatin ’ idea ” is what you might be saying right now if you speak English with a Scottish accent , because if you have a particularly heavy accent that means people sometimes find it hard to understand you , Amazon ’ s latest stoatin ’ idea could help . The company has just patented an audio system that can detect the accent of a speaker and translate it into the accent of the listener , which could have major implications not only for voice-activated technology like Amazon 's Echo range , but also for how we interact with each other globally . Read more : Travis Touch Plus The technology is designed to enable people with different accents to communicate with each other more easily . The patent describes a bank of stored accents , against which the speaker ’ s voice is compared and matched . Once the accent is correctly identified , the translator converts the speech into the accent of the listener in real time , allowing the conversation to flow smoothly . Real-time translation apps like Google Translate are already used regularly by around 500 million people per month , with recent updates including image translations and real-time voice-to-text translation . The new patent from Amazon could prove useful for the millions of people worldwide who regularly speak a second or third language , but who might struggle when communicating with someone who speaks with a different accent . Many users are still reporting problems with voice-activated assistants like the Amazon Echo , Google Home , and Apple Homepod recognizing strong accents , so Amazon ’ s patent could well be an attempt to address such bugs . However , a patent application is no guarantee the new technology will ultimately be rolled out . It could be that Amazon has filed a ‘ defensive ’ patent to stop competitors from getting there first , or is simply carrying out research . That said , better voice activation technology for people with strong accents would be absolutely 'barrie'* . *good .
Rumors have been swirling ahead of Samsung ’ s Galaxy Note 9 launch about a wireless charging pad known as the Duo , and now Amazon has all but confirmed this unreleased product . As the name should imply , the Samsung Wireless Charger Duo is capable of charging two devices simultaneously , whether that ’ s the upcoming Note 9 and Galaxy Watch , or a pair of older mobile devices like the wireless charging-capable Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S9 . In a press preview event attended by Gizmodo , Amazon put a device on display that looks identical to the current leaked image of the Duo , although it was labelled here as the Samsung Qi Pad ( 2018 ) and its associated QR code linked to Samsung ’ s standard single charging pad . What appears to be the Samsung Duo has a single USB-C connection and twin indicator lights to show each device ’ s charging status . One half of the unit retains the same angular disc design of the original Samsung Qi Pad , which presumably was intended to be displayed here instead of the Duo . Gizmodo found the device to have an input rating of 12V and 2.1A but , apart from that , there were few details on show . If you ’ re keen to check out more images , head over to Sam Rutherford ’ s article on Gizmodo . We expect all will be revealed when the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is revealed on August 9 , so stay tuned for all the juicy Galaxy news .

Artificially-intelligent digital assistants like Apple ’ s Siri , Amazon ’ s Alexa and the Google Assistant are slowly but surely taking over the world , appearing in myriad devices ranging from phones to speakers to TVs to cars and , as of last week , even kitchen appliances like microwaves . If you ’ re a frequent user of any of the above assistants , though , there ’ s likely one feature you 'll have wished for at various times and in certain situations – the ability for them to be a bit more discrete . Read more : I-box Century review Now Amazon has provided more details on its plans to address that need by enhancing Alexa 's ability to understand whispered speech . The upcoming feature , which was first announced last week alongside the company ’ s range of new Echo devices , means that when Alexa detects a user whispering , the assistant will automatically reply in a lower-volume , hushed tone . The feature is coming to the US market first , and will be available beginning in October . According to Zeynab Raeesy , a speech scientist working on Amazon ’ s Alexa Speech team , “ Whispered speech is predominantly unvoiced , meaning that it doesn ’ t involve the vibration of the vocal cords , and it has less energy in lower frequency bands than ordinary speech . ” That meant that to enable the new capabilities , the team had to make adjustments to the way sound was processed after being captured , and they ’ re planning to present a paper on their findings at the IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology in December . With Google , Amazon and Apple all hoping that voice assistants will be a huge market for growth , adding whisper support to speech recognition technologies makes a lot of sense . It gives users the ability to use assistants more discretely and should , theoretically , help people feel more comfortable about using voice control in a much wider range of environments – like when you ’ re out in public , at the office or school , or perhaps just trying to avoid waking up that sleeping kitty on your lap . Of course , better contextual awareness also has the potential to make AI assistants seem a bit more human , too – although whether you see that as a pro or con will probably depend on your general feelings towards this burgeoning age of artificial intelligence . We for one welcome our new digital overlords , and we 're looking forward to the day when we can sneak out of bed for a midnight snack , and quietly whisper ” Alexa , warm up this slice of chocolate cake ” to the microwave without disturbing the rest of the household .

If you love that classic combination of travel , board games , and smart speakers , the round-the-world trivia game , When In Rome , could be the perfect post-dinner activity to whip out next time you have friends over . Developed by Voice Originals , the game works with Amazon Alexa , so you will need an Alexa-powered device like the Amazon Echo to play , which we used to test it out . To get going , you will also need to enable the free When In Rome skill in the Alexa app . Read more : I-box Century review In the box you ’ ll find a world map board , player tokens , ‘ friend ’ tokens , ‘ upgrade cards ’ , and five ‘ souvenir ’ objects – all of which is helpfully explained by Alexa as you play , so you never feel unsure about how to play . When In Rome is available on Amazon at a reduced price in the US of $ 19.99 , but is still at full price in the UK and Australia for £24.99 and around AU $ 43 , respectively . Whether you consider this to be good value for money really depends on how much use you ’ re likely to get out of it – for us it was more of a one off novelty , but if you have kids or have friends round for dinner regularly , it may be a smart purchase . If you ’ re not a fan of reading through rule books , you ’ ll probably appreciate the fact that Alexa guides you through the entire process , meaning you can kick back and enjoy the game without arguing over opposing interpretations of the rulebook . The game is designed for two teams of between two and four player , but we found it worked just fine with just two players if you ’ re having a couples night in . To start the game simply say ‘ Alexa , open When In Rome ’ , and you ’ ll be prompted to get into your teams and select a team token . One fun feature is that the first turn of each round is determined by a head-to-head question , meaning the stakes are high from the get go . Then , you can start your adventure with a destination of your choice – we started in San Francisco , where a real local asks you a trivia question about the city . With every question your team answers correctly , you can earn a ‘ friend ’ in that city , preventing the opposing team from doing the same and creating easier connections so that you can get around the map and earn more points . Some cities have special ‘ souvenirs , ’ which you can claim if you answer that city ’ s trivia question correctly – an they 're worth more points than correct questions alone . The more souvenirs you can get your hands on , the more likely your team is to win . The game is over after twelve rounds , or when every souvenir has been found . Although issues with the voice recognition element of the Amazon Echo could have made this experience extremely stressful , we found it couldn ’ t have gone smoother , and in fact , any time Alexa didn ’ t pick up our voices just added to the hilarity of it all . Not having to read through a rule book was really refreshing , and it was great to sit back and let Alexa guide us through the game – although at times it did feel like the game was ‘ over ’ explained and it was sometimes frustrating to sit through the long explanations at the beginning of the game . We found the questions to be a great mix of the kind of general knowledge most players will be able to answer , and more left-field questions that required a bit more thinking . With multiple choice answers it didn ’ t feel too difficult , and we think children will enjoy this just as much as adults . We loved how Alexa was able to lead us through the game , giving less instruction as we became more comfortable with the rules – although small children may become bored by the amount of listening required . Having the questions read out by real locals was a nice touch as well , making the game feel super interactive and authentic , with each local speaking in a regional accent and discussing what it ’ s like to live in their city . Overall , playing When In Rome was a really fun experience – silly enough to be entertaining , but with questions cerebral enough to actually give you a decent challenge .

Amazon has long been known for putting good things in small packages . That was the basis of its shopping model , and that philosophy has made it all the way to the latest batch of devices like the Amazon Echo Dot and brand-new Amazon Echo Input . Starting later this year , you can add a new device to the ‘ small but mighty ’ category : the Amazon Echo Auto . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 This device promises to pack Alexa into the car or truck at a price most folks can afford and , when it arrives , you ’ ll be able to access all of Alexa ’ s some 50,000 skills wherever you go – make calls with Alexa and use your favorite streaming music services via voice commands wherever the road takes you . ( And yes , that includes routines as well . ) Like the original Amazon Echo , the Echo Auto will be available on an invite-only basis starting in the US and sold for a discount price – just $ 24.99 ( roughly £19 , AU $ 34 ) . That price will increase to $ 49.99 after the invite-only period ends but that ’ s still a mighty good deal for what you get . What you get , exactly , is a portable Echo that uses a Bluetooth connection to your phone and an eight-microphone array to take requests via Alexa and can spit out songs , directions , your to-do list , a book from Audible and more . The way it works is that the device uses a road noise-reduction algorithm to eliminate driving noise and , after all that excess noise is cut out , the Auto proceeds to send requests from the device to your phone which is responsible for connecting to the internet . The Auto can be powered in one of two ways , either via your car ’ s 12V power outlet or a regular USB port , if you drive something reasonably modern . To get the music and directions to play through your car ’ s stereo system , you can connect the Auto using Bluetooth ( again , if your car ’ s head unit supports it ) or via a simple 3.5mm auxiliary cable . The system , when all setup , offers a poor man ’ s version of Android Auto or Apple CarPlay with some of the added perks of Alexa , like routines and smart home compatibility . Sure , those other two options have a visual component , but the beauty of Amazon Echo Auto is that Amazon is offering an audio-only solution at a fraction of the cost .
Smart home gadgets are great and all , but what if you don ’ t want to buy a whole bunch of new smart light bulbs in order to talk to your light fittings ? What if you wished you could turn off that fan on a hot day without trekking to the other side of the room ? Or set an If This Then That app routine that ’ d ensure you never leave the iron on when your rush out the door for work in the morning ? With the newly-announced Amazon Smart Plug ( set to be available in both US and UK-compatible configurations ) , you ’ ll be able to do all the above with your wall socket-powered gadgets around the home , whether they ’ re smart or not . Read more : I-box Century review The Amazon Smart Plug connects to your home Wi-Fi connection , letting it communicate with your Alexa-powered devices to let any attached electrical devices be controlled via voice alone . You can plug any old lamp , TV , blender or other device into the Amazon Smart Plug ( itself plugged into your standard wall power outlet ) and they can then be turned on or off using Alexa voice controls . Smart plugs are not unique – there are plenty out there that can already interface with Alexa . But the Amazon plug is unique in that it features Wi-Fi simple set-up , which allows an Alexa device to quickly find connected devices on your behalf , and intelligently rename them with voice commands alone . Plug in your bedside lamp , tell Alexa the Amazon Smart Plug is now called “ bedside lamp ” and then when you tell your Echo device to “ turn off bedside lamp ” it ’ ll intelligently turn off the correct gadget without you needing to manually rename a plug individually . With a smart plug then you ’ ll be able to integrate all manner of electrical furnishings into your smart home routines . Walk through the door , say “ Alexa , I ’ m home ” , and you could have the smart plugs react by turning on your TV , a scent diffuser and a fan automatically to put your home in “ my-work-day-is-done ” chill-out mode . Available for pre-order now at £24.99 in the UK and $ 24.99 in the US , the Amazon Smart Plugs look set to be a streamlined way of smartening up even the dumbest of household objects .
In a slew of announcements it was easy to lose track of the Amazon Fire TV Recast – a new DVR device from Amazon that will record shows using an over-the-air ( OTA ) antenna and feed them to you via your Fire TV streaming player , Fire TV Edition flatscreen or Echo Show device . One reason it was so easy to skip over was that Amazon announced both an Alexa-enabled microwave and a Wall Clock a short 10 minutes before the announcement of the Recast and another is that the Fire TV Recast is kind of complicated – it ’ s not really a proper Fire TV device in the way we ’ ve come to understand them . That being said , once you wrap your head around what the Recast can do , it ’ s not an embellishment to say that the Amazon Fire TV Recast could reshape the media landscape , helping cord cutters and cord-nevers leave cable companies behind once and for all . The Recast is an OTA DVR ( over-the-air digital video recorder ) . You plug an HD antenna of your choosing into it , and then simply tell the Recast what you want it to record . Inside , the base $ 230 version of the Recast has two tuners that allow it to record two shows simultaneously and a 500GB hard drive that will store those recordings . ( There ’ s a four-tuner , 1TB version coming later this year for $ 280 . ) To watch what you ’ ve recorded , you ’ ll need a Fire TV device ( a streaming player , a TV or an Amazon Echo Show ) or the unreleased Fire TV app that should arrive when the Recast does on November 14 in the US . ( Amazon hasn ’ t announced UK/AU availability yet , but we ’ ll update this story when and if it does . ) Once the show has been recorded , the DVR can then stream to two devices simultaneously in HD – as long as you have the bandwidth to support it . Of course , you don ’ t necessarily need to record something if it ’ s on TV right now : The Fire TV app will allow for live playback over Wi-Fi or cellular network . That means if you ’ re away from your living room during the next episode of This Is Us , you can simply pull it up on your phone or tablet via the Fire TV app . Speaking of the app , you ’ ll be able to use it to find the perfect location for your OTA antenna based on signal strength . Amazon didn ’ t demo that during our time at their office , but it ’ s a smart idea that we wish had been thought of before . Where this gets slightly confusing is that , despite its Fire TV moniker , the Recast doesn ’ t have any content – or operating system – on the box itself . That means you won ’ t be able to use the Recast to stream shows from Amazon Prime Video or Netflix and it ’ s not meant to replace your existing Amazon Fire TV or Amazon Fire TV Cube . So , why is it called Amazon Fire TV ? Amazon has chosen the moniker , it seems , because the Recast works at its fullest extent when paired with a Fire TV device . When paired , the Recast will add a DVR section to the Amazon Fire TV home screen that will sit alongside the On Now row . It ’ s here you ’ ll be able to find and control your recordings either with the remote or via your voice with some help from Alexa . If you ’ re a PlayStation Vue or Amazon Channels subscriber and use a Fire TV device , the aforementioned On Now row will include shows and movies from those services , and even goes as far as to include them in your channel lineup alongside the OTA content . This integration of OTA content with your existing streaming service is the pièce de résistance of the device , and one that could help Amazon rival traditional cable packages . As we ’ ve said , it ’ s not necessarily a Fire TV device – or at least not in the traditional sense . It won ’ t stream Netflix or Hulu and you won ’ t find games anywhere remotely close to the Recast . It ’ s purely an OTA DVR through and through . The Recast is also not an Echo device . Shout at it all want , Alexa suddenly isn ’ t going to pop up and parse your command ; you ’ re still going to need an Echo if you want Alexa compatibility or a Fire TV Cube if you ’ re looking for a combination of streaming and Alexa . It ’ s also , importantly , not cable : Amazon isn ’ t charging a monthly fee for this service – just buy a device and you ’ re good for a lifetime of OTA DVR streaming . That ’ s a massive departure from any device like it on the market ( at least from mainstream manufacturers ) and puts it closer in line to some PC-based devices like the HDHomeRun and services like PLEX . That said , the Recast also doesn ’ t replace your TiVO , either . Because the Recast is OTA-only , you won ’ t find a slot for a cable card or any way to record cable TV . That could be a problem for people tied to the idea of watching specific shows at specific times – and may make replacing the cable box a bit more of a hassle than it ’ s worth for a certain audience . Whether or not it turns out to be the cable replacement we think it has the potential to be , we ’ ll just have to wait until November to find out .
Amazon wants to put its Alexa voice-controlled AI helper in everything . And when we say everything , we mean everything – not content today with putting out a whole range of new smart speaker equipment with its refreshed Echo range , it ’ s bringing Alexa to some of the most mundane items in your home . As well as an Alexa-equipped microwave , Amazon is introducing a new Echo Wall Clock , that will sync up with your Alexa voice-controlled devices to give you some visual feedback on your timers and reminders . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 On the ( no pun intended ) face of things , the Echo Wall Clock looks like your standard wall-hanging timepiece . It ’ s got a white frame with numerical marking around its circumference for keeping track of time against a charcoal face . Where things get interesting is how it hooks up with Alexa . In addition to the numbers , the circumference features an LED array , marking down the minutes and seconds . Connect the clock to your Echo devices over Bluetooth , and these LEDs light up to show exactly how long is left on a timer , or until a reminder has counted down . It ’ ll even track multiple timers , with notches lighting up at different points around a face to denote different timers that are being tracked . Once a timer has counted down , those LEDs will flash , along with any audio feedback that your Echo speakers produce . A few things to note , however – the Echo Wall Clock can only interact with one Echo device at a time . So if it ’ s hanging in your living room , connected to a living room-based Echo Dot , you wo n't be able to set a timer for it from the Echo Spot sat on your bedroom dresser . It ’ s also powered by two AA batteries , and , with a constant Bluetooth connection being established , we ’ re a little concerned that you ’ ll be pretty regularly changing out those cells . With its subtle looks and simple visual feedback , there ’ s a lot to like about the Echo Wall Clock . For now , it appears to be a US-exclusive , priced at $ 29.99 . But it ’ s a great example of how Alexa can be used to enhance the ambient-yet-useful furnishings that we take for granted around our homes .

At Amazon ’ s event today the company unveiled a raft of new Echo and other Alexa-equipped devices , and one of them is Amazon 's very own Smart Plug , which lets you voice-control anything plugged into it . It ’ s available to pre-order today for $ 25 ( £25 , about AU $ 34 ) and will ship next month . You ’ ll have it well in advance of Christmas and Black Friday . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 Users must choose an Alexa-supporting device , or even just the Alexa app , to link up with the Smart Plug – but at least it doesn ’ t require a smart hub to work . Through their Alexa device , users can create routines for when to turn on whatever ’ s plugged in to it , from lights to fans to coffee makers . In essence , this makes ‘ dumb ’ appliances a bit smarter , letting users vocally set up schedules to activate or deactivate their appliances . It ’ s unclear whether the Smart Plug will get any more functionality than simply choosing when to supply power , meaning you ’ ll have to , say , set up your coffee pot to brew when it ’ s turned on rather then control its myriad options through Alexa . The Smart Plug also only supplies one plug , so don ’ t expect to replace your multi-outlet extenders just yet . We ’ ll have an Amazon Smart Plug review as soon as we get one , plug it in , and shout commands at it . Here 's everything you need to know about some of the other new Amazon devices…
If you ’ ve been digging your Amazon Echo or Amazon Echo Plus speaker for all of its smarts , but find the audio to be lacking , Amazon has a new thing to sell you : the Amazon Echo Sub . This is a subwoofer attachment that enhances the audio of existing Echo and Echo Plus speakers . Amazon just announced the Echo Sub during a surprise September 20 announcement event in its Seattle headquarters . The device works with existing Echo and Echo Plus speakers wirelessly for either a 1.1 improvement with a single speaker or with two speakers wirelessly , amplifying both of their audio and turning it into a 2.1 setup . Read more : I-box Century review This is a relatively new concept for smart speaker owners , so we ’ ve broken down all of the major details regarding Amazon Echo Sub , namely when it ’ s out , how much it costs and just what in the world it does . Everyone is open to begin pre-ordering the Echo Sub starting today at the time of writing . However , the product doesn ’ t begin shipping in the US and Australia until later this month , and wo n't be generally available on October 11 . We 'll update this story once we learn more regarding UK pre-order and shipping details . Regardless , expect to see these in friends and family members ' homes – assuming it sells well – by the end of the month or early October . It 's sure to be a staple of this year 's Black Friday sales . The Amazon Echo Sub calls for $ 129 in the US and £119 in the UK , while it carries a price tag of $ 199 in Australia . This is a surprisingly steep price for a device that simply amplifies the audio power of existing Echo speakers . We 'll have to see by just how much this product boosts audio in a full review . The Amazon Echo Sub does n't have a ton of specific features to speak of . Most importantly , this is a 100W subwoofer with wireless communication capabilities . This allows the Sub to receive audio data from the Echo speakers that would otherwise pump out of those speakers ' built-in woofers . The result should be far more powerful bass response from the Echo speakers when playing music .
If you 've complained about Alexa 's inability to answer a question recently , we 've got some good news : Alexa 's about to get a massive update . In an event today at Amazon 's Seattle headquarters , the company announced a slew of updates to its infamous smart assistant – and a whole load of new devices that go way beyond smart speakers . Read more : I-box Century review The presentation began with David Limp , VP of Alexa at Amazon , announcing a sequel to the Amazon Echo Dot that will ship for the same price – $ 49.99 ( £49.99 / AU $ 79 ) . There 's also the Amazon Echo Input , which will cost just $ 34.99 ( £34.99 ) , and which removes the speaker from the Dot and focuses on voice input . To enhance the audio of existing Amazon speakers , there 's Amazon Echo Sub – a subwoofer that pairs with Echo speakers , and which leaked yesterday – the Echo Link Amp and Amazon Echo Link , which add Alexa voice control to your existing audio setup . Read our first impressions of the some of the new Amazon devices : The Echo Sub costs $ 129.99 / £119.99 / AU $ 199 , and will be available in every country Alexa is in . It 's available for pre-order now , while the Link Amp and Link will be available for $ 299 and $ 199 in the US later this year and some time next year , respectively – we do n't yet know about availability for other regions . To accompany the new music devices , Amazon is updating its Music service to include release notifications that will alert you when a new album drops . On top of that , there 's going to be a new version of the Amazon Echo Plus that will start shipping next month for $ 149.99 / £139.99 / AU $ 229 . What about your domestic devices that are n't smart already ? For those 'dumb ' devices , Amazon has introduced the Smart Plug ( $ 25 / £24.99 ) that will enable every device in the home to have at least some limited smart home functionality . To finish the presentation , Amazon announced a new version of the Amazon Echo Show , which will have better sound ( thanks to Dolby processing ) and two times the display area of the original Echo Show . It will also include web browsers ( both Silk and Firefox ) . The 2018 Echo Show is $ 229 ( £219.99 / AU $ 349 ) , and will also have an accompanying stand that will allow you to tilt the device to adjust the viewing and camera angles for an additional £29.99 . Both are available for pre-order today and will begin shipping next month . Two of the stranger products Amazon announced today were the Amazon Basics Alexa Microwave and Echo Wall Clock . The Wall Clock is really an extension of Alexa 's widely used timer feature . It will have an LED for timers which can tick down when it ’ s close to zero , and flashes when a timer is done . That will be $ 29.99 in the US and ships later this year . The Amazon Basics Alexa Microwave works with connected devices as well as having a regular interface , and can connect to a nearby Echo . It has Dash replenishment for popcorn , and an Ask Alexa button that you can tap and tell the microwave what ’ s cooking ( e.g . “ 1 potato ” ) . That 's $ 59.99 , shipping later this year . Again we do n't know when these devices will be available outside the US . Alexa is getting two updates , one that focuses on software and one on hardware . Alexa Hunches will be aware of things you may want to do contextually . If you say , “ Alexa Goodnight ” , for example , Alexa may warn you that you ’ ve left the smart lock on your door unlocked , or a smart light on . Alexa Connect Kit , on the other hand , lets manufacturers add a module with Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi to appliances of all types . There ’ s a real-time operating system in there too for updates and contextual awareness . One of the most exciting products announced during the keynote was the Fire TV Recast , an Amazon DVR that includes two tuners and a 500GB hard drive for $ 229.99 . A four-tuner 1TB version also on the way , and the Recast is set to pose a major threat to TiVo in the US . The Recast lets you send broadcast TV recordings to Fire TV devices , Android mobile and Echo Show , can be placed anywhere in your home for best aerial reception , and can beam content over Wi-Fi . It will add a DVR panel to Fire TV devices when installed , and will integrate with cable streaming services like PlayStation Vue . So far , Alexa has invaded the kitchen , the living room and most of the walls on your home . But what about your car ? Amazon has a device for that . It 's called the Amazon Echo Auto , and features eight mics inside . The Echo Auto is able to differentiate between road noise , entertainment , voice and more , and has a dash mount so you can use it hands-free ( not even Alexa can talk its way out of a ticket ) . The Echo Auto is built from a new real-time operating system , booting as soon as your ignition is turned . The device features Bluetooth and Aux connections , with the phone in your car used to route queries to the cloud . Alexa will also be location-aware , allowing you to pull up to your house and immediately turn smart lights on . We 'll be bringing you more news from Amazon 's launch event , plus our hands-on first impressions of some of the new devices , so keep checking back here .
It was only a couple of days ago that we learnt Amazon was planning on launching eight new Alexa -powered devices this year . Now two of those have been accidentally revealed by the retail juggernaut itself . Discovered by Pocket-lint and since taken down , the Amazon Echo Sub wireless subwoofer and a smart plug made a brief appearance , along with images and pricing , on Amazon ’ s UK website . Read more : I-box Century review Both devices are a first for Amazon and confirms at least part of the CNBC report on the eight potential new products , which also included a microwave . The CNBC report revealed that a high-end home audio system was on the cards , which would include an amplifier , a receiver and a subwoofer . We now know that the subwoofer is called the Amazon Echo Sub that was listed for a price of £75 ( about $ 99 / AU $ 135 ) . According to the features list on the screenshot taken by Pocket-lint , the 6-inch connected subwoofer has Alexa built-in and adds 100W of bass to the Echo range of smart speakers , with the ability to link it to a pair of speakers for stereo sound . The Amazon Smart Plug , however , was listed for a whopping £95 ( $ 125 / AU $ 172 ) , which puts this particular product in the ‘ high-end ’ category as opposed to the subwoofer . If that price is correct , it would be one of the most expensive smart plugs on the market , with nothing to indicate there ’ s anything special about it except adding Alexa voice control to any power socket . The Smart Plug looks like a standard offering ; users will be able to plug any ordinary gadget into it and be able to start them up , or turn them off , by a simple voice command , or use the Alexa app to set up routines . For example , you can have an ordinary lamp turn on when you ’ re about to head home from work and get the kettle boiling as well . Given the price of the Smart Plug is most definitely incorrect , we ’ d recommend taking the price of the subwoofer with a grain of salt as well . However , the accidental leaks revealed that the new products will be available from 11 October , so we don ’ t have long to go before we know for sure .

In case there weren ’ t too many Alexa devices in your life already , Amazon has released an Alexa Gadgets Toolkit to help even more developers make Alexa-compatible products . The Alexa Gadgets Toolkit is currently in beta , but looks to build on the ever-growing network of appliances now able to interact with Amazon ’ s ubiquitous smart assistant . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 Most collaborative third-party products so far have been in the home audio sector , twinning Alexa ’ s smarts with high-end audio credentials you can ’ t find in the average Amazon Echo – like in the premium Sonos One speaker . The toolkit is likely to see Alexa spread across more casual , low-end devices . Amazon picks out cuckoo clocks and singing fish ornaments as products ripe for the Alexa revolution . Whether we need Alexa in every domestic appliance and discarded novelty gift is unclear , but you can bet your bottom dollar it ’ s happening . While the potential applications are broad , Amazon singles out the following starting points for budding Alexa developers to include : Since first launching the first-generation Amazon Echo in 2015 , Amazon has shifted millions of Alexa-enabled devices around the world . So it ’ s no surprise that third-party manufacturers are keen to get a slice of the AI pie . Earlier this week , reports emerged suggesting the retail juggernaut was expanding its in-house Alexa range with a further eight smart home devices , with official announcements to come in the coming weeks . The new devices are rumored to include an Alexa-powered microwave and some form of Alexa gadget for your car . The Echo range may also ramp up its audio credentials with a high-end home audio system with an AV receiver and subwoofer .

Most manufacturers of consumer electronics follow a yearly cycle of releasing new products – if smartphone makers can do it , why not Amazon ? In fact , around this time last year , Amazon launched its Echo Spot smart speaker , so it comes as no surprise that the online shopping giant is gearing up to announce eight new Alexa-enabled smart home devices , according to CNBC . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 CNBC reports that Amazon is expected to officially reveal the new devices at an event to be held later this month , with a microwave amongst the potential gadgets . According to the report , the devices are wide-ranging but details are sparse – other than the aforementioned microwave , we could potentially see the launch of an automotive gadget and a high-end home audio set which would include an amplifier , a receiver and a subwoofer . If these new devices are launched , it would be Amazon ’ s first foray into the home appliances market , and will place it in direct competition with the likes of Sonos , GE and Garmin who already offer Alexa-enabled products for the home and car . The release of the new devices also builds into Amazon ’ s plans for making Alexa a quintessential part of a smart home setup . In July , CEO Jeff Bezos said , “ We want customers to be able to use Alexa wherever they are . '' `` There are now tens of thousands of developers across more than 150 countries building new devices using the Alexa Voice Service , '' Bezos added in the July earnings report , `` and the number of Alexa-enabled devices has more than tripled in the past year . '' However , as The Verge points out , the CNBC report doesn ’ t mention if the new devices will be Echo branded or not , leaving room for Amazon to work on making Alexa a brand name .

“ The true center of the smart home ? I don ’ t think that ’ s something we need to debate . What unlocks all of it is voice . ” Daniel Rausch , Vice President , Smart Home , at Amazon is confident speaking to TechRadar before his recent big keynote at IFA 2018 . Rausch has been chosen by Europe ’ s big tech show to talk about all things smart home and it ’ s something that Amazon knows all about . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 Since Alexa ’ s arrival - Amazon ’ s voice assistant - we have seen homes turn from dumb to smart , at a low cost , to the point where some 50 million people have access to voice control ( whichever your OS preference ) in the US . This has happened in just “ three and change ” years , according to Rausch , who remembers not-so-long ago when the smart home was very different . “ The so-called smart home was a segment that was taking off for decades . Starting in the 1980s with the X10 [ home automation protocol ] , ” notes Rausch . `` The sea change of the simplicity of voice control with Alexa means a faster pace of adoption . '' “ More recently , before the simplicity of voice control , it was your phone . But that turned out to be for just one person in the house . “ You would have to unlock your phone , go through the mess of apps , find the right one , open it , find the right device and then you would turn on the light bulb . You could have just walked across the room and tapped the switch . “ It wasn ’ t easy for customers , ” he admits . “ The sea change of the simplicity of voice control with Alexa means a faster pace of adoption because it is actually easier . It is the same across the whole heterogeneous range of devices and it is just that easy . That was the key pivot that unlocked the smart home . ” That range of devices has proliferated in the last year . According to Rausch , over 50 products were announced at IFA - either with Alexa built in ( Alexa-enabled products ) or products Alexa can control - and the diverse spread was telling . There were Alexa-integrated PCs , lights , fridges ... and even some speakers . “ It took us three years to get to 4,000 Alexa-compatible devices , ” said Rausch . “ Within the last nine months that number has gone from 9,000 to 20,000 . ” The sheer amount of new product has meant that Amazon has had to have a robust system for getting manufacturers on board , and fast . “ We ’ ve created software development kits , hardware development kits , microphone arrays , give different options for supply chain partners , ODMs , different tiers in the supply chain , ” reveals Rausch . “ There ’ s an equal amount of effort going into making it easier for Alexa to control products , too . “ We have got technology like our smart home APIs that allow Alexa to interface with many products for our customers . That ’ s experience huge growth as well . ” The speed of concept to product was highlighted recently and the fruits of this was showcased at IFA . “ There is a great story about an Anker product that was accelerated to seven months ’ delivery [ Anker announced a number of Alexa-integrated devices at IFA 2018 ] . That ’ s from the first concept , the first phone call , to being available for market . “ We have built up a lot of technology to make it easier for companies to build it into the product . ” Rausch makes a good point , but the mass adoption of Alexa has spurred many to question the security implications of this and whether the voice technology works perfectly for every device - particularly those where Alexa isn ’ t baked in . ( Last year 's Amazon speaker hack being a great example . ) This speed of release and breadth of products is something Amazon ’ s biggest rival in the voice space , Google , is also pushing at the moment . It chose IFA to announces that Google Assistant was now bilingual , understanding two languages at once without having to flip between these languages in the settings . `` The so-called smart home was a segment that was taking off for decades . '' While this particular feature isn ’ t available yet through Alexa , Rausch was keen to explain just how much work Amazon is doing in this space . “ Alexa has been ‘ multilingual ’ for some time , ” notes Rausch . “ Customers can pick a language - we have all different dialects of English , German , French ... we have announced Spanish is coming and Italian . Stay tuned for more - we aren ’ t here to speculate on future features but we love seeing the product in all these places . ” Having Alexa in all these places does bring us to the question of : where does Amazon and - more pertinently Alexa - go next ? “ The sky ’ s the limit - your vacuum cleaner , door , security system , your lawn . Everything you can imagine inside the home . You will also see that Alexa will just be embedded in more devices and customers will stop thinking about talking to a device per se . It will become more about speaking at large . ” It ’ s already out and about , beyond the home , too . There ’ s Alexa in the car ( Ford , Toyota , SEAT have all made announcements about this ) , there ’ s Alexa for hospitality where in certain hotels guests can get room service and towels through Alexa . Alexa for business is looking to do away with voice calling systems of old - more than 700 of these are used in Amazon ’ s own conference rooms already . “ We knew right away , from the response , that customers would want to connect with Alexa anywhere , ” says Rausch . “ We knew early on that we would want any developer to use Alexa and wanted Alexa to be able to do anything . So we built the skills kits and APIs so devs could extend capabilities . “ We soon won ’ t be just talking about the smart home but a world of smarts . ”

Not one to be left out , online retail megalith Amazon is now worth $ 1 trillion total market value , crossing the threshold during early afternoon on September 4 . Amazon has achieved the milestone just weeks following Apple ’ s $ 1 trillion valuation . We ’ d say that this valuation has been a long time coming , but Amazon was worth just $ 580 billion in comparison as of early 2018 , according to CNN . Why the massive surge in valuation , then ? Read more : Amazon Echo Input Up until this year Amazon was funneling much of its revenues into research and development for products and services as well as acquisitions , noted CNN . But , for around the past year , the company has simply been focused on tuning up profits through its cloud business known as Amazon Web Services , as well as the advertising and revenues from Prime membership subscriptions . However , that doesn ’ t entirely explain why investors are so absolutely bullish on Amazon . As CNN opines , and we largely agree , it ’ s been Amazon ’ s consistent ability to carve out a place for itself in every industry it has attempted to invest in . This has lately been achieved via acquisition , particularly in the cases of Whole Foods supermarkets in 2017 and smart security company Ring earlier this year . However , even more important to note is Amazon ’ s role as a data company . Amazon has petabytes worth of data on its customers regardless of whether they ’ re subscribers to Amazon Prime ( though , that helps immensely ) . If you ’ ve purchased something on Amazon or own one of its many Echo speakers or Fire tablets , then you ’ ve provided Amazon with data it has used in some capacity to improve its products and services – or better tailor its advertising – and therefore increase potential revenues and profits . Let ’ s hope Amazon now takes this valuation and turns it into an even better product in the next few years .
A new EU law will see minimum quotas for the amount of European content streamed through the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video . The online streaming services are said to have reached a preliminary agreement with European lawmakers , which would require 30 % of the content streamed in EU member states to be locally-made shows or movies . Individual nations could then opt to increase this figure to 40 % internally . The law seems like a certainty at this point . Talking to Variety , Roberto Viola , who heads the European Commission department for content , communications , and technology , called the upcoming vote “ a mere formality ” . Posting on his personal Twitter , Viola added that `` European film makers produce great content . It should be easier for them to bring it to new audiences . '' Both Netflix and Amazon see the business sense of expanding their libraries , so we expect to see more European content being brought in , rather than just cutting out non-EU content to balance the ratio . If that means more Nordic crime dramas or French arthouse cinema , who are we to complain ? The European Commission has previously been proactive about the rights of subscribers to paid streaming services – such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , or Spotify – which usually restrict content depending on the country being streamed to . As of April 1 , however , EU citizens travelling through Europe have been able to access the same package of titles as they would at home . A looming Brexit may mean UK subscribers don ’ t have these perks for long , but for now freedom of movement means freedom to stream what ’ s rightfully yours .

This means Shield TV can handle requests via Alexa as well as Google Assistant , which Nvidia says is a unique feature of its popular streaming device . Read more : HP Omen X Emperium To use Alexa to navigate through TV shows , films , and music , you need to pair your Shield TV with your Amazon Echo via the Alexa app .

Microsoft was able to once again regain its spot as the second most valuable company in the US after a disappointing quarterly report from Amazon lowered its market capitalization by $ 65bn . Apple still holds the top spot at over $ 1tn after it crossed the trillion dollar threshold back in September but Microsoft and Amazon are still competing for second place . Before the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s , Microsoft had the highest market capitalization on Wall Street . Amazon 's holiday season sales outlook missed targets which led its stock to drop by seven per cent which is the most its fallen in nearly three years . The plunge also raised concerns that Wall Street 's tech darlings have begun to face stiffer competition . Microsoft 's stock fell by just 1.1 per cent as a result of a broad technology sell-off led by Amazon 's holiday outlook and a weaker-than-expected report from Google 's parent company Alphabet . The company 's shares remain up by almost four per cent as the it beat quarterly profit expectations thanks in part to its cloud computing business which has improved at competing with Amazon 's AWS . Microsoft 's stock market value is around $ 823bn and it is on track to close above Amazon for the first time since April when it first gave up its spot as the second largest company in the US by market capitalization . Amazon meanwhile is worth $ 805bn after it fell below Microsoft in extended trading . After its recent decline , Amazon is up around 40 per cent year to date while Microsoft has gained around 25 per cent during 2018 . Apple will report its quarterly results on November 1st and then we 'll see just how the top second and third US tech company stack up to the trillion dollar giant . Via Reuters

When it launched , Amazon Fire TV Cube promised hands-free navigation from start to finish , a first for any streaming device . And while that certainly turned out to be the case if you stayed within the confines of Amazon ’ s own content library , navigating around third-party apps like Netflix and Hulu still required the remote . But , starting today , that all changes . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 A new update , which is currently rolling out to Amazon Fire TV Cube devices , will allow you to use voice commands like “ Alexa , scroll up ” or “ Alexa , move right ” in lieu of the remote to move around the aforementioned third-party apps . Even better , when you find something you want to watch , you can use the command “ Alexa , select this ” to start any content that ’ s highlighted on the screen . These commands will be supported on 17 of the Amazon Fire TV platform 's most popular apps starting today including ABC , Boomerang , Cartoon Network , The CW , CW Seed , DramaFever , ESPN , FilmStruck , FOX Now , FXNow , Hallmark Movies Now , HBO Go , HBO Now , Hulu , Netflix , Red Bull TV and Tubi TV , with more to be potentially added later . While this sounds like something that should ’ ve been functional right out of the box , due to the complexity of Alexa ’ s command structure it simply wasn ’ t possible - and , according to AFTVNews , still is n't possible across the board because of the way some apps are laid out . That said , thanks to some clever coding , Amazon has taken another step toward a completely remote-free experience and fixed one of the Amazon Fire TV Cube 's big drawbacks . That 's 17 apps down , only a couple thousand more to go .

Sssshhhh ... if the kids ( or parents ) are asleep and you do n't want to wake them up with a blast of Amazon Alexa 's voice , you can now activate a special Whisper Mode to have your Echo speak more quietly to you – at least if you 're using US English . TechCrunch reports that the feature , announced last month , is now making its way to Amazon Echo devices in the US , though it is n't enabled by default . You need to go into the Settings part of the Alexa app on your phone and then choose Alexa Account , Alexa Voice Responses , and Whispered Responses to turn it on . Read more : I-box Century review The feature can also be activated using your voice : just say `` Alexa , turn on whisper mode '' and future responses from your smart speaker will be read out in hushed tones until you turn Whisper Mode back off again ( via one of the same methods ) . As yet there 's no indication as to when the rest of the world will get the functionality , but it should n't be too long . Whisper Mode was unveiled in September alongside a big hardware refresh – featuring everything from a new Echo Dot to an Alexa microwave . Of course one of the appealing aspects of the Amazon Echo – and other smart speakers like it – is that new features can continually be added over the web without the need to buy any new gadgets . Amazon is also prepping an Alexa Guard option that can detect the sounds of a break-in in your home . If you 're in the US , you can see if Whisper Mode has arrived for you by updating the Alexa app on your iOS or Android device , and checking if the option appears in the app settings . If we hear more about worldwide availability , we 'll let you know .

There are Wi-Fi only versions of both the 8GB and 32GB , but you 'll have to buy the larger version if you want mobile connectivity as well . You 'll be able to buy the new Kindle Paperwhite from November 7 , but pre-orders have already opened on Amazon for the ereader .

It 's also got standard manual controls for when you want to go more old school . Available in the UK only from the Wondrwall website for £399 Although this intelligent home system has Alexa built-in , voice recognition is only one of 13 different sensors onboard , including motion , luminosity , humidity , power and sound .

Up until today , if you wanted to buy a smart display device , chances are you may have gone for the Amazon Echo Show , the Alexa-enabled screen that first appeared in 2017 , with a second-generation model currently available for pre-order . However , with Google announcing its debut first-party smart display at its Pixel 3 event on October 9 , the smart speaker could have a new rival to contend with - but which one should you buy ? We know how difficult it can be to choose the perfect smart speaker for your home , so we 've put together this handy comparison guide to help you decide whether you should purchase the brand new Google Home Hub , or the Amazon Echo Show . The Google Home Hub carries a 7-inch screen , an equal size to the first-generation Amazon Echo Show , but around three inches smaller than the Echo Show 's new model . Google 's screen is also supported by a much smaller speaker underneath - around the same size as the Google Home Mini - giving the impression of an almost floating display . Spooky . Like the Google Home Mini , the speaker base comes with a fabric covering and rounded corners , with a number of color options to best fit with your decor ( baby blue , pink , black , and white ) . It 's subtly different to the Amazon Echo Show , which encases its screen in a bulkier box-like structure , and only comes in monochromatic black or white . Amazon win out on size factor , but the smart display is for your home , and knowing what fits best with your other furnishings or color schemes may well be a deciding factor . First things first , the Google Home Hub does n't have a camera . That 's in stark contrast to the Echo Show , which allows you to take pictures or host video calls with other Echo devices , or even the newly announced Facebook Portal that seems almost entirely focused on video calling . But that 's not to say the Google Home Hub is light on features . For one , it comes with a 'voice match ' function that can recognize who is giving it orders and tailor the response to your individual user profile . That means you can start your day with tailored information on the day 's weather , your commute , upcoming calendar meetings and anything else you 've set up the Hub to remind you about . Other features include automatically switching off at night-time , and a dedicated 'Downtime Mode ' to prevent it distracting users - so , for homework or freelancers , basically . Not to forget , this is a smart home device we 're talking about . Google Home Hub unifies all the other smart home devices in your home - locks , cameras , thermostats , lights , etc - under 'Home View ' , letting you control them all separately from a drop-down dashboard . It 's a handy interface , though Amazon 's far more widespread smart assistant Alexa - compared to Google Assistant - tends to be the de facto AI connecting between smart home devices , so the former may be a better bet for house-wide smart integration . If we know anything about smart speakers , displays , and the like , it 's that a lot of these features are likely to change or be updated in software patches down the line . So keep an eye out on this page for new fixes and updates that could swing the balance in favor of one or the other . We could n't do a fair comparison without looking at the specific apps and services available on each device . If you 're looking for a smart display for the kitchen , the Google Home Hub will chime in with step-by-step meal recipes direct from Tasty.co , with accompanying photos and videos to show you what might have been ( or just to salivate over ) . It will also display images from your Google Photos account for your screensaver ( so keep it clean , you ) , using a machine learning algorithm to only pick out the largest and sharpest images , or to collate all the photos that include a certain face or person . The Google Home Hub is also perfectly placed to make use of Youtube - you know , the biggest video sharing site on the internet - that is also owned by Google 's parent company Alphabet . There 's an integrated Youtube app optimized for the display , and seems geared directly towards How To videos , as well as songs and playlists for ... practically all music . Google Home Hub buyers will even get 6 months Youtube Premium for free . Amazon 's Echo Show is n't allowed anywhere near Youtube , which is unsurprising given the advantage it gives to the Google Home Hub . But Amazon does have a near-monopoly of retail and streaming services that will only work in tandem with an Alexa-enabled smart speaker . So if you want voice-activated shopping on Amazon Prime , or access to Amazon Music / Music Unlimited , it would make more sense to pick the Echo Show . The Amazon Echo Show currently retails at $ 230 / £220 / AU $ 350 , with the incoming second-generation model matching it to the dollar . The Google Home Hub is comparatively easier on the wallet at only $ 149 / £139 ( around AU $ 210 ) , and is more in the price range of the screen-less Amazon Echo . Both products ' releases might be too close to think of any really sudden price drops this Black Friday or Cyber Monday , but if there is that may be a enough to sway you either way . It 's early days for Google 's contender , but it looks it offers a more complete package for users wanting smart integration with Google services , or or just a display focused on watching videos instead of calling your friends and family . However , the camera is a sore loss , and will equally be key piece of functionality for a lot of buyers . And while the Google Home Hub has a clear advantage with the particular Google-owned services like Youtube and Google Photos integrated into it , naturally this works the other way . Amazon 's Echo devices are the only ones linked up to your Amazon Prime or Amazon Music account - if you have them - and still make a persuasive case for sticking with the same family of products and services to get the most of their compatibility . Amazon 's smart assistant , Alexa , is also a lot more ubiquitous across other smart home devices , and is more likely to be compatible with any other smart purchases you 've already made . So are you game for the Echo Show 's camera features and Amazon services , or tempted by the Google Home Hub 's video-first mentality ? You can check our in-depth run-downs of both devices at the links below .

A new report shows that video piracy could be on the rise again after years of decline , and Netflix and Amazon ’ s fight to attract customers could be to blame . The report , published by networking company Sandvine , shows a marked rise in BitTorrent traffic , which is a good ( though imprecise ) indicator of pirate activity . This follows years of decline in piracy , partly due to more aggressive anti-piracy methods by content creators and ISP ( internet service providers ) , and also by the convenience of legal streaming . As BGR notes , when Netflix launched in a new country , a decrease in torrenting and piracy was recorded . However , it looks like that could now change . So , what could be to blame for this apparent rise in piracy ? According to Cam Cullen , VP of global marketing for Sandvine , the fight between Netflix and Amazon Prime ( and other streaming services ) for viewers could be the reason . As Cullen explains , “ more sources than ever are producing `` exclusive '' content available on a single streaming or broadcast service – think Game of Thrones for HBO , House of Cards for Netflix [ … ] To get access to all of these services , it gets very expensive for a consumer , so they subscribe to one or two and pirate the rest . ” This certainly makes sense , and if you want to watch Game of Thrones ( HBO ) , Stranger Things ( Netflix ) and American Gods ( Amazon Prime Video ) , then you ’ ll need three separate subscriptions . That can prove very pricey indeed . Cullen also points out that a lot of these exclusive shows are not available worldwide , so people in countries where they can not access the shows legally are now pirating them . If a show gains huge popularity and rave reviews , but the service it ’ s on doesn ’ t act fast and makes it available legally worldwide , then it can be a victim of its own success .

Apple and Amazon have denied claims their company networks have been compromised by a Chinese hacking operation , following a report by Bloomberg Businessweek which claimed China had infiltrated the servers of those and other US companies . The report cited 17 anonymous intelligence and company sources claiming that Chinese operatives had tampered with a “ technology supply chain ” , managing to place computer chips inside equipment that was shipped to 30 companies – which would potentially give China easy access to secure company networks . However , Apple and Amazon have vehemently denied the claims . Read more : Amazon Echo Link Amp Amazon Web Services said : “ At no time , past or present , have we ever found any issues relating to modified hardware or malicious chips in Super Micro motherboards in any Elemental or Amazon systems . ” Apple ’ s press release was equally strong . “ On this we can be very clear : Apple has never found malicious chips , ‘ hardware manipulations ’ or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server , ” it read . “ Apple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident . We are not aware of any investigation by the FBI , nor are our contacts in law enforcement . ” A letter sent to both the US Senate and US House by Apple ’ s Vice President for Information Security George Stathakopoulos – and obtained by Reuters – reaffirms the denial . “ Apple ’ s proprietary security tools are continuously scanning for precisely this kind of outbound traffic , as it indicates the existence of malware or other malicious activity . Nothing was ever found , ” he wrote . When the story broke last week , though , the US intelligence agencies were quiet , but the Department of Homeland Security stepped in over the weekend to say that although the agency is aware of Bloomberg ’ s report , it has “ no reason to doubt ” the statements made by the two companies . Bloomberg , however , is sticking to its story , leaving many confused as to who to believe .

Early on the morning of October 4 , Bloomberg 's Businessweek published a report detailing a concerted effort by Chinese government spies to install data-gathering hardware on server computers sold by China 's SuperMicro to Amazon and Apple , among other US companies . Both Amazon and Apple are now publicly denying these claims . `` As we have previously informed Bloomberg , this is completely untrue , '' part of Apple 's public statement reads . `` Apple has never found malicious chips in our servers . '' Apple 's response attempts to address nearly every point of Bloomberg 's report citing anonymous sources , directly refuting all of its claims . And , so does Amazon 's response . Each response appears to be chiefly concerned about the claim in Bloomberg 's report that both companies learned of these Chinese intrusions and reported them to US federal authorities while keeping the issues secret from the public . While it 's impossible to know who is wrong in this scenario , we do know the implications of such a claim much less such a reality . The Super Micro servers in question in this report have powered some of the most ubiquitous apps and services around the world , like Amazon Web Services cloud hosting and the search function of Apple 's Siri digital assistant . If true , this means that the Chinese government may well have been harvesting data from two of the world 's largest corporations and service providers since 2014 – all with a microchip 'the size of a grain of rice , ' as Businessweek puts it . So , you can clearly see why Apple and Amazon have so directly gotten in front of this report , something either company very rarely does , with statements nearly as long and detailed as the report itself . Regardless of what you think after reading Businessweek 's report and these statements , what 's crystal clear is that this storm is far from over .

Sandwiched between the Roku Premiere and upcoming third-generation Chromecast that ’ s reported to be revealed at Google ’ s upcoming Pixel 3 event on October 9 , Amazon today has unveiled a new entry in the affordable , small and powerful category : the new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K . Not only will Amazon 's thumb drive-sized streaming device be capable of 4K HDR playback , but the updated streaming stick will have a number of new specs – like an 802.11ac Wi-Fi chip and a 1.7GHz quad-core processor – that will help it compete with ( and potentially beat out ) the two new small form factor streaming devices from Roku and Google . Of course , new hardware is n't the only trick up the Fire TV Stick 's sleeve . Despite sitting underneath Amazon ’ s refreshed Amazon Fire TV dongle , the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K will offer just as much functionality as its larger predecessor with the added capability of streaming 4K HDR content in HDR10 , Dolby Vision and HDR10+ formats – a first for any streaming device . On top of offering three types of HDR support , the Amazon Fire TV 4K will support Dolby Atmos object-based surround sound for Amazon ’ s growing library of Atmos-enabled content – another feature that ’ s found on only a handful of streaming devices at the moment – and should be about 80 % more powerful than the current-generation Amazon Fire TV Stick in-stores now . Add to all of that Alexa integration either via Amazon ’ s new-and-improved Amazon Alexa Voice Remote or Echo device – and an unbelievable low sticker price of $ 49 ( £49 , around AU $ 68 ) – and you have a potentially strong contender for king of the streaming stick wars when Fire TV Stick 4K becomes available on October 31 in the US and Canada and November 14 in the UK , Germany and India . One of the larger complaints we had about the Amazon Fire TV is that the remote did n't let you control the volume like some other streaming devices – something that Amazon has set out to fix with the new Amazon Alexa Voice Remote . The remote , which can be purchased separately for $ 29.99 ( around £20 , AU $ 40 ) , adds dedicated power , volume , and mute buttons to the traditional Amazon Fire TV remote design and allows you to control most AV devices connected to your TV . While Amazon did n't come out and say it directly , all this capability likely comes down to the player adopting CEC ( Consumer Electronics Control ) via HDMI ARC . The remote itself combines Bluetooth and multidirectional infrared technology ( a technology employed by the Amazon Fire TV Cube ) and could be the all-in-one solution Amazon desperately needs for its players . The Alexa Voice Remote will be available the same day as the new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K ( October 31 for United States and Canada , November 14 in the UK , Germany , and India ) and will be available bundled with the Amazon Fire TV Cube in the US starting on October 31 .

The Amazon-owned entertainment site IMDB may be announcing a free TV channel for Amazon 's range of Fire TV media players , as early as this week . Sources close to the project spoke to CNBC , saying that the dedicated Fire TV channel would echo similar offerings from Hulu or The Roku Channel . This means paid-for advertisements would be funding the freely-available content , which is expected to include a range of TV series and films for viewers . Read more : Amazon Echo Input Advertisements are already found on a number of Fire TV apps , though the dedicated channel is expected to double down with ads between television content – and placed around the video window . Amazon Prime naturally has a large library of video content already , though we 'd imagine the provider would n't want to overly cannibalize its own services for the free channel – which will be available for all Fire TV owners , rather than just Amazon Prime members . TV advertising is still a lucrative business , and Amazon has the customer data from its various retail and streaming service arms – Amazon Prime , Amazon Music , Audible , and the like – to offer a targeted range of advertisements to the Fire TV 's user base . The free channel is just the latest in Amazon 's various moves into home entertainment , off the back of a new Fire TV Cube that combines the best of Amazon 's media players with a fleshed-out Alexa smart assistant . A TV channel may seem innocuous enough , but it 's clear Amazon is looking to make Fire TV an increasingly harder service to resist .

Just when we thought there weren ’ t any more Coffee Lake Refresh details to leak , Amazon reportedly goes and leaks the price and packaging for Intel ’ s upcoming flagship processor . Thanks to an accidentally posted Amazon listing for the Intel Core i9-9900K spotted by Momomo_Us , we now know the processor won ’ t come in any ordinary box , but a transparent dodecahedron . If this 12-sided die-shaped packaging is the real deal , it would seem Intel aims to one-up AMD ’ s packaging game , which has introduced some outstanding boxes for Ryzen Threadripper 1st and 2nd Generation CPUs . We 're not terribly convinced by the screenshot , simply because it looks like a blown-up dodecahedron die with a bit of Intel Core i9 badging pasted onto it . A 12-sided shape also seems like a curious choice when the Intel Core i9-9900K is rumored to feature 8-cores and 16-threads . As Wccftech notes , a hexadecagon or octahedron would have better reflected the product . ☕️®️🎁https : //t.co/HkemyWeWsj⁉️October 1 , 2018 Casing aside , the Amazon listing also suggests the Intel Core i9-9900K will cost $ 582 ( about £450 , AU $ 810 ) . That ’ s quite a bit higher than the $ 480 ( about £370 , AU $ 660 ) price for the same chip we saw leaked by Silicon Lottery , which came alongside a rumored $ 370 ( about £280 , AU $ 510 ) price for the Intel Core i7-9700K . Comparatively , the most expensive Intel Coffee Lake processors are the $ 359 ( £389 , AU $ 524 ) Intel Core i7-8700K and $ 425 ( £419 , AU $ 629 ) Intel Core i7-8086K . Via Tom ’ s Hardware

After years of feuding , it looks as though Apple and Amazon are ready to make up and play nice . The first sign of a budding friendship ? Apple is bringing its widely used Apple Music streaming service to Amazon Echo devices starting on December 17 . It ’ s certainly a strange move for the two companies who have , at several points in the last few years , removed streaming services from one another ’ s platforms and refused to sell each other ’ s hardware in their respective stores – and that ’ s not even mentioning the fact that Apple has its own smart speaker , the Apple HomePod , that could use a little more attention – but it could be the start of something good . Whatever Apple ’ s motivation is , starting mid-December , you ’ ll be able to use the full breadth of Apple Music on Amazon Echo devices , according to a post on Amazon 's Day One blog . That includes Beats Radio stations , Apple-curated playlists and access to the service ’ s massive song catalog . To use Apple Music on your Amazon Echo Show , Amazon Echo Dot or any other Amazon Echo device , you ’ ll need to enable the Apple Music skill from the Alexa Skill Store . Once enabled , you can use commands like `` Alexa , play Bebe Rexha on Apple Music '' . Specifying Apple Music is important , remember , because the Echo also supports other big name streaming services like Pandora , Spotify , iHeartRadio and TuneIn . Do n't expect Apple to stop gloating over how it made the best smart speaker now that Apple Music lives on Amazon Echo devices , but it might be the first signs of a thawing friendship between two of tech 's biggest powerhouses .

During its re : Invent conference in Las Vegas today , Amazon announced its own fully managed ledger database with a central trusted authority called Amazon Quantum Ledger Database ( QLDB ) . The service provides customers with an append-only , fixed journal that tracks the history of all changes made to it . Amazon also touted QLDB 's other features such as its transparent nature , ease of use and speed . Compared with existing products , the e-commerce giant 's offering can execute two to three times more transactions . AWS CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the new service 's strengths , saying : “ It will be really scalable , you ’ ll have a much more flexible and robust set of APIs for you to make any kind of changes or adjustments to the ledger database . ” In addition to its new managed ledger database , Amazon also revealed that it had created its own managed blockchain service called AWS Managed Blockchain which also works with QLDB . The company offered further details on its managed blockchain offering in an announcement , saying : “ Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service that allows you to set up and manage a scalable blockchain network with just a few clicks . Amazon Managed Blockchain eliminates the overhead required to create the network , and automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions . Once your network is up and running , Managed Blockchain makes it easy to manage and maintain your blockchain network . It manages your certificates , lets you easily invite new members to join the network , and tracks operational metrics such as usage of compute , memory , and storage resources . ” Customers interested in trying out Amazon Managed Blockchain for themselves can sign up for a preview on the company 's site .

BBC R & D has launched a new interactive radio drama for Amazon Alexa that 's different for everyone who hears it . The Unfortunates is adapted from a BBC Radio 3 play starring Martin Freeman , which was based on an experimental 'book in a box ' novel by BS Johnson . The story contained 27 unbound sections , with only the start and end points specified ; the rest could be read in any order . Read more : I-box Century review The story , which was originally released in 1969 , follows a sports journalist whose memories of a friend are triggered when he is sent to report on a football match , and according to the author , the format is intended to convey `` the mind 's randomness '' . The new radio drama is split into 17 sections , which are shuffled with each listen . As with Johnson 's book , only the first and last chapters are fixed in place . Last year , BBC R & D released its first interactive audio drama for smart speakers : sci-fi story The Inspection Chamber . The production cast the listener in an active role , speaking with other characters as the story progressed . `` [ We ] found a perfect example of a story we could bring to smart speakers , creating something which would sound and interact like a traditional radio programme but also take advantage of new technology '' Afterwards , senior producer and creative technologist Henry Cooke carried out a detailed survey to find out how listeners felt about such productions , and discovered that people fell into two distinct groups . One set of listeners wanted more interaction , creating an experience more like a game , while the other preferred not to interact with a story once it was in motion . However , even among the latter group , people were interested in a story that could change in interesting ways ; they just did n't want to be interacting with it constantly . While considering that split , Cooke had a conversation with his colleague Tom Armitage , who mentioned Radio 3 's adaptation of Johnson 's book . `` We dug into it a little more , and found a perfect example of a story we could bring to smart speakers , creating something which would sound and interact like a traditional radio programme but also take advantage of new technology , '' says Cooke . The order for the radio adaptation was picked live on a special edition of radio programme The Verb , but after that it was frozen , losing the randomness of the printed version . `` Near the beginning of this year , I collaborated on a quick prototype with BBC R & D alumnus Tom Howe , chopping up the Radio 3 broadcast back up into its parts and building a player for Alexa which shuffled those parts into a new order – essentially , a randomized playlist , '' says Cooke . `` We then took that version to a meeting with the Radio 3 creative team – producer Mary Peate and writer Graham White – who had no idea what we ’ d been up to ! `` Luckily , they loved what we ’ d done to their show , and were very supportive of our new version . This meant that the hard work of building out our prototype into a full skill could begin . '' Cooke has described the full process of adapting the drama for smart speakers on the BBC R & D blog , including how the team overcame challenges like managing she sheer number of audio assets , controlling the flow of conversation , and creating artwork for Amazon Echo devices with screens ( like the Echo Show ) . The interactive version of The Unfortunates is free to download . To listen , ask your Alexa device to enable The Unfortunates , find it in the Alexa Skill Store , or get it from the BBC Taster website .

In the latest development in its move into the healthcare industry , Amazon Web Services has begun to sell software to mine patient medical records for information that could aid doctors and hospitals in improving treatment and cutting costs . The company 's software is able to read digitized patient records , analyse them and compile the most useful information into a spreadsheet-like report . AWS has also been selling text-analysis software to companies in the travel , customer support and supply-chain management industries though this is the first time Amazon has offered it to the healthcare industry . Additionally the company is also looking to expand its sales of medical supplies through an app which will use electronic medical records to allow doctors to send links to products needed for their treatment to patients . Amazon 's software developers used deep learning to train their system to recognise doctors ' notes which have notoriously been difficult for even other people to read . General Manager of AI at AWS Matt Wood explained how accurate the company 's software was to the Wall Street Journal , saying : “ We ’ re able to completely , automatically look inside medical language and identify patient details , ” including diagnoses , treatments , dosage and strengths , “ with incredibly high accuracy . ” The software will first be used to assist the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center which aided Amazon in testing and training its algorithm to identify patients that are eligible for studies of experimental drugs . The data processed by AWS will be encrypted so that only customers with the key will be able to access it . Via WSJ

Amazon has admitted it has been hit by a data breach affecting shoppers just hours before Black Friday . Customers have reported being contacted by Amazon Customer Service , which said that names and addresses were `` inadvertently disclosed '' due to a `` technical error '' . Read more : Amazon Echo Link Amp It 's not known exactly how many customers have been affected by the breach , although users from multiple countries including the US and UK took to social media to report receiving the email . Amazon said that the issue has now been fixed , adding that , `` this is not a result of anything you have done , and there is no need for you to change your password or take any other action . '' The company 's UK press office has confirmed that the email was genuine , saying in a comment sent to media that , `` We have fixed the issue and informed customers who may have been impacted . '' However it would not provide any further details , but the news comes a month after a similar email was sent out after an employee was caught selling customer data . Depending on the details of the breach , Amazon could be in breach of the EU GDPR legislation , meaning it may face a major fine .

If you have an Amazon Echo speaker you can now stream music directly from Tidal , giving you more listening options than ever before . The streaming service , which is owned by Jay-Z , is designed to provide listeners with hi-fidelity audio , promising a level of sound quality equivalent to CDs . Read more : NAD Masters Series M10 stereo system It 's now the first streaming platform to take advantage of Amazon 's Music Skills API , an initiative that makes it possible for services to add in support for Alexa themselves – in the past , companies like Spotify and Deezer had to rely on Amazon to enable Alexa support . To use Tidal on your Echo , Echo Dot , or Echo Plus you 'll need to enable the dedicated Alexa skill – you will of course need a Tidal subscription as well . If you were hoping to play hi-fidelity audio through your Amazon Echo , you 'll be disappointed , as hardware limitations mean that the Echo ca n't support Tidal 's high quality FLAC 'Masters ' tracks . Still , you 'll be able to stream the platform 's curated playlists in lower-resolution AAC files , which is what you 'll be used to if you 're a Tidal Premium subscriber – only Tidal Hi-Fi subscribers have access to those super hi-fi FLAC files .

Amazon Echo speakers , powered by the Alexa voice assistant , are a glimpse into a hands-free future , one in which our every command is handled by some disembodied helper and its legion of robotic household minions . Watch as evolution turns our hands into wasted hunks of meat and muscle , devolving over the coming millenia into little more than smart-ring wearing trotters . That future , however , isn ’ t quite with us yet - there 's still a place for touch to help you control your smart home . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 That 's where the redesigned Echo Buttons come in - and they 're now much more worthy of parting with cash for . Though originally the Buttons were designed to be controllers for audio-and-voice party games , a new update has greatly expanded what the devices are capable of , which is the main reason we now feel confident to recommend them . Using the Alexa app , the Echo Buttons can now be programmed to control multiple smart home devices at once , letting you build up routines to instantly set a scene with just a tap . Want your lights to switch off , your doors to lock and your thermostat to heat up all in one go ? A programmed Amazon Echo Button can now let you do that , or any other combination of Alexa-compatible features . You ’ re only limited by your connected gear and your ingenious imagination . Echo Buttons connect to your Amazon Echo devices and give you a different , easy and fun way to play games and control skills . They unsurprisingly look like big buttons and measure 75mm across , making them big enough to press in a hurry but compact enough to sit on your coffee table . You can connect up to four buttons to each of your Amazon Echo gadgets via Bluetooth and the whole Echo range is compatible , whether you 've got a Plus and the Spot or the Show and the Dot . Powered by a pair of triple-A batteries , they glow different colors depending on the role they ’ re currently taking on . Amazon currently offers up more than 75 different Alexa gaming skills that you can use the buttons for , like Trivial Pursuit , Guess The Logo and Would You Rather . It 's not just about fun and games though , as Echo Buttons can be practical and trigger commands such as playing music , turning off lights or telling the family dinner is ready . You can easily customise the uses of your buttons from within the Alexa app . Yes – there are plenty of smart switches out there , but the majority of them are purely for triggering smart lighting - the Philips Hue Tap for instance . The Amazon Echo Button stands apart by being able to run entire smart home routines from a single button press – and doing so without breaking the bank . If there ’ s a drawback of the Buttons though , it ’ s the fact that they ’ re solely battery powered , If you become reliant on their programmed routines and find that they ’ ve run out of battery overnight , you ’ re going to have to get chatty with your home all over again . With little on the market to offer a similar function at such a low price , we ’ d say the time is now right to buy an Amazon Echo Button . In fact , the timing of the update seems very fortuitous . With Black Friday just around the corner , and the Amazon Echo line-up being at the heart of Amazon ’ s deal offering every year , we ’ d expect to see the Echo Buttons making an appearance of some sort . Working solely within Amazon ’ s Alexa ecosystem , and at loss leading prices , we ’ d imagine these will get a slight discount , or will become bundled in with the smart home accessories that they ’ ll be able to control . In that respect you may want to hold out to see what deal season brings . But as an affordable additional option for controlling your smart home , they ’ re well worth a try , and a great way of getting those not comfortable with a connected home familiar with their interactive capabilities .
It 's great being able to talk to an Amazon Echo speaker – that sci-fi sheen never wears off as you get your Alexa-powered , voice activated assistant to do your bidding with just a few words . But what if you ca n't remember the right words ? Or , heaven forbid , you have a sore throat ? Sometimes you need to rest those vocal chords , especially if you 've got a complicated command that needs specific phrasing for Alexa to understand . If you 've invested in Amazon 's Echo Buttons , you 've now got an alternative control method . Though the colorful buzzers were originally designed for Alexa-powered gaming , they 've now been updated to be able to control smart home routines . So , what separates these from , say , just a regular light switch then ? Not only can they be placed anywhere around a room that you like , but they can also be programmed within the Alexa app to control more than one gadget at once . Want your Hue bulbs to come on at the same time as your smart coffee brewer ? Or all the smart locks in your home to slam shut at the same time ? Program an Echo Button to do it and with a tap you 're sorted . It 's a nice way of breathing new life into the ( somewhat wasted ) Echo Buttons for those living in an Alexa world . And , if you 're living with family or visitors that just ca n't get their heads around the thought of conversing with a machine , they 've now got a tactile way to enjoy the benefits of a smart home too . At $ 19.99/£19.99 a pair , the new feature lands just in time to be partnered up with your Black Friday smart home purchases .

New research from TrendForce has revealed that global tablet shipments are expected to decline by 4.3 per cent year-over-year in 2018 to 145.5m units as sales of entry-level devices decline due to the rise of smart speakers and higher currency exchange rates . In response to the overall decline of tablet sales worldwide , brands typically tend to offer lower prices to retain customers while investing less in new tablet development . Huawei appears to be doing just the opposite and the Chinese hardware maker is developing both smartphones as well as new tablets . The company 's tablet shipments are expected to rise by more than 30 per cent to more than 14m units with a market share of 9.8 per cent . Huawei 's increased tablet sales will also enable the company to become the 3rd largest tablet manufacturer this year surpassing Amazon . Amazon 's focus has shifted from tablets to its Echo line of smart speakers and after three years of strong growth , the US e-commerce giant is expected to record a more conservative shipment of 13.4m units this year . Meanwhile , Apple has launched its new 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models ahead of the holidays . However , TrendForce predicts that sales of these devices will be hurt by the fact that they were released just after the company starting selling new iPhones with premium prices . “ With the launch of new devices in the coming era of 5G , the tablet category will still help the brands build a strategic future , retaining their customer bases and becoming more influential in the global IoT network , '' TrendForce notebook analyst Kou-Han Tseng said . `` Therefore , major brands will not give up their tablet product lines , even at the expense of downsizing their entry-level product ranges .

If you 've shopped online for a new iPhone or iPad and tried to check Amazon , you 've probably run into a bunch of third-party sellers . But , soon Amazon will have its own offerings of new Apple products , including the iPhone XS , iPhone XR , and new iPad Pro . `` Amazon is constantly working to enhance the customer experience , '' Amazon told TechRadar in a statement . `` And one of the ways we do this is by increasing selection of the products we know customers want . We look forward to expanding our assortment of Apple and Beats products globally . ” The new Amazon deal , first spotted by CNET , will limit the sellers of new and used Apple products on Amazon to Apple-authorized resellers . Meaning you 'll likely see fewer different product pages for the same Apple product . You 'll also see newer devices at retail price , and with any luck , you might catch some Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals with Amazon directly offering these products . The deal includes Apple and Beats devices , according to CNET ( though not all products , as the Apple HomePod wo n't be sold ) , and it affect both the US and UK , along with several other European countries , Japan , and India . It 's not clear exactly when Amazon will begin offer Apple 's new products directly , but it will be in the coming weeks . One date that is clear though is the January 4 , 2019 , cutoff for independent sellers . After that day , only Apple-authorized resellers will be able to keep listings for new and used Apple devices . If Amazon begins to sell the new Apple products before Black Friday and Cyber Monday , the new listings combined with existing reseller offers could largely expand the online availability of iPhones and iPads for holiday shoppers .

Amazon is launching its own fleet of thousands of delivery drivers in the US , in order to meet seasonal demand for its online retail arm . The newly-minted fleet of 'Delivery Associates ' will be responsible for last-mile deliveries to customers ' homes , and are seeing roles advertised for $ 16.25- $ 17.25 ( around £13 / AU $ 23 ) earnings per hour . Read more : Amazon Echo Link Amp Job postings suggested shifts could be up to 12 hours long , and would unsurprisingly require some degree of physical activity for lifting and carrying products over the finish line . The announcement comes just days after Amazon waived its $ 25 minimum spend for free delivery over the holiday season , meaning that even minuscule orders will get free passage across the US - so there 's likely to be a lot of demand for a dedicated fleet of drivers . It means purchases made over Black Friday , Cyber Monday and Christmas should arrive with you in a timely manner . Amazon 's own shipping costs have been ballooning in recent years as its global reach and user base has grown , and bringing last-mile deliveries in-house may be seen as one way to limit those costs or reduce dependency on third-party contractors . Traditionally Amazon has relied on the likes of FedEx and UPS to complete deliveries , though Amazon 's internal $ 15 minimum wage is a fair step above the Federal requirement of $ 7.85 , and is likely to prove attractive over its current delivery partners . Amazon wo n't be self-sufficient in this regard yet , and what we 're seeing is effectively a trial on home turf - there are currently no announcements about instigating similar fleets abroad - but it 's a clear sign the retail giant is looking towards a future where every stage of sale or distribution is under the Amazon umbrella .

Amazon is testing a new service that will let you pick which day your orders are delivered . Amazon Day ( not to be confused with Amazon Prime Day ) is currently available to a selected group of shoppers in the US , giving them the option to pick a specific day of the week to receive deliveries . The new service means you can schedule your deliveries to fit around your existing schedule . For example , if you always work from home on Wednesdays , make that your Amazon Day and all your orders will be delivered then . Your Amazon Day will remain the default for all future orders until you change it . Read more : Living DNA review Not only does that make shopping more convenient , helping avoid the potential for orders being pilfered from your porch ( those Amazon delivery drones have yet to go mainstream ) , it also has a couple of environmental benefits . Because all your goodies are delivered together , Amazon can pack them into fewer boxes and fewer road journeys are required to get them to your door . `` We 're excited to be testing a new service aimed at making the delivery experience more convenient for customers , '' said Amazon spokesperson Kristen Kish in a statement . We do n't yet know whether the company plans to roll out the option to customers globally , but it could be a real boon for shoppers around the world without the time to wait in for deliveries . Whether you 're part of the trial group or not , Amazon is one of the retailers we 're expecting to offer some great deals on tech this Black Friday and Cyber Monday . We 'll be listing all the best deals as soon as they appear in our ultimate Amazon Black Friday guide . Via CNET
Amazon has announced that it will be waiving its minimum spend for free delivery in the run up to Christmas , meaning you can make orders under $ 25 and not pay a penny extra for shipping . The offer is running from November 5 up to the last day of shipping before Christmas – this is the last day Amazon can guarantee items will arrive in time for the big day ( typically 5-8 business days in advance ) . Read more : Living DNA review Uncapped free delivery is available to all US customers , so you do n't even need an Amazon Prime membership to take advantage of this deal . Plus , with Black Friday coming up on November 23 , you 'll be able to get free shipping on even the cheapest items ( although you may find it difficult to spend less than $ 25 over Black Friday and Cyber Monday ) . The announcement of this offer is likely an attempt by Amazon to pile pressure on competitors like Walmart and Target ahead of the Christmas spending period , and may encourage customers to sign up for a Prime membership in January . There 's a lot to love about Amazon Prime – with access to a huge range of TV shows , music , and movies , as well as next day delivery on your Amazon orders , buying a membership is perhaps one of the smartest ways to spend your money . But if you only use the site for your Black Friday and Christmas shopping , the news that uncapped free delivery is coming to all US customers is sure to be very welcome indeed .

Google and Amazon are both going all out to dominate the smart home market - while Google recently brought out its new smart display , Google Home Hub , Amazon announced roughly 70 Alexa-enabled devices one month prior . And Apple ? Apple brought out its first smart speaker , the Apple HomePod in February this year , and has n't mentioned any new smart devices since then . Siri , Apple 's voice assistant , also has n't received any major updates . That looks like it 's causing the brand big problems in terms of its foothold in the smart home market , with CEO of market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners , Michael Levin , telling CNET that , `` Apple is n't in danger of falling behind . They have already fallen way behind . '' Its rivals stealing a march in the smart home arena could lead to some people might think that it 's not possible to use a Google- or Amazon-powered smart speaker with an iPhone , which could have a detrimental effect on iPad or iPhone sales . In reality an Android or iPhone device will be able to interact with a smart speaker equally as well , and in the case of Apple 's efforts if the speaker has Siri baked in too will be able to function as a multi-room option . If Apple were to allow Android devices to control its HomePod , for instance , it might get a much wider audience for it 's smart ecosystem - the fact it has n't done that might hint that being in the race with Google and Amazon is n't the main priority for the brand . Still , it may not be too late for Apple to catch up - the digital home industry is really in its infancy , and one big innovation from the tech giant could be all it takes to edge it into pole position . Knowing the resources Apple commands , that 's not outside the realms of possibility - but it needs to come up with the idea soon . Via CNET

Update : Amazon has confirmed to TechRadar that there was an issue with its service , but it has now been fixed . `` For a short period yesterday morning we had an issue that intermittently impacted some Alexa customers ’ ability to interact with the service . The Alexa service is now operating normally , '' a spokesperson told us . Original story continues below : The Amazon Alexa voice assistant is down in the UK , Germany , and other parts of Europe , according to reports from multiple users on Christmas morning . This is a problem , as millions of people unwrap Amazon Echo speakers for Christmas around the world , and Amazon 's Alexa AI is what powers these smart speakers . There are outage spikes for Christmas morning if you look at Down Detector , and the heat map for Alexa being down focuses on the UK and Germany . Some users are now reporting that Alexa is beginning to come online for them , while others are experiencing limited functionality . In other words , stick with it . The US does n't appear to be affected right now by the same Amazon Alexa outage , at least not yet . We tested it this morning to make sure . However , as more users unwrap , unbox , and set up Alexa-powered speakers , that always could change . We 'll keep monitoring the outage situation in the US . The Amazon Echo Dot was Amazon 's most popular gift in the lead up to the holidays . It 's clearly going to strain its massive servers this morning .
Sony ’ s PlayStation Classic is an amazing device , but we found it doesn ’ t quite measure up to Nintendo ’ s NES and SNES nostalgia boxes . Namely , the PS1 revival machine ’ s games catalog left out some of heavy-hitters . Update : Sony and Amazon have slashed the PlayStation Classic even further after Christmas to just $ 59.99 – a 40 % or $ 40 discount . Sony PlayStation Classic : $ 100 $ 60 on Amazon The PlayStation Classic is a retro gamer 's dream . Featuring a replicated ( and micro-sized ) PlayStation console , two controllers and 20 games , this is a great gift – at an amazing 40 % off price – for the old-school gamer in your life.View Deal The PS Classic console itself is nearly worth the price alone : it ’ s a faithfully-reproduced yet shrunken version of the original PlayStation with functioning buttons . The bundled-in pair of controllers are dead ringers for the ones that came with the first round of PS1 systems , though they don ’ t have control sticks ( thankfully , there are workarounds ) . Sadly , it doesn ’ t have a functioning CD reader or lid , so you won ’ t be able to play your old PS1 discs . You can ’ t add more games digitally , either . But , for a reduced price , the list of games isn ’ t bad , with classics like Final Fantasy VII , Tekken 3 , Oddworld : Abe 's Oddysee , Rayman , Resident Evil Director 's Cut and Metal Gear Solid headlining the console . The rest are a mix of cult classics and forgotten titles , so don ’ t expect old favorites like Crash Bandicoot , Tomb Raider , Chrono Cross or Gran Turismo . A discounted $ 60 makes this nostalgia box an amazing buy – and , since it ’ s shipped by Amazon , it will probably make it to you before Christmas break is over .

Viewers , assemble ! DC Universe , the all-in-one-place streaming service for DC television shows , films and comics , has now arrived on Amazon Fire TV streaming devices . DC 's platform launched mid-September , and was already available on Roku streaming devices , Android TV , Apple TV , and Android/iOS mobile devices . The addition to Amazon 's streaming devices will be sure to get it in more people 's homes , even if DC Universe is currently limited to the United States , and has yet to appear on Xbox One or PS4 consoles , or other smart TV platforms . Amazon Fire TV owners can now download the DC Universe app , though you 'll still need a $ 8/m ( around £6 , AU $ 11 ) subscription to DC Universe to access any of the content . There 's also an annual subscription option for $ 75 ( around £60 , AU $ 105 ) . DC Universe launched on September 15 , on what DC has taken to calling 'Batman Day ' , after one of the publishing company 's most iconic heroes . In keeping with the image of Batman 's tortured hero , however , the rest of us outside the US have been excluded from joining in the fun - even if the live-action Titans has now been confirmed for Netflix UK . The streaming service is still only a few months old , and its push to be seen on as many platforms as possible will hopefully lead to DC Universe entering other territories and markets other than its home soil in the near future .

We ’ re all familiar by now with Amazon and the ridiculously broad range of goods it offers , but the online retail giant is reportedly drawing a line with its cheaper products in order to increase profit margins even further . The Wall Street Journal has heard from “ major brand executives and people familiar with the company ’ s thinking ” that Amazon is waging war against its CRaP ( Can ’ t Realize a Profit ) products , as they are apparently referred to internally . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 These products are typically snack foods and beverages that weigh in under $ 15 . Due to their relatively high weight or size , they are costly to ship despite their low value , and don ’ t make Amazon enough of a profit as a result . An example provided by WSJ is the recently-removed six-pack of bottled water from Coca-Cola Co , which was cheap , heavy , and had to be shipped by Amazon . This combination actually resulted in losses rather than profits , and the product has since been replaced by a 24-pack with a higher per-bottle cost that ships from Coca-Cola direct . The trillion-dollar company has somewhat of a vice grip on major brands , WSJ notes , as they don ’ t have an option but to offer their products on the ubiquitous service , particularly in the US , given its mammoth stake in the e-commerce world . This means that Amazon will be able to get away with offloading these costs to other big brands , because it ultimately holds leverage over whether or not they get exposure to the majority of online shoppers .

Back in September , Amazon announced a huge number of new Echo products , without filling in too many details about when they would be available . It looks like the launch of one of these gadgets , the Amazon Echo Auto , has now been pushed back to 2019 . While Amazon has n't said anything officially , the product page for the Echo Auto has scrubbed any mention of `` this year '' from the listing , AFTVnews notes . Interested punters can still sign up to try and nab an exclusive invitation , but now there 's no promises as to when those invitations are actually going to go out . Another tweak to the Echo Auto description suggests only Google Maps is going to be supported at launch , with Apple Maps and Waze support following at some point later on – worth bearing in mind if you 're thinking of signing up . The Amazon Echo Auto is currently being promoted at a knock-down price of $ 24.99 , with a full retail price of $ 49.99 ( at the moment only US customers can sign up for an invite ) . It 's essentially like a little Echo Dot that sits on your dashboard . By hooking up to your smartphone for connectivity , the Echo Auto can do all the usual Alexa tricks , answering questions from the web , playing music and audiobooks , and telling you about your upcoming calendar schedule . It can also work with location-based reminders , so you get an alert to buy milk when you arrive at the grocery store . Other new Echo-enabled devices announced in September have now gone on sale , at least in the US : the Amazon Echo Wall Clock can now be yours for $ 29.99 , keeping time automatically and making it easier to see your Alexa timers .

Starting today , Amazon is trialling a new crowdsourcing program for its Alexa smart assistant - one that will look to users like you to fill in the gaps of its knowledge . ( No pressure . ) The Alexa Answers program has begun inviting select customers to take part in the beta , which allows you to browse through unanswered questions on various topics - science , technology , trivia , and the like - and offer your two cents . Read more : I-box Century review Those answers are then offered up to other users who can vote the suggestion up or down in order to rate its accuracy or helpfulness . There 's no claim to fame for upvoted answers , sadly , but Alexa will let you know if its used `` an Amazon customer '' as a source . There are naturally filters for keeping out profane language ; there will always be those determined to muck around , though we imagine Alexa will be able to prevent 'unhelpful ' users from submitting ever more answers . For a smart assistant whose main use is in offering information to those who need it , Alexa sure can get things wrong . Alexa uses a variety of sources for gathering information from across the web - via Bing searches , online dictionaries , or crowdsourced sites like Wikipedia - with the margins for error that entails . The key thing to remember is that the internet is littered with mistakes and misinformation , and that inevitably trickles down to the answers users find on Google , Wikipedia , social media , and naturally AI like Alexa or Siri . Amazon already relies on human-sourced reviews for rating and advertising its products , so the Alexa Answers program is in some ways just a natural extension of that philosophy . Whether adding another human element to the mix will make things better , or worse , will depend on how motivated users are to help . Via The Verge

Amazon is looking to expand its futuristic brick-and-mortar grocery store Amazon Go to airports in the US , according to public records requests sent to several airport operators . Emails between Amazon and a number of airports , including Los Angeles International , reveal that the tech giant had requested meetings to discuss Amazon Go with technology advisers and concessions officials . Aside from a few humans who hang around to keep the place stocked , Amazon Go stores are fully automated . To shop there , you need to download a special app , which registers you as you walk in . Cameras inside the shelves and throughout the store register which items you 've picked up and add them to your virtual cart . You 'll be charged once you leave the store , meaning that you do n't have to wait in long queues for the cashier when you 're grabbing a few last minute essentials for your flight . Although Amazon has declined to comment , a move into airports could be a huge boost for the fledgling Go chain , and could certainly offer weary travelers a convenient shopping experience . However , if Amazon Go is to make the leap , it would need to convince concession officials that its technology would work in an airport environment . As many airports are publicly run and require would-be concessionaires to put in public bids for retail space , and Amazon Go could end up losing out to more established brands . After all , there are currently seven Amazon Go stores dotted around the US , so it 's still early days for the grocery chain , which is reportedly scouting for locations in the UK and other countries . Still , shopping without the hassle of queuing could be fantastic for travelers who are on tight schedules – time will tell if these rumors come to fruition . Via Venture Beat

Picture credit : Amazon Amazon is testing larger version of its automated Amazon Go brick-and-mortar stores , according to sources speaking to the Wall Street Journal ( paywalled ) , meaning you could potentially do your weekly grocery shopping without interacting with another human being . Read more : New World first look Amazon launched its first automated convenience store , Amazon Go , in Seattle earlier this year . There are no checkouts or cashiers – instead , an app on your phone registers as you enter the store , and cameras on the shelves detect the items you take and add them to a virtual basket . When you 've finished choosing your items , leave the store and you 'll be charged for what you 've taken . Back then , Amazon said it had no intention of rolling out the technology to Whole Foods ( the grocery chain it bought for a massive $ 13.7 million last year ) , but apparently it may have changed its mind and is testing `` a larger space formatted like a big store '' . Existing Amazon Go outlets are only the size of a small convenience store . Larger stores with more diverse products mean new challenges , including managing far more products , and dealing with larger spaces that are harder to monitor . The sources claim that Amazon is planning to open as many as 3,000 physical stores by 2021 , enabling it to better compete with big supermarket chains like Walmart ( though Amazon has declined to comment so far ) .

It seems the big tech companies are ready to start being a little friendlier to each other as the holiday season approaches – Apple is flicking the switch to enable Apple Music on Amazon Echo devices , and now Amazon Music is coming to Android TV as well . As Android Police reports , the app is already live in the Play Store . You ca n't actually down and install it yet , but it looks as though Amazon will be pushing it out to the masses in the near future , which means you 'll soon be able to pipe more than two million songs through your Android TV television or set-top box . This is the basic Amazon Music service that 's provided as part of an Amazon Prime subscription , not the Amazon Music Unlimited service that costs more , has a bigger song selection , and is a genuine rival to the likes of Spotify . Spotify is already available on Android TV as a separate app , and Google Play Music is present too ( though not YouTube Music , yet ) . Missing from the Android TV line-up is Apple Music , so this would give Amazon an advantage for Android TV owners . As all Android TV devices have built-in Chromecast functionality anyway , it 's not a huge problem to cast music from a bunch of different apps on a phone . However , having a native app for the platform means everything can be operated and controlled on the big screen – and the Amazon Music Android TV interface looks fairly polished . As yet there 's been no word from Amazon about when the new app might go live , but we 'd expect it to be within the next few days . Keep your eyes on the Google Play Store listing if you 're eager to get hold of the app as soon as possible .

Meet the Amazon Scout , a six-wheeled delivery robot designed to carry your Amazon orders straight to your door . Developed as a ground-level alternative to Amazon 's flying delivery drones , the Scout is effectively an autonomous courier that will navigate the streets rather than the skies . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 As with drones , there 'll be a practical limit to the bots ' carrying capacity – good luck getting it to deliver any furniture – but for small packages or food deliveries , there 's certainly an argument for their use . Amazon has begun limited trials of the Scout in Snolhomish County , Washington State , with Amazon employees supervising the bots to handle any unexpected roadblocks – or , let 's be honest , vandals . You can see the Scout in action in the idyllic promo video below . The Amazon Scout bears an uncanny resemblance to the delivery robots developed by Starship Technologies , an autonomous transport startup created by Skype co-founders Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis . With a similar shape and six-wheel motor , it will be interesting see if Amazon comes up against the same hurdles as Starship – which pulled its robots from larger , congested cities to focus on more rural areas , where its devices could navigate more freely and more directly benefit less-connected communities . Knowing Amazon , it will want to scale up the project as large as it can , though that may change when the Scout has had the chance to do some recon . Via AndroidCentral

Amazon has halted sales of its Echo Wall Clock amid customer reports of connectivity issues . The Echo Wall Clock , which is designed sync up with your Alexa voice-controlled devices to give you some visual feedback on your timers and reminders , has only been on sale in the US for a month , with availability in other territories still to be confirmed . A spokesperson for Amazon said in statement : `` We ’ re aware that a small number of customers have had issues with connectivity . We ’ re working hard to address this and plan to make Echo Wall Clock available again in the coming weeks . ” At just $ 29.99 ( around £26 / AU $ 55 ) , the Echo Wall Clock looks just like a standard clock , but features an LED array , marking down the minutes and seconds . Connect the clock to your Echo devices over Bluetooth , and these LEDs light up to show exactly how long is left on a timer , or until a reminder has counted down . It was launched alongside the Amazon Basics Alexa Microwave in September 2018 , demonstrating how easily voice assistants like Alexa can now be integrated into everyday appliances – if you have a smart speaker to control them with , that is . Right now , it 's not clear when the Echo Wall Clock will go back on sale in the US , or whether these connectivity issues will hinder the device 's release in other countries like the UK and Australia . Unfortunately , you 'll just have to use your regular wall clock to count down the hours until it 's back on sale . Via The Verge

There 's a lot of love for Facebook 's new Portal smart display on Amazon - from Facebook 's own employees , at least . The Portal and Portal+ are Facebook 's attempt to enter the smart home market , with a screen-based smart display to offer video chat services . But it seems some of the more glowing praise found online is from Facebook employees - which they 're not really meant to be doing . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 New York Times columnist @ kevinroose posted the revelation on Twitter , showing how a number of five-star reviews on the Portal 's Amazon product page were signed off by the names of Facebook employees - an accusation confirmed by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth . You can read Bosworth 's comment to Roose 's tweet below . neither coordinated nor directed from the company . From an internal post at the launch : “ We , unequivocally , DO NOT want Facebook employees to engage in leaving reviews for the products that we sell to Amazon. ” We will ask them to take down.January 17 , 2019 Smart displays are big business nowadays , with success of the likes of the Google Home Hub and Amazon Echo Show showing an appetite for tablet-like home appliances . Facebook 's forays into the market , the Portal the Portal+ , did n't receive a huge amount of fanfare at launch , which may have had something to do with ongoing concerns about the company 's use of customer data . Facebook admitted as much , telling news site Recode that `` Portal voice calling is built on the Messenger infrastructure , so when you make a video call on Portal , we collect the same types of information ( i.e . usage data such as length of calls , frequency of calls ) that we collect on other Messenger-enabled devices . '' Whether positive reviews from Facebook 's own employees are enough to allay those fears remains to be seen . Via SlashGear

Amazon is launching a new conference dedicated to AI , robotics and automation , with demonstrations , talks and workshops on the future of technology . The conference is a follow-on from the company 's MARS ( Machine learning , Automation , Robotics and Space ) event – an expenses-paid , invite-only affair where industry leaders could share their visions of the future over a glass or two of bubbly . In fact , MARS was so discreet , it was almost completely secret until CEO Jeff Bezos decided to admit a small handful of reporters in 2018 . The rebranded event , re : MARS , will be open to the public , with speakers from MIT , UC Berkeley , NASA and , of course , Amazon . Sign ups are now open here . “ We ’ re at the beginning of a golden age of AI , '' said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement on the new event 's site . `` Recent advancements have already led to invention that previously lived in the realm of science fiction – and we ’ ve only scratched the surface of what ’ s possible . '' The new event , which will take place at the ARIA resort and casino in the Nevada desert on 4-7 June 2019 , is designed for engineers , developers and business leaders , though Amazon adds in a footnote that astronauts will still get in free .

Amazon has just released Backup , a new offering for Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) which promises 'faster , simpler ' data backup across AWS services , as well as on-premises . Amazon believes offering a single service , where users can configure and audit the AWS resources they backup , will simplify protecting storage volumes , databases , and file systems . To begin with , AWS Backup is integrated with Amazon DynamoDB , Amazon Elastic Block Store ( Amazon EBS ) , Amazon Elastic File System ( Amazon EFS ) , Amazon Relational Database Service ( Amazon RDS ) , and AWS Storage Gateway . The company says additional services are planned for the future , too . Those looking to back up on-premise application data can use the AWS Storage Gateway . Customers can create scripts for automated scheduling , they can enforce retention policies and consolidate back up activities across different services . AWS believes this will help meet regulatory compliance requirements , as well . Amazon offers faster and simpler back up frequency setup , as well as how long the stored data stays before being deleted . “ As the cloud has become the default choice for customers of all sizes , it has attracted two distinct types of builders . Some are tinkerers who want to tweak and fine tune the full range of AWS services into a desired architecture , and other builders are drawn to the same breadth and depth of functionality in AWS , but are willing to trade some of the service granularity to start at a higher abstraction layer , so they can build even faster , ” said Bill Vass , VP of Storage , Automation , and Management Services , AWS . “ We designed AWS Backup for this second type of builder who has told us that they want one place to go for backups versus having to do it across multiple , individual services . Today , we are proud to make AWS Backup available with support for block storage volumes , databases , and file systems , and over time , we plan to support additional AWS services . ''

Starting today , when you ask Alexa on your Amazon Echo speaker “ what ’ s the latest ? ” , you may notice its voice sounds different – or more natural – than before . This is because Amazon has rolled out a fresh new speaking style to Alexa users in the US , modelled on the way newscasters deliver the news . First announced in November 2018 , Amazon ’ s developers utilized developments in Neural TTS ( Text To Speech ) technology to create the updated voice , which allows the voice assistant to tailor its speaking style to different commands and requests . In this case , Alexa ’ s newscaster-style voice has clearer intonation and emphasizes words in a way that sounds less robotic than its default voice . To determine how important a natural-sounding speaking voice is to consumers , Amazon conducted a large-scale experiment , finding that people preferred Alexa ’ s newscaster voice when hearing the news . However , subjects still preferred the voice of a human newcaster over Alexa 's new sound , suggesting consumers still feel more comfortable with voices that sound more like their own . The researchers also experimented with creating a neutral voice for when Alexa reads out Wikipedia entries – but you can hear the different speaking styles via a Soundcloud embed over at TechCrunch . Amazon also noted that researchers were able to train Alexa to use the newscaster voice after just a few hours of feeding it phonemes , – the most basic units of language that distinguish one word for another . ( For example , the letters ' p ' and ' b ' that distinguish the words 'pat ' and 'bat ' are both phonemes . ) In its original statement in November , Amazon said that “ this advance paves the way for Alexa and other services to adopt different speaking styles in different contexts , improving customer experiences . ” It ’ s easy to imagine the different situations this could come in handy , with one application being children ’ s bedtime stories . Although Alexa can already read your child a story – even personalizing it to include their name – how great would it be if it could read in dramatic voices or impersonate different characters ? Alexa can already lower its voice , when it ’ s late at night and you don ’ t want to disturb the people around you . If you enable Whisper mode , Alexa will respond to your hushed tones in a whisper – but like the newscaster voice , the feature is only available in the US right now , with no word on when it will arrive in other territories .

The Amazon Fire TV Stick is getting an upgrade . As of today , anyone who orders the £39.99 / $ 39.99 Fire TV Stick from Amazon will get a beefed up Alexa voice remote bundled in – all at no extra cost . Amazon 's Fire TV sticks function as online streaming devices , allowing you to browse a wide array of streaming services , internet apps , and social media platforms like YouTube , Spotify , Netflix , Amazon Music or Amazon Prime Video . The next-gen Alexa voice remote , which is priced at £29.99 / $ 27.99 individually , builds on the previous remote with additional volume controls , as well as individual mute and power buttons . The new remote is also compatible with other AV equipment connected through your TV – meaning you can turn speakers on and off , or alter the volume on your hi-fi setup through the same remote you control your Fire TV device and Alexa assistant with . We first saw the new remote in 2018 , when it started shipping with the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K – though it will now be packed in with the cheaper HD-capable model too . It will start shipping to UK and US customers on January 23 . If you do n't fancy upgrading to a whole new model just for the remote , though , you can buy the new Alexa voice remote by itself for £14.99 / $ 14.99 ( for as long as the half-price discount currently lasts ) . It 's currently compatible with the Fire TV Stick ( 2nd Gen ) , Fire TV Stick 4K , and Fire TV ( 3rd Gen ) .

You have a smoke detector in your home , and it may even be 'smart , ' but it does n't actually detect fire like the Safer Alarms system we checked out at CES 2019 . There 's a big difference between smoke and fire detectors , according to the CEO of the company with the same name . Read more : Lookout Security and Antivirus `` For 60 years , detectors have been detecting the derivative of fires : smoke , and it 's the smoke that kills you , '' explained Marc Toland , Safer Alarms founder and CEO before going in for the hard sell . `` Why risk inhalation when ... you do n't have to ? '' Safer Alarms , the product , starts shipping in late January and was buried in the South Hall of CES , in a small unassuming meeting room . Surrounded by booths touting copycat drones , it was a hidden gem in the Las Vegas Convention Center . It consists of a heat detector and a companion alarm , and works by having you stick the heat detector in the highest-risk locations in your house : near a washer and dryer , furnace , humidifier , and anywhere in the kitchen or a baby 's bedroom . Once the temperature hits `` the danger zone '' aka 150 degrees F ( 66 C ) , the sensor wirelessly transmits a signal to the companion alarm located in a safe location . That 's the patent pending technology that makes Safer Alarms an intriguing product . `` For the first time , our product allows the consumer to place this sensor in harm 's way , right where fires begin , '' said Toland , who came prepared with two specific examples in his own life that anyone could relate to . `` I 've got an 11-year-old kid , '' he said . `` When she has her friends over and they have a power strip with every charger you can ever imagine plugged into it , it gets hot . So when this reaches the danger zone , and there 's an event – a fire – I 've got it immediately . '' He noted that a signal is wirelessly sent to the remote alarm , which is in a safe traditional location . `` I have a four-year-old , '' said Toland , illustrating another example in his personal life . `` Around her crib is a baby monitor , infrared , humidifier , dehumidifier , etc . And when I put her down for a nap and I shut the door , that traditional smoke detector is outside . So if there 's a problem in my nursery , she 's risking inhalation before I get the alarm . [ With Safer Alarms ] , I 've got you right at the source . '' Did you know you should n't stick a smoke alarm in a laundry room , even though there are 10,000 dryer fires every year in the US alone ? `` As it stands , you 're not supposed to place traditional [ smoke ] detectors anywhere near the potential source of a fire , '' said Toland . `` They get really hot really fast , and fires melt the detectors . They wo n't be effective . That 's why you often see a smoke detector in the middle of the ceiling in a hallway . '' The Safer Alarms CEO promises that his remotely-located alarm transmits a signal before the sensor melts and , even when it does , he says `` we 're still screaming as it goes . '' It also solves the problem of humidity created by washers and dryers , which does n't affect a heat sensor like it can a smoke alarm . Maybe the most convincing thing Toland mentioned was this : `` Most fires happen in the walls first because of the electrical . So you do n't get that smoke billowing out because it 's in the wall and until you 're ablaze . '' The Safer Alarms CEO believes his idea also tackles false detections that leave many smoke detectors uninstalled in critical areas , like kitchens . `` About 80 % of people , when they burn the toast , they take the batteries out and shove them in a drawer . Because we 're a heat sensor , you can blow cigar smoke all day long and we 'll still work . We eliminate those nuisance alarms . '' Safer Alarms has three products shipping in late January , and showed us all three . The 1:1 heat detector and a companion alarm costs $ 69.99 , while the 4:1 package with four heat detectors and a companion alarm costs $ 149.99 . No international pricing or release date has been announced , as Safer Alarms is just getting started in the US . You 're three times more likely to have fire during Christmas , so Safer Alarms also has a clever Christmas tree heat sensor shaped like a Christmas ball . It 's meant to blend into your tree and ornaments with its evergreen green color , and gave Toland the chance to say , `` Christmas trees tend to go up , well , like Christmas trees . '' This sensor is priced at $ 69.99 and comes with its own companion alarm . At CES , the Safer Alarms CEO was pitching to nationwide retailers , though he did n't want to publicly share which at this point . You 'll recognize the names , though . He did also talk up a next-generation product when we asked if it could communicate with a smartphone one day . `` This generation does not . But we will . We 've engineered that into this , '' he said . `` We will be able to do that with next-generation products in the third-quarter [ of 2019 ] . '' It 's not a question of will Safer Alarms sell . If it works as advertised , it may be : will Toland sell ? The idea is already catching the attention of insurance companies . `` Insurance companies ' ears go up , '' said Toland when his conversation with them went from getting people out of a house to also salvaging insured belongings . `` Now we 're talking loss of property . Their ears perked right up and they said 'We 'll mandate this . ' '' The big story at CES 2019 has been the expansion of smart home gadgets , with Apple , Google , and Amazon leading the way . When we asked if he 'd be interested in selling to one of these companies , it seemed to be a yes – with a caveat . `` Right now , there 's a major consolidation , '' he said , citing , `` Google bought Nest , Amazon bought Ring , Newell bought First Alert , and UTC purchased Kidde . '' Toland said he 'd still be interested because it 's about more than money , it 's about market penetration for his life-saving product . `` So yeah , I 'm going to take the check , and yeah , I 'm going to go away . Because what they can do is better than what I can do because they have billions of billions of dollars . `` My goal is , if you ca n't beat them , join them , '' he said , with some hesitation toward a worst case scenario . He does n't want to become `` the Netscape of Microsoft . 'Here 's a billion dollars , ' and they bury my technology . I do n't want that . This saves lives . ''

In a move that will surely upset the open-source community , AWS has launched a new database offering compatible with the MongoDB API called DocumentDB . The cloud giant describes its new product as a “ fast , scalable , and highly available document database that is designed to be compatible with your existing MongoDB applications and tools. ” However , it is essentially a replacement for MongoDB that uses its API but none of its code . According to AWS , its customers have found it difficult to build fast and highly available applications that are able to scale to multiple terabytes with hundreds of thousands of reads and writes per second . So instead , the company built its own document database that is compatible with Apace 2.0 open source MongoDB 3.6 API . This has led to further accusations that AWS is taking the best open-source projects and re-branding them without giving back to the communities responsible for their creation . MongoDB took efforts to stop AWS and others from copying its product by re-licensing its open-source tools under a new license that clearly states that companies trying to use its code to create similar products have to buy a commercial license . MongoDB 's CEO and President Dev Ittycheria responded to the news in a statement to TechCrunch , saying : “ Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , so it ’ s not surprising that Amazon would try to capitalize on the popularity and momentum of MongoDB ’ s document model . However , developers are technically savvy enough to distinguish between the real thing and a poor imitation . MongoDB will continue to outperform any impersonations in the market . ” The company 's Co-Founder and CTO Eliot Horowitz also weighed in on the matter , saying : “ In order to give developers what they want , AWS has been pushed to offer an imitation MongoDB service that is based on the MongoDB code from two years ago . Our entire company is focused on one thing — giving developers the best way to work with data with the freedom to run anywhere . Our commitment to that single mission will continue to differentiate the real MongoDB from any imitation products that come along . ” Time will tell if developers embrace AWS ' DocumentDB but the damage to the open-source community has already been done .

While most of the tech world has its eyes focused on CES 2019 , a new report released today says Amazon could be working on a new game streaming service that will deliver games digitally while running them on cloud servers . That tidbit of news is according to a report on The Information , and while the details are thin , the publication says Amazon could be joining Sony , Google and Nvidia as a game streaming provider as early as next year . So why the skepticism ? The sources that spoke to The Information say that while negotiations are underway , no games or even a firm release date could be confirmed making it hard to corroborate the information with the developers themselves . Should the service pan out , however , Amazon would almost certainly include it on Amazon Fire TV Edition screens and Amazon Fire TV devices , plus tablets and smartphones . No mention was made about a PC version of the service , unfortunately , but it sounds like it 's still heavily under development . It ’ s hard to know outright what Amazon is doing in the games space . On one hand it just cancelled its first project Breakaway back in April of last year , but on the other a move into the streaming side makes sense – the company certainly has the server capabilities and Amazon might want to stay neck-and-neck with the other big tech companies working on streaming . While Amazon has yet to say anything official on the matter , The Verge has noticed a number of postings that corroborate the rumor – including a position for a Cross Platform Game Engineer and two listings that specifically mention cloud games – but we ’ ll have to wait to hear from Amazon before anything ’ s official .

Amazon 's Alexa smart assistant could soon be a core feature for many new cars , with Qualcomm announcing a partnership with the retail giant to bring Alexa to vehicles during CES 2019 . Qualcomm is harnessing the Alexa technology to provide `` intuitive voice-based experiences , such as in-car virtual assistance and natural interactions between the vehicle and driver . '' As well as hopefully making speaking to your car easier , the partnership will also bring Amazon Music , Prime Video , Fire TV and Audible to vehicles as well , opening up new infotainment options - all which can be controlled with voice . It means you 'll be able to use the 'Alexa ' wake-word and ask the smart assistant all the same questions and commands as you can at home with Amazon 's Echo speakers , as well as asking for car-specific functions such as setting up navigation .
LG has taken CES 2019 to announce a wave of new partnerships with major US tech manufacturers , including announcing that Apple AirPlay is coming to its 2019 wave of TVs . Working with the Cupertino company , LG TV owners will be able to stream video from Apple 's library of iTunes TV and movie content , with support for both Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision standards for a premium home cinema experience.. Read more : Apple AirPods ( 2019 ) It 's a rare partnership for Apple , which has usually reserved this sort of support for its own Apple TV hardware . Want to talk to your TV , but do n't want to be locked into just one voice assistant ? LG is also combining both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa smart controls into its 2019 range of ThinQ TVs . LG smart TVs will let you run both Amazon routines and Google Assistant commands in one set , letting you get the best of both smart ecosystems without having to commit to just one . If your life is entwined with Google 's services , you can have Assistant pull in information from your Google account , while Alexa can take charge of your voice shopping experience . Both , naturally , can take command over a host of smart home devices too . Contextual knowledge from the LG ThinQ AI assistant will also intelligently weave the assistant 's together , remembering previous commands so that you can talk in a more natural way to trigger previously or regularly used commands .

Amazon Alexa is in almost everything from microwaves to wall clocks , and the latest addition to that list is a bike . The bike you can see above is part of a new range of cycling products coming later in 2019 called the Cybic Legend . There 's also an electric bike in development called the Cybic E-Legend and both have been announced ahead of being shown at CES 2019 . These are set to be the world 's first bikes that include Amazon 's voice assistant , and it 's there so you can interact with your bike without being distracted when you 're meant to be concentrating on the road in front of you . For example , if it 's starting to get dark on your way home you could have smart lights set up on your bike that you can ask Amazon Alexa to turn on using your voice rather than having to reach to hit a manual switch . The bike is also capable of giving you turn-by-turn directions as well as traffic and weather updates making it even safer to ride the bike . On top of that you 'll be able to use other Alexa Skills so you 'd be able to order food for when you get home , interact with a smart lock and play music directly from your bike too . So far we only know about a UK release for the bike range , but considering the product is set to be on display at CES 2019 in Las Vegas next week we 'd expect it to come to the US too . If you live in the UK , it 's set to be an exclusive at Halfords from summer 2019 . Each bike will come with a Vodafone 3G SIM card so you can have the bike connected , and that will last for three years . The exact specifications of the bike range have yet to be confirmed , and we expect to hear more about that later in 2019 nearer the summer release date .

What 's the good of a clock that ca n't tell the time ? Very little , which was why the Amazon Echo Wall Clock has finally gone back on sale in the US after a timer issue saw the device pulled shortly after its launch . The Amazon Echo Wall Clock , despite being part of the Echo family , has no mic or speaker , but instead pairs up with your Echo device in order for you to trigger timers with your voice . Around the edge of the clock face you get the regular numbered time markers , but also an LED array . And it 's here where the troubles sat : These LEDs represented the current point a timer was at , but users reported the clock would regularly fail to match up with the Alexa timers it had set , even if the actual timekeeping was working correctly . Arguably worse still was the fact that some users were reporting that , should the Echo Wall Clock drop its Bluetooth connection to an Alexa speaker , the only way to fix the issue was to replace its batteries entirely . Now Amazon is confident that its fixed these issues , with an over-the-air firmware update rolling out to existing customers still facing problems . That means the Amazon Echo Wall Clock is back on sale at its original $ 29.99 price point . However , there 's still no word on a UK or European release . Here 's hoping that it was this ( now fixed ) connectivity issue that was preventing a wider roll out , and that we 'll see the Amazon Echo Wall Clock on a wider range of Amazon store territories soon .

After a lengthy public bidding process , e-commerce giant Amazon decided that it would build its new headquarters in not one location but two with its new offices split between Washington , DC and New York City . However , following opposition from residents and local lawmakers , the company has just announced that it is canceling its plans to build a second headquarters in NYC . Amazon explained its decision to abandon its New York headquarters in a statement announcing the cancellation , saying : “ After much thought and deliberation , we ’ ve decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for Amazon in Long Island City , Queens . For Amazon , the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive , collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long-term . While polls show that 70 % of New Yorkers support our plans and investment , a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned in Long Island City . ” Amazon will not be choosing another location for its HQ2 and instead the company will move forward with its existing plans to build out its presence in Northern Virginia and Nashville . The company 's plans to establish a headquarters in Queens were discussed behind closed doors without input from local lawmakers . To make things worse , the city of New York agreed to give Amazon major concessions including $ 1.5bn in incentives in exchange for creating 25,000 jobs . However , these jobs would not be filled by local residents and instead outside talent would be needed to fill the roles . This influx of new people would drive up costs and could even push out long-time residents that are already dealing with gentrification and rising costs . Amazon would likely have had a difficult time getting development started without local support and the project 's costs could have ballooned as a result of legal battles opposing its new headquarters .

Amazon has opened up its US Alexa Store to allow anyone to publish and share Alexa skills created with its 'Blueprints ' program . So far , there 's no word on when this feature will be rolled out to the UK and Australia , but the US launch alone will likely see an influx of new skills becoming available for the voice assistant . Read more : Amazon Echo Show 5 As well as opening up the Alexa Store to have-a-go skill-makers , Amazon is set to launch a number of new Blueprints templates aimed at bloggers and organizations . Blueprints , which was launched last year , allows anyone to make their own skills without the need to be a coding genius , thanks to series of walkthrough templates that allow anyone to knock up a personalized Skill in just a few moments . Save it , send it to the cloud , and within a few minutes , it 's ready to use with your Echo speaker . Using these templates , you can create skills as varied as voice-enabled games , educational tools , and stories to be read aloud by Alexa – and all you need to do is fill out a form with all the features you want your skill to have .

Amazon announced today that it 's buying Eero , a popular mesh router start-up that has made easy-to-setup whole home Wi-Fi without dead zones . It 's a move that `` helps customers better connect to smart home devices , '' according to Amazon 's press release , but really , it 's another way to counter Google 's smart home initiatives , one of the only ones Amazon did n't have an answer for in 2019 . Eero became one of the first companies to sell simple mesh routers in 2016 , with identical routers hubs and beacons that could blanket Wi-Fi throughout a home . Later that same year , Google launched Google Wifi , a rival mesh router that worked the same way out-of-the-box . Little techie knowledge was needed to set it up , too . Of course , pioneering mesh Wi-Fi technology is nothing when you 're going against the likes of Google , so an Amazon acquisition seems to make sense for all parties . Today 's press release notes that the Eero team will be `` joining the Amazon family '' and `` bring Eero systems to more customers around the globe . '' For now , it sounds like Eero will remain a separate company , sort of like Amazon did with Ring . Amazon acquired the smart doorbell maker this same month last year . But one way for Amazon to ensure Eero 's mesh Wi-Fi tech reaches the masses would be to integrate the idea into popular Amazon Echo speakers around a house . It 's not such a crazy idea . The Alexa-enabled Asus Lyra Voice is a wireless tri-band Wi-Fi router already doubles as a smart speaker and is being sold on Amazon today . In the immediate future , you may see Amazon push the existing Eero 2nd gen router hubs and beacons , especially in the lead up to Amazon Prime Day .

After facing opposition from lawmakers and residents , Amazon might not built its second headquarters in New York after all . Sources who are “ familiar with the company ’ s thinking ” spoke to The Washington Post on Friday , and said the e-commerce giant might reconsider its deal in the face of vocal opposition to the deal . Even if the deal falls through with New York , the deal with Virginia would still stand . “ The question is whether it ’ s worth it if the politicians in New York don ’ t want the project , especially with how people in Virginia have been so welcoming , ” a source familiar with the matter told the Post . The blowback began after an anti-Amazon rally that was held the day after the deal was announced and has been a point of contention at local town halls , according to Vox . While the Post ’ s report cited two people who were familiar with the matter , a third has spoken to The New York Times ’ City Hall reporter and said that there were no plans to abandon ship just yet . To that end , Amazon has been issuing statements to media outlets telling them that the company has no plans to remove themselves from the deal and said “ Whether it ’ s building a pipeline of local jobs through workforce training or funding computer science classes for thousands of New York City students , we are working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbor we will be . ” Amazon is set to start construction on its second headquarters in 2020 ... as long as the company decides to stick with its original plans .
As criticism over its facial recognition system Rekognition has grown among lawmakers and consumers alike , Amazon has come out in favor of legislating the technology and has even proposed guidelines on how to do so . In a blog post , Amazon Web Services ' VP of Global Public Policy , Michael Punke laid out five proposed guidelines on how the technology should be used responsibly . However , Punke 's suggestions come at a time when the company has been criticized for selling Rekognition to law enforcement agencies despite the fact that researchers claim to have discovered gender and ethnic biases in the system . Currently there are no federal rules regarding the use of facial recognition technology which is why Washington lawmakers are considering creating their own bill to regulate its use . In his blog post , Punke suggested that federal regulation is necessary to control the use of facial recognition technology , saying : `` We understand why people want there to be oversight and guidelines put in place to make sure facial recognition technology can not be used to discriminate . We support the calls for an appropriate national legislative framework that protects individual civil rights and ensures that governments are transparent in their use of facial recognition technology . '' While Amazon is now supporting the idea of federal regulation , the e-commerce giant has been hesitant to support Washington 's state legislation due to a provision which would require facial recognition software to be open to third-party testing . Facial recognition has huge implications for law enforcement but its potential for misuse is too high for the technology to be used without proper safeguards in place . Via ZDNet

Apple TV is bringing more context to your TV shows and movies - on Amazon Prime Video , at least . Apple 's media player now supports X-Ray on the Amazon Prime Video app , which mines IMDb 's production database to give you more information about your favorite TV shows and films . Read more : Living DNA review X-Ray effectively fills viewers in on what actor is onscreen at any one moment , meaning you do n't need to pause the action and Google the cast members every time you half-recognise an actor 's face . You can also see information on the soundtrack currently playing , or just general tidbits about the show . It 's not a new feature by any means , but seeing it come to Apple TV means it reaches a wider audience . Not every title on Amazon 's streaming service has X-Ray information available , but those that do will bring up the info pane whenever you pause playback , with the option to turn off the feature by clicking on the X-Ray logo . Amazon 's purchase of Internet Movie Database ( IMDb ) back in 1998 was designed to allow Amazon to integrate the information into its own online streaming service . In January 2019 , the partnership went a step further with the launch of IMDb 's Freedive : an ad-supported streaming service of a small catalogue of IMDb-listed films and TV shows . While it might look odd to launch a competing streaming service - available on your browser as well as Fire TV devices - we 're likely to see more integration down the line as Amazon strengthens its foothold in the streaming market . There are only a couple of hundred titles available on Freedive so far , and only in the US at the time of writing - but if we know anything about Amazon , it 's that the company will be looking to scale that up pretty quickly .

The introduction of new e-commerce rules in India has led to widespread disruption on Amazon 's local site which was forced to take down its grocery service as well as remove a number of products such as sunglasses and floor cleaners from its store . India 's new regulations went into effect at midnight on Thursday and the US e-commerce giant began removing products a few hours ahead of the deadline . Back in December , the country changed its foreign direct investment rules for its growing e-commerce sector and the move has drawn fire from Amazon as well as Walmart as the companies look to expand their online presences in India . The new e-commerce investment rules prohibit online retailers from selling products from vendors in which they have an equity interest and making deals with sellers to sell exclusively on a platform is no longer allowed as well . In addition to the removal of products sold by Amazon vendors like Cloudtail , the company 's grocery service , Amazon Pantry , was also discontinued sparking outrage from customers that rely on the site for grocery delivery . Amazon has even forecasted first quarter sales below Wall Street estimates as a direct result of growing uncertainty in India which the company sees as one of its key growth markets . India 's new e-commerce policy was announced after small traders in the country complained that e-commerce giants were creating an unfair marketplace by exercising their control over inventory from affiliated vendors . Amazon and Walmart both unsuccessfully lobbied against the country 's new rules and even pushed for their implementation to be delayed . The future of India 's e-commerce market is in doubt and at this time it is still unclear as to whether the new rules are here to stay . If so , Amazon , Walmart and other foreign businesses looking to expand in the country will have to change their business structures in order to be in compliance with the new rules . Via Reuters
Amazon 's early investment in cloud continues to pay off as AWS ' revenue jumped by 45 percent during Q4 2018 , further cementing its lead over rivals Microsoft and Google . The company 's cloud division managed to beat analysts ' estimates and saw increased sales that reached $ 7.43bn which is up from $ 5.11bn a year ago . AWS now represents 10 percent of Amazon 's total quarterly sales and its cloud business has become crucial to the success of its parent company . The company 's operating income for the quarter was $ 2.18bn and it helped account for 58 percent of Amazon 's overall operating income . At the same time , AWS ' operating margin shrank from 31 percent during Q3 to 29 percent in Q4 . During the company 's quarterly earnings call , Amazon 's CFO Brian Olsavsky explained the reason for AWS ' continued success , saying : `` We are getting more and more creative around getting efficiency up and getting our cost of acquisition down . '' AWS allowed Amazon to gain an early foothold in the cloud infrastructure market with Microsoft and Google trying to play catch up every since . Microsoft may still be smaller than AWS but the company recently announced that Azure 's cloud revenue grew by 76 percent during the last quarter . Amazon 's cloud division made several big announcements this quarter including new computing instances that run on ARM-based server chips , custom-built chips for speeding up AI workloads and a plan to provide hardware bundled with AWS software for enterprise data centers .

Annoyed you can no longer play Mario Kart online without paying for Nintendo 's service ? If you 're an Amazon Prime subscriber , you may be able to get online access for free . Rather than paying the $ 3.99 ( £3.49 / AU $ 5.95 ) monthly fee , Amazon is offering a way to get a whole year of the Nintendo Switch Online service for free . It 's through the company 's Twitch Prime service - which comes as an additional , free extra to Amazon 's service anyway - but it is a little complicated to claim the full year . First off , Twitch is clearly stating this is only available in certain countries . There 's no official list of where you can get it , but we 've heard of those claiming it in the US and in the UK . Secondly , you 'll have to claim the trial in two separate parts . If you head to the Twitch Amazon site you 'll be able to claim this trial at any stage before September 24 this year , and it 'll be for a three month period . Then when you 're 60 days through that trial , you 'll have to head back to the same website to claim the additional nine months . Exactly why the service is doing it in this way is unclear , but you 'll also have to provide payment details to sign up for the initial trial too . By signing up to the trial , it 'll automatically renew so we 'd recommend making a note somewhere that you need to resign up for the second trial to ensure you do n't end up paying for Nintendo Switch Online . You 'll also be able to cancel your trial altogether at any stage if you find you 're not using it . As an added benefit within the Amazon Prime package that already offers a variety of benefits including one-day delivery and access to the company 's streaming service , this may prove useful for a lot of Switch owners .

Amazon has officially closed its deal to purchase wireless mesh router maker Eero for an undisclosed sum , the two companies announced today . In the same motion , both companies promise to keep user network data private , and that Eero will be run autonomously within Amazon . Speaking with The Verge in advance of the deal announcement , Amazon SVP of devices and services Dave Limp said , “ we ’ re not changing a word ” of Eero ’ s privacy policy . If you remember , Amazon announced its purchase of Eero in early February . Since that announcement , worries of privacy have cropped up throughout social media . Eero CEO Nick Weaver doubled down on this pro-privacy stance with both The Verge and in a blog post published to coincide with the purchase announcement . “ If anything , we ’ re just going to strengthen our commitment to both privacy and security , ” Weaver told The Verge . “ We ’ ve got some pretty clear privacy principles that we ’ ve used for developing all of our products , that are the really the underpinnings of everything . Those aren ’ t going to change . ” The fact that the first issue Eero and Amazon have to get in front of with this acquisition is privacy isn ’ t the best look for either party to this deal . Amazon ’ s purchase comes at a time when companies like itself and Google are under more scrutiny than ever regarding how far they ’ re allowed into our private lives via their various devices and services . Inversely , this deal couldn ’ t be better timed for Amazon ’ s smart home ambitions , with the need for powerful and expandable Wi-Fi technology to support a web of connected devices in the home that will only grow in number . Weaver , meanwhile , claims to respect the severity of this decision : “ People are inviting us into their homes , ” Weaver said to The Verge . “ I take that really seriously . ” This sentiment is echoed in his blog post , and much more detailed in exactly how Eero will continue to commit itself to user privacy . Will it be enough to convince existing Eero users to stick around much less assuage new customers ? We ’ ll see whether Amazon ’ s honking $ 100 discount on Eero systems in the US will help with that .
Look out , online shoppers . If you 're looking for the lowest prices out there on a new online purchase , Amazon may no longer be your best bet . According to news source Reuters , the retail giant has relaxed restrictions on third-party sellers featured on its site , which meant they could n't sell their wares for a cheaper price on other rival websites . Amazon gave no immediate explanation for the decision , but the catalyst may have been increasing scrutiny of the online marketplace . US Senator Richard Blumenthal filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission back in December 2018 , pointing to how Amazon could `` stifle market competition '' . It 's highly possible that the trade watchdog has leant on Amazon to ease up its restrictions to make for a fairer online market . If there 's one thing you can rely on Amazon for , it 's the low prices . Due to its aggressive pricing strategies and massive distribution network , Amazon has managed to repeatedly undercut the price tags of items on its online retail rivals – while its scale allows it to offer a staggering range of gadgets , books , and lifestyle purchases . Not to mention Amazon 's highly profitable range of smart speakers – the Amazon Echo , Amazon Echo Dot , and Amazon Echo Plus , to name but a few – or its Amazon Fire TV streaming top-box , all of which are solely available through Amazon 's online site . Even if third-party sellers are now allowed to sell their items for less on another site , it will be difficult for other retailers to gain the same foothold in our online shopping habits . For anyone hoping to curb Amazon 's hold on the market , it may already be too late .

With the popularity of the Amazon Echo Spot and Google Home Mini , it can feel as though smart speakers are getting smaller all the time – but that does n't mean they are getting any more portable . If you 've ever bemoaned the fact that you have to keep your smart speaker plugged in at all times , you 'll be pleased to know that British tech company I-box has announced the launch of five new portable docks that enable cordless operation of the Amazon Echo ( 2nd Gen ) , Echo Dot , Echo Spot and the Google Home Mini . Perhaps most interesting of the new devices is the I-box Vault , which allows you to use the Echo Spot on the move for up to eight hours . The Vault also promises to improve the sound of the mini screen-equipped smart speaker with 12W speakers and a bass radiator built into the dock . Making the Echo Spot portable also has the added bonus of allowing you to wander around your home as you make video calls , as well as letting you stream music and listen to radio stations outside – so long as you 're within Wi-Fi range . As well as the Vault , I-box have also launched the I-box Run and the I-box Release , which work with the latest Amazon Echo Dot . While the Run simply acts as a portable battery base for the Echo Dot , the Release adds 12W stereo speakers and a passive bass radiator , just like the I-box Vault . Both the Run and the Release have a USB charging port , whereas only the Release features an auxiliary audio input to give you another connectivity option when it comes to playing your music . If the larger Amazon Echo ( 2nd Gen ) is your smart speaker of choice , the I-box Surge is the battery base for you ; like the Vault , it offers 8 hours of mains-free playback for your Echo . What if you prefer Google ? You 'll be pleased to know that i-box has also announced the I-box Move , which provides eight hours of portable battery life for your Google Home Mini , giving you access to Google Assistant 's smarts on the go . All five of the new docks come with a USB charging port , which means they can double up as an emergency source of battery for a depleted smartphone – handy if you frequently commute long distances . The Release , Surge and Vault are available now priced $ 77.99 ( £59.99 / around AU $ 110 ) , $ 49.99 ( £39.99 / around $ 75 ) and $ 79.99 ( £59.99 / around AU $ 110 ) , respectively . The Move and Run will both be available on March 30 for £39.99 , with US and Australian pricing to be confirmed . Although I-box is a UK company , the battery bases are available to buy through Amazon or the I-box website , which ships internationally .
When you 're setting up a new streaming device on your TV , there are few things worse than having to type in your Wi-Fi password using a remote control . Well , if you 're thinking of buying the Amazon Fire TV you may not need to do that , thanks to two new updates that add simple Wi-Fi set-up to the streaming box , similar to that offered in Amazon 's newer Echo speakers like the Echo Plus . Now , if you save your Wi-Fi password to your Amazon account , the Fire TV will automatically connect as soon as it detects the network , taking the laborious process of typing in your Wi-Fi password out of the set-up equation . So what 's the catch ? You 'll need to own at least one device that supports simple set-up already , like the Amazon Smart Plug or Amazon Echo Show . This is because you need to have previously logged into your Wi-Fi connection with a compatible Amazon device for the feature to work . According to AFTV News , you 'll also need to purchase your new Fire TV device from Amazon , as those devices come `` pre-registered to the buyer ’ s Amazon account , which then allows it to pull down the customer 's stored Wi-Fi password during its initial setup '' . Supported Fire TV devices include the Fire TV Stick , Fire TV Cube , and the Fire TV Stick 4K – so , if you 're thinking of purchasing one and you already have a compatible Echo device at home , you could be in for a pain-free set-up .

If you have a Roku TV or streaming device like the Roku Streaming Stick+ , you can now control it using Alexa – as long as you have an Alexa-enabled smart speaker , that is . This is thanks to a brand-new Alexa skill , which you can set up by opening the Alexa app on your smartphone , heading to settings , and selecting 'TV & Video ' . Once there , you can enable the Roku skill and link it to your account . As Alexa is n't built directly into Roku devices , you will need a compatible speaker like the Amazon Echo , Echo Dot , or Echo Show to use this new skill . Roku says that you can `` pause a show , launch a streaming channel , and search for entertainment '' , by saying things like `` Alexa , find comedies on Roku '' , or `` Alexa , pause Roku . '' This is n't the only way you can control your Roku device with your voice , however . Roku devices were recently updated with a new Enhanced Voice Search feature , so users can search for their favorite shows and movies by speaking directly into the Roku mobile app – or the remote , if you 're using the Roku Streaming Stick+ . So , why bother creating an Alexa skill when Roku already has a form of voice search ? Senior vice president of Roku OS , Ilya Asnis explains that it 's about flexibility . “ Consumers often have multiple voice ecosystems in their homes , '' Asnis said in a press release announcing the feature . `` By allowing our customers to choose Alexa , in addition to Roku voice search and controls , and other popular voice assistants , we are strengthening the value Roku offers as a neutral platform in home entertainment . ” If you 're already using Alexa to control other aspects of your smart home , it might be useful to keep your streaming device in the same smart family . Right now , the Alexa skill is only available in the US , with no word yet on when it will become available in other territories .

How would you feel about picking up your weekly groceries from a physical Amazon store in the future ? The tech giant already owns Whole Foods in the US but is now being tipped to open its own line of stores , perhaps as early as this year . The report comes from `` people familiar with the matter '' speaking to the Wall Street Journal , so do n't take it as a given just yet – but the WSJ does have a solid record when it comes to these sort of scoops . Apparently the new stores will differ from Whole Foods by stocking a different mix of products at lower price points , including groceries and health and beauty products . A pick up service will be available too . According to the WSJ , the first store could open in LA before the end of this year , with more locations following – San Francisco , Seattle , Chicago , Washington DC and Philadelphia are the other US cities that have been mooted . The WSJ report also reveals that the sites would be around half the size of a standard grocery store in the US , and that Amazon might consider acquiring another company to help build up the number of stores . It 's not clear whether the initiative will expand to other countries at the moment , or if the proposed stores are going to carry Amazon branding . The company has already experimented with a few Amazon Go automated convenience stores already . Whether or not we 'll see the same kind of automated checkout system that the Amazon Go stores use in these new grocery locations is also something that remains to be seen . All we know for sure is that Amazon is keen to sell you as much stuff as it possibly can . As is the norm , Amazon has refused to comment on the report , except to say it does n't comment on rumors or speculation . Watch this space for some Amazon grocery spaces appearing in the next few months . Via TechCrunch

Amazon has discontinued its Dash Buttons , which allowed time-pressed customers to order laundry detergent , cat food or macaroni cheese with a single press . As CNET reports , Amazon has decided to stop selling the devices , which retailed for $ 4.99/£4.99 ( about AU $ 7 ) each , and gave a discount of that much off your first order . Dash Buttons launched in 2015 . The self-adhesive controls were intended to be stuck in a convenient place so you can re-order an item the moment you realize you 're running low . When you hit one , your account would be charged and the item would be dispatched post-haste . Dash Buttons were certainly convenient , but not everyone was a fan . Earlier this year , German courts ruled that the devices violated the country 's consumer protection laws . The buttons do n't show the product 's price , and the fact that Amazon 's prices fluctuate frequently means that customers do n't know how much they 'll be paying when they hit it , or if they could get a better deal elsewhere . If that does n't bother you , and you already own a Dash Button , do n't worry – it wo n't stop working , and will still allow you to order guitar strings , Doritos and Nerf darts in one second flat .

Vimeo has announced a new feature called Showcase that will allow users to display their videos on their own smart TV channels via Roku or Amazon Fire TV . In a blog post , the video-sharing platform said that “ Showcase provides a toolkit to create custom viewing experiences for your audience ” , and is aimed at freelancers “ looking to impress prospective clients ” , artists or educators who want to “ establish and online presence , and marketers who are seeking to promote their products or brand . The new feature is described as a “ toolkit ” that lets users create a portfolio or video site , create embeddable playlists , and make their own smart TV apps for Roku or Amazon Fire TV – although , for the smart TV feature , you will need a Pro Vimeo account , which costs $ 20 / £16 ( around AU $ 28 ) per month . Vimeo says that it ’ s also working on more Showcase features included live-streaming support and more embeddable layouts so users will have more options when it comes to embedding their videos into their websites . The ability to create Amazon Fire TV and Roku channels could prove extremely useful for content creators , particularly if they want their work to reach a wider audience . It could also signal the beginning of the smart TV channel as a platform for creatives , instead of something relegated to the likes of Netflix , Hulu , and upcoming streaming platform , Disney+ .

Amazon is apparently gearing up to release a Hi-Res Audio music streaming platform , according to a report by Music Business Worldwide . MBW says that Amazon is `` currently in discussion with various large music rights-holders regarding the upcoming launch of a high fidelity music streaming platform '' and claims that `` at least one major record company '' is already on board . Citing `` several high-placed music industry sources '' , MBW describes the service as a `` new tier '' of Amazon Music Unlimited , and says that it will `` likely be in the region of $ 15 per month '' . This works out at around £11 / AU $ 20 based on current conversion rates . Hi-Res Audio is lossless audio capable of reproducing the full range of sound from recordings that have been mastered from better-than-CD quality music sources ; a sound that closely replicates the quality that the musicians and engineers were working with in the studio at the time of recording . Currently Tidal is the best known music streaming service for Hi-Res Audio – you need to subscribe to Tidal 's 'Hi-Fi tier ' to get access to Tidal Masters . For $ 19.99 ( £19.99 / AU $ 23.99 ) per month , you get access to around 30,000 Hi-Res tracks as well as HD videos . If Amazon can undercut this price while providing the same amount of content , Tidal could be in trouble . So far , Spotify and Apple Music have n't ventured into the world of Hi-Res Audio , perhaps in an effort to keep their subscription costs low . However , if Amazon 's rumored Hi-Res Audio streaming service becomes a reality , we could see other platforms stepping up the quality of their tracks . The rumors of a new Amazon Music Unlimited tier comes after the company announced Echo users in the US will be able to use part of Amazon Music for free . This includes any US user with a Amazon Echo , Amazon Echo Dot , Amazon Echo Show and Amazon Echo Plus , who will be able to use a limited part of Amazon Music Unlimited right out of the box , without signing up for Prime Music through Amazon Prime , which costs $ 119 / £79 per year or AU $ 6.99 per month , or Amazon Music Unlimited ( $ 7.99 / £7.99 per month for Prime members , $ 9.99 / $ 9.99 / AU $ 11.99 for non-Prime members ) .

Concerns around privacy are never too far away from conversations around Amazon 's Alexa voice assistant and Amazon Echo speakers – after all , it 's built to listen ( albeit only after its wake word is spoken ) . However , a Bloomberg report now suggests that Amazon employees can gain access to some sensitive data belonging to Alexa users . The report cites sources that claim an Amazon team that audits Alexa user 's commands can gain access to location data , including a customer 's home address . The international team analyses portions of voice recordings , manually transcribing and annotating them to improve the performance of Alexa . While the data connected to these audio snippets , such as device ID and customer identification number , are difficult to link to an individual , geographic data ( stored in Amazon 's system as longitude and latitude co-ordinates ) does allow for more precision . In the Bloomberg report , a source was alleged to have tied all the data together and bring up what could be a user 's house on Google Maps . Likewise , the tools the 'annotators ' and 'verifiers ' use can reveal contact names , numbers and email addresses to the team , providing they 've been shared by the user . It allows the team to pair names to requests that have proved problematic , such as voice-calling a named contact . Amazon responded to the report with the following statement : “ Access to internal tools is highly controlled , and is only granted to a limited number of employees who require these tools to train and improve the service by processing an extremely small sample of interactions . `` Our policies strictly prohibit employee access to or use of customer data for any other reason , and we have a zero tolerance policy for abuse of our systems . We regularly audit employee access to internal tools and limit access whenever and wherever possible . ”

Amazon has announced that Echo owners will be able to use part of Amazon Music for free . The new , free service doesn ’ t require an Amazon Prime subscription and can be used to access playlists or start new stations by saying `` Hey , Alexa , '' and then a music genre or artist name . The caveat here is that this new tier of Amazon Music is only available in the US at launch , and the service is fairly minimal . For instance , you do n't get on-demand access to Amazon 's entire library , and you ’ re going to hear ads in between songs . The good news is that you ’ ll be able to use it on all US Alexa devices – including the Amazon Echo , Amazon Echo Dot , Amazon Echo Show and Amazon Echo Plus – right out of the box , without signing up for Prime Music through Amazon Prime ( $ 119 per year ) or Amazon Music Unlimited ( $ 7.99 per month for Prime members , $ 9.99 for non-Prime members ) . While this is certainly a step forward for Amazon – giving things away for free is n't usually its strong suit – but it comes just one day after Google announced that YouTube Music would be available for free on every Google Home speaker . The difference here is that YouTube Music allows you to play music on-demand from YouTube Music 's massive catalog . Google still puts ads in-between songs , but it ' s still a far more appealing offer than Amazon 's fairly limited service . Google 's offer is clearly better but in today 's era of subscription everything , we 'll take the free things wherever we can get them .

After a year of feuding , Amazon and Google have finally broken the virtual trade embargo between the two companies , Amazon has announced . Starting later this year , Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV Cube will have access to YouTube via the native YouTube app , and you ’ ll be able to watch Amazon Prime Video on Google Chromecast . In broad terms , that means you ’ ll be able to watch everything available on Amazon ’ s video service on Android TV , Chromecast and Google Home Hub devices ( as well as any other device that supports Chromecast Built-in ) , plus watch YouTube on Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV Edition Smart TVs , with support for the YouTube TV and YouTube Kids apps coming later this year . While this will be a big change for Amazon Prime Video watchers who haven ’ t been able to cast Amazon content to their screens since , well , ever , it might be less of a boon for Amazon device owners who have been able to watch YouTube through the Amazon Silk browser , despite Google pulling the native YouTube app last year . The native YouTube app not might have been missed , but YouTube TV and YouTube Kids certainly have , so there 's something to be gained by both sides . There is one caveat , however : the only device that seems to be left out of the agreement is the Amazon Echo Show , which likely won ’ t have YouTube returned to it at all – a strange move everything considered . While the war between the two tech giants has been brewing for what seems like forever , the battle came to a head when Google pulled YouTube from the Amazon Fire TV – likely in response to Amazon 's refusal to sell Chromecast , Nest and Google Home Devices on the Amazon store . Amazon resumed sales of those products after the YouTube app was pulled , but neither company allowed their services to be used by the other with customers feeling the brunt of the software embargo . The easing of tensions today represents a period of Detente for the companies and could be the foundation of a long-lasting peace ... as long as Amazon keeps selling Google products .
Amazon is planning to close its online store in China after more than a decade of trying to gain a foothold in the country . The ecommerce giant will shutter its domestic marketplace which allowed shoppers to buy from local sellers on its site . Chinese shoppers however will still be able to order products from Amazon 's global store once its local store closes in July and the company will continue to operate its cloud business in China . Despite its popularity in the West , Amazon has struggled to carve out a place for itself in China where it faces stiff competition from local rivals Alibaba and JD.com . The news that Amazon will close its domestic marketplace in China by mid-July was first reported by Reuters which revealed that the company would instead focus on the more lucrative businesses of selling overseas goods and cloud services in the region . According to a company spokesperson , Amazon is currently “ working closely with our sellers to ensure a smooth transition and to continue to deliver the best customer experience possible . ” The company 's Chinese ambitions began back in 2004 when it purchased the local books , music and video retailer Joyo.com for $ 75m and then rebranded the site as Amazon.cn in 2007 . As Amazon has shifted its focus from China , the ecommerce giant has begun to invest heavily into its business in India . The company has committed to spend $ 5.5bn on ecommerce in India to better compete against its local rival there , Flipkart . Via The BBC

The music streaming wars are n't offer yet , with Amazon reportedly in talks with the big labels about offering an free , ad-supported service to take on Spotify – and it might be launching as early as next week . That 's according to sources speaking to Billboard . Apparently the new service will offer a limited selection of songs but would n't cost users anything – a bit like the free tier that Spotify offers . The new service sounds a lot like Amazon Prime Music , the music selection you get as part of a Prime subscription – only in this case you 'd have to listen to ads instead of signing up for Amazon Prime . Amazon Prime Music offers access to around 2 million tracks , and there 's also an Amazon Music Unlimited service , a more direct Spotify competitor – it has tens of millions of songs in its catalog and costs an additional monthly fee . It 's easy to see where the new service would slot in – on Amazon Echo devices . Right out of the box users would be able to start playing music without making any payments or signing up for another service . You 've currently got a whole host of ways to play music through an Echo , including connecting a phone via Bluetooth or adding Apple Music or Spotify through the Alexa app on your phone . This new service , if it actually appears , would in theory be more convenient than those options – at least for the casual music listener who only wants to hear a couple of the latest hits every now and again . If Billboard is right and the service does launch next week , Spotify will no longer be the only music streaming service offering a free , ad-supported tier . Via Engadget

Success and failure often go hand in hand according to Jeff Bezos , founder of Amazon and Blue Origin , who recently told shareholders that the company needs to “ occasionally have multi billion-dollar failures ” to ensure that it is “ experimenting at the right scale ” for a business of its size . In his annual letter to shareholders , Bezos reminded them of how the tech giant 's Fire Phone failed miserably while its Echo line of smart speakers has done incredibly well despite being a huge departure from the company 's product lineup at launch , saying : “ Development of the Fire phone and Echo was started around the same time . While the Fire phone was a failure , we were able to take our learnings ( as well as the developers ) and accelerate our efforts building Echo and Alexa . No customer was asking for Echo . This was definitely us wandering . Market research doesn ’ t help . If you had gone to a customer in 2013 and said “ Would you like a black , always-on cylinder in your kitchen about the size of a Pringles can that you can talk to and ask questions , that also turns on your lights and plays music ? ” I guarantee you they ’ d have looked at you strangely and said “ No , thank you . ” ” While the Echo certainly paid off better in the long run than the Fire Phone , both projects are prime examples of how Amazon has taken risks on innovative projects that sometimes pay off and sometimes do n't . Only 35,000 Fire phones were sold in total according to The Guardian whereas Amazon has sold over 100m Echo Alexa-enabled devices with over 150 third-party products available . Bezos also hailed the success of its 10 automated Amazon Go stores saying 90 percent of retail is still offline . He ended his letter by explaining how the majority of merchandise sold through Amazon is offered by third-parties while challenging competitors such as Walmart to match or beat Amazon 's $ 15-per-hour minimum wage .

The US Department of Defense has revealed that Amazon and Microsoft have been chosen to continue competing for the Pentagon 's $ 10bn cloud computing contract . This means that Oracle and IBM are officially out of the running for the Defense Department 's Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud ( JEDI ) contract that is part of the Pentagon 's broad modernization effort of its IT systems . Department spokesperson Elissa Smith confirmed that AWS and Microsoft are now the only two companies left in the running for the lucrative JEDI contract in a statement , saying : “ I can confirm that AWS ( Amazon Web Services ) and Microsoft are the companies that met the minimum requirements outlined . ” Last year during its request for bidders , the Pentagon said that the contract for cloud computing services could be worth as much as $ 10bn over a 10-year period . When the JEDI contract was first announced , AWS , IBM , Microsoft and Oracle were considered front runners though at the time , AWS was the only company with government approval to handle secret and even top secret data . Due to the size and complexity of the deal , the earliest a contract will be awarded is likely in mid-July . However , there is still an ongoing investigation into Oracle 's claims that AWS was given an unfair advantage in the bidding process . Oracle has taken issue with the fact that a former Amazon employee who worked on the JEDI contract recused himself from his position and then later went back to work at AWS . According to Smith though , a department review of the acquisitions process did not uncover any potential ethical violations . Via Reuters
Amazon employees could be listening to recordings of Echo speaker users ' conversations with Alexa , according to a report by Bloomberg . The report details how teams listen to `` voice recordings captured in Echo owners ’ homes and offices '' in a bid to improve the way Alexa understands speech and responds to commands and questions . These recordings are apparently `` transcribed , annotated and then fed back into the software as part of an effort to eliminate gaps in Alexa ’ s understanding of human speech and help it better respond to commands '' , as part of the `` Alexa voice review process '' . Bloomberg says that it spoke to seven people who `` have worked on the program '' , which reportedly comprises `` a mix of contractors and full-time Amazon employees who work in outposts from Boston to Costa Rica , India , and Romania '' If the claims that humans are reviewing recordings of our interactions with Echo speakers proves to be true , it could be a concerning insight into how artificially intelligent voice assistants are trained by companies , as well as a potential security issues for users . Bloomberg says that the workers parse `` as many as 1,000 audio clips per shift '' and that Amazon employees `` occasionally pick up things Echo owners likely would rather stay private [ like ] a woman singing badly off key in the shower '' . Even more concerning is the claim that these workers have been privy to recordings of `` possibly criminal '' acts . Engadget has reported that `` two workers from Romania said they had to listen to what could 've been sexual assault '' and that `` they were apparently told that they could n't do anything about it , because it 's not Amazon 's job to interfere '' . The reports raise questions as to the legality of failing to report a potential crime , as well questions about the possible ramifications for Amazon employees who could well be distressed by hearing this kind of recording . Amazon has admitted to using human workers to annotate voice recordings . A spokesperson for the company released the following statement : “ We take the security and privacy of our customers ’ personal information seriously ” . `` We only annotate an extremely small sample of Alexa voice recordings in order [ to ] improve the customer experience . For example , this information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems , so Alexa can better understand your requests , and ensure the service works well for everyone . '' Amazon also said that employees `` do not have direct access to information that can identify the person or account '' when annotating voice recordings . Even so , it 's concerning to think that private conversations could be listened to by employees if Alexa is accidentally woken after misinterpreting regular speech as its wake word , 'Alexa ' .

Echos are for people who want to set kitchen timers and listen to music through tiny speakers , right ? Until Amazon 's September event , that 's how many music fans would have described Amazon 's line-up of Alexa-powered Echo speakers . That 's now all changed with Amazon 's introduction of a clutch of hi-fi components – the Echo Input and Echo Sub , but more importantly , Echo Link and Echo Link Amp – that together have the potential to take Alexa to every speaker , amplifier , hi-fi system and TV in every room in a house . Read more : I-box Century review Did Amazon just make a play for the entry-level audiophile market – and take a huge swipe at Sonos along the way ? You bet your soundbar it did . [ Update : The Amazon Echo Link Amp is now available to purchase on Amazon , and both the Echo Link Amp and the Echo Link are available now in the UK , Germany , Japan , India , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . ] Although Amazon did unveil new versions of its Echo Dot and Echo Plus both with upgraded speakers , true audiophiles will rightly ignore them as being about convenience-over-quality . That 's not the case with the Echo Input , a speaker-less dongle that lets you add Alexa to an existing speaker for a paltry $ 34.99/£34.99/AU $ 55 . This tiny , black or white Google Chromecast Audio-like device attaches to any hi-fi equipped with a 3.5 mm jack , but also wirelessly to Bluetooth speakers , essentially bringing all the features of the Echo Dot to any speaker in a home . `` Amazon 's Echo Input adds far-field Alexa experiences to existing connected devices such as Bluetooth speakers , your old home stereo or even your big-screen TV with an input jack , '' explains Werner Goertz at analyst firm Gartner . It 's got four microphones , but crucially the Echo Input allows any speaker to be added to a multi-room music set-up . However , the announcement of the Echo Input – currently only available via invitation – proved a mere aperitif for audiophiles . Since poor bass response has so far kept the Echo family of devices firmly away from the attentions of those after excellent sound quality , it 's no surprise to see Amazon announce Echo Sub . This subwoofer , available in October , has a six-inch woofer and 100W power . It 's for pairing with Echo or Echo Plus , and available either separately or with two Echo devices to create a quick 2.1 streaming system . Clever as that seems , however , a 2.1 setup that uses Echos is only going to suit a small room or living area . The serious audiophile gear comes with the arrival or the Echo Link ( $ 199.99/£189.99 /AU $ 299 ) and the Echo Link Amp ( $ 299.99/£289.99/AU $ 459 ) . Both support for multi-room music through Alexa , but also bring simple voice control of volume for an otherwise firmly analogue setup that presently includes only a record player . In marked contrast to most of the Echo family so far , these are serious and well-equipped pieces of equipment . For example , the Echo Link ( available later this year in the U.S. ) for connecting to an existing amplifier has ins and outs for optical , coaxial and analogue audio , a 3.5 mm headphone jack , and a subwoofer line out . There 's also an Ethernet port and a volume knob . The Echo Link Amp ( available in early 2019 ) for connecting to passive loudspeakers adds a built-in 60W , 2-channel amplifier with left/right speaker terminals . Naturally , voice can be used to select music , change the volume , or configure multi-room options on the Echo Link and Echo Link Amp using the Alexa app or another Echo device . Critically for audiophiles , the latter contains a high-res 24-bit DAC , so expect it to access to Tidal 's lossless audio music streaming service . Amazon 's decision to go for the audiophile market is a direct attack on a market – multi-room music – that 's currently dominated by Sonos ( whose Sonos Amp is out in December ) . However , it 's also an effort to get into a market ahead of its other rivals . “ The focus on audio products and accessories with the Echo Sub , Echo Link and Echo Link Amp will help Amazon deliver higher-end audio experiences in the face of competition from Apple ’ s HomePod , Sonos products and even Google with the Home Max , '' says Geoff Blaber , Vice President Research , Americas at CCS Insight . “ It 's notable that Amazon is not just relying on pre-integration in new products , but enabling existing home appliances and devices through connectors and adapters in an effort to drive utility and usage . ” Can Amazon challenge Sonos ? Absolutely it can , and its offering of good value , modular multi-room music with voice-control baked-in will prove irresistible for some . If Echo Dot is the entry-level , then this is the next logical step up . There is one big question : does your average hi-fi enthusiast care about voice control ? Or multi-room ? I 'm not convinced they do … yet . I would n't be surprised if the Echo Link and Echo Link Amp remain niche products and have a limited shelf-life . But a lot will depend on sales of the Echo Input , which will introduce – for a low price – the concept of voice control to many music fans . Amazon probably know that already ; this is largely about ‘ Alexa everywhere ’ . `` Amazon 's announcements are sharp reminders to Apple and Google that Alexa has a significant lead that it is working meticulously to maximize , '' says Blaber . `` The Echo is now just one of many control points as rivals are still boarding the smart speaker bandwagon . '' So this is about extending its dominance in smart speakers , sure , but it 's mostly about one thing : Amazon wants to get Alexa everywhere as soon as possible so it becomes the default way of controlling … well , everything . Including your kitchen and your car .

As the popularity of 'true wireless ' earphones continues to surge , all the major players in the tech world are scrambling to front their own entry in the race . Apple recently launched the second generation of its popular AirPods , and companies like Jaybird , Jabra and Sony are producing potent competitors in the field , each with several iterations at this point – and now it looks like Amazon wants to join the party . Bloomberg reports that “ people with knowledge of [ Amazon ’ s ] plans ” claim that the tech giant is looking to launch Alexa-enabled earbuds as early as the second half of 2019 , with similar design and functionality to Apple ’ s AirPods , but sporting improved audio quality . According to the same sources , these true wireless earbuds are “ one of the most important projects at Amazon ’ s Lab126 hardware division ” , and will feature full integration of Alexa voice support , allowing users to check the weather , order goods from Amazon , give commands and take notes on the go , hands-free . For people that actually still like to use their hands , these earbuds will also allegedly support physical gestures – likely tapping – to answer or hang up on calls , skip songs and the like . While Amazon has already entered into the smart home arena with its Echo range of smart speakers , this new product would mark its first foray into the realm of portable , personal audio – but it ’ s certainly a move that makes sense , given the increasingly global presence of its Amazon Alexa assistant . Little is known about the finer details of Amazon 's new Alexa buds – or indeed if they will even make it to market – but as always , we 'll keep our ear to the ground for any further news , rumors or leaks .

Amazon has reportedly expressed interest in buying Boost Mobile from US carriers T-mobile and Sprint as the ecommerce giant looks to expand its current offerings . According to Reuters , two sources familiar with the matter revealed that Amazon is considering buying the prepaid wireless service as the deal would grant it access to use new T-Mobile 's wireless network for at least six years . New T-Mobile is the name T-Mobile and Sprint are currently using to refer to the new entity that will result from the potential merger of the two US telecoms . Additionally , Amazon is also interested in purchasing any wireless spectrum that could be made available as a result of the merger . The question as to why Amazon would be interested in purchasing the wireless network and spectrum remains unclear but the company has been known to explore new ventures . Providing wireless service in addition to its current offerings could help it better compete against Google and other tech giants . As part of their planned $ 26bn merger , T-Mobile and Sprint have already pledged to sell Boost to reduce their market share in the prepaid wireless business as they seek regulatory approval for the deal . The two carriers are also considering selling off wireless spectrum to help the merger get approved . If approved , the merger would leave the US with three wireless carriers instead of four and this has raised concerns among consumer advocates that the deal could lead to an increase in wireless prices . The sale of Boost Mobile could earn T-Mobile and Sprint up to $ 3bn according to potential bidders . Via Reuters

Amazon ’ s range of Fire HD tablets aren ’ t exactly processing powerhouses , nor are they portable cinemas or games consoles – but you wouldn ’ t expect them to be at their incredibly low price tag . Costing less than all but the cheapest smartphones , the Amazon Fire HD tablets are definitely affordable , and still pretty decent devices despite this . So if you ’ re on the market for a new tablet but don ’ t want an expensive iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 , you may want to consider an Amazon Fire HD tablet . But which one is best for you ? We compare the two larger configurations , Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 , to show you the difference between them . The Amazon Fire HD 10 is a bigger device , so naturally you ’ re going to be paying a bit more for it . It comes in two sizes , one with 32GB internal memory which costs $ 150 / £150 ( around AU $ 215 ) , and another with 64GB onboard storage , which will set you back $ 190 / £180 ( roughly AU $ 275 ) . The Fire HD 10 represents a step up from the Fire HD 8 , both in terms of price and storage – the latter has a 16GB memory version worth $ 80 / £80 ( roughly AU $ 115 ) and a bigger 32GB model for $ 110 / £100 ( about AU $ 160 ) . Those prices may be cheap , but with Amazon Prime Day just around the corner , you can expect to see the tablets for sale with even smaller price tags very soon . The names of the Amazon Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 don ’ t correspond with the name of the generation , like it would for say the iPhone 11 , but with the size of the screen , same as for tablets like the iPad Pro 12.9 . Since the screen is bigger , the body of the Amazon Fire HD 10 is a little bigger too – with dimensions of 262 x 159 x 9.8mm , it ’ s a larger beast than the Fire HD 8 at 214 x 128 x 9.7mm , and similarly the weights of 500g against 369g show the Fire HD 10 as the bulkier slate . That ’ s basically the only design difference between the tablets though – both have plastic bodies with 3.5mm headphone jacks , 2MP cameras , and microUSB ports . No , they ’ re not as specced-out as other tablets or even most phones , but that matches the price point . One minor design difference is in the available colors – while the Fire HD 8 is available in black , yellow , red or blue , the Fire HD 10 doesn ’ t offer the yellow version , so if you absolutely need the brightest tablet , you ’ ll have to stick with the Fire HD 8 . As we ’ ve previously mentioned , the titular difference between the tablets is the display size , as the Amazon Fire HD 8 ’ s screen is eight inches across diagonally , while the Fire HD 10 ’ s display is – you guessed it – a 10-inch panel . This difference is matched in resolution , as the Fire HD 8 is 800 x 1280 pixels with a pixel density of 189 pixels per inch ( ppi ) whereas the Fire HD 10 is 1920 x 1200 pixels and 224ppi – this means that not only is the Fire HD 10 ’ s screen a little bigger , but it ’ s also better quality , so if having the best screen is important to you , you should check out this tablet first . The size is basically the only difference though – both tablets have LCD screens , which is fairly low-end in terms of display tech . The tablets have different battery sizes – while the Amazon Fire HD 8 has a 3210mAh power pack , the Fire HD 10 boasts 3830mAh , however because of the different screen sizes , we found in effect the slates last around the same amount of time in day-to-day use . Similarly the charging rate was rather similar , that is to say both tablets charge painfully slowly . When we powered both up from 0 % power to 100 % , the Fire HD 8 took 6 hours while the Fire HD 10 took 5 hours , and both of which is incredibly slow compared to other tablets , likely thanks to the microUSB charging port . Neither of the tablets are processing powerhouses , with middling chipsets powering each . The Fire HD 8 comes with a Mediatek MT8163 processor , while the Fire HD 10 has the slightly better Mediatek MT8173 – when we put both tablets through benchmarking tests , the former returned a poor 1,677 while the latter came back with a 3,021 average . The latter is average for a low-end phone , but the former is rather poor by any standards . The low processing power may come to a head when trying to play demanding games or run many apps at once , but if you ’ re buying an Amazon Fire HD tablet you probably don ’ t need the 10,000-plus scores of iPad Pros , so this won ’ t be as much of a problem . When put head-to-head , though , you 're not going to notice a difference between the Fire HD tablets , as the similarly low benchmark scores and RAM in both ( 1.5GB RAM for the Fire HD 8 and 2GB RAM in the Fire HD 10 ) handle tasks with very little speed difference . The deciding difference between the devices is in the screens , as the Amazon Fire HD 10 has a bigger and better display . That said , it ’ s a little more expensive , so you need to decide if the extra cost is worth the better screen . In other ways , the tablets are very similar , both in terms of battery performance and design feel , so you ’ ve not got much to decide between the two if you don ’ t care about how big the slate is .
Following recent privacy concerns suggesting that Amazon employees may be listening to your recorded Alexa conversations , the online retail giant has announced new voice commands that will give users more control over their recordings . In its newly launched 'Alexa Privacy Hub ' , Amazon states that users may now scrap their recorded voice history daily by saying `` Alexa , delete everything I said today ” . A second command , “ Alexa , delete what I just said ” , will roll out within the next month . Of course , there are some necessary steps that must be taken before the commands will actually work : users must first access their Alexa Privacy Settings , click on 'Review Voice History ' and flip the 'Enable deletion by voice ' toggle to 'on ' . There is one small catch though , as enabling the feature will allow `` anyone with access to your Alexa devices '' to delete your Alexa voice recordings , which does n't sound like a big deal to us . Alexa device owners may also use the same page to access a drop down menu that allows them to delete voice data from specific dates or even their entire voice recording history – a much easier alternative to the previous method of deleting voice recordings one-by-one via the Alexa app . While it 's nice to see Amazon be more transparent about its practices and give customers more control over their data , we have to wonder whether it will be enough to assuage users ' privacy concerns in the long run .

Phones being listed by retailers before they ’ ve been announced isn ’ t totally unheard of , but the Moto Z4 wasn ’ t just listed on Amazon , it was seemingly sold and shipped to a customer . The listing has of course been removed , but someone going by the username JETFIRE007 received the handset and posted information on Reddit and a hands-on video on YouTube , so we now have a very good idea of what to expect from the Moto Z4 . As you can see in the video , the design looks much as we ’ d expected from rumors , with a small notch at the top housing a single-lens camera , and a tiny bit of bezel below the screen . On the back there ’ s another single-lens camera , this time in a circular camera block , and lower down there ’ s a Moto Mod connector . Notably the phone also has a headphone port . As for specs , the Moto Z4 apparently has a 6.4-inch 1080 x 2340 screen , 4GB of RAM , a Snapdragon 675 chipset , 128GB of storage , a 48MP rear camera ( which uses Quad Pixel technology to take extra-detailed 12MP photos ) , a 25MP front-facing camera , an in-screen fingerprint scanner , a 3,600mAh battery , and a microSD card slot . Moving on to the price , the Moto Z4 was listed on Amazon at $ 499 ( roughly £395/AU $ 720 ) , though oddly that was price given both for the phone on its own and for a bundle with a Moto 360 Camera . While we ’ d take all of this information with a pinch of salt , it looks likely that the specs and design shown here are accurate . And as the phone already appears finished and was listed for sale – albeit accidentally – we wouldn ’ t be surprised if it ’ s announced soon . It might not be alone either , as Amazon also had a listing for screen protectors designed specifically for the Moto Z4 Force – another unannounced handset . Via Android Central
Worried that not enough of your home life is being recorded ? Amazon has filed a patent for something called `` pre-wakeword speech processing '' , which could lay the groundwork for an always-on Alexa device that never stops recording . The patent ( via Gizmodo ) was filed on January 24 , and specifies `` a system for capturing and processing portions of a spoken utterance command that may occur before a wakeword '' – which would enable the Alexa voice assistant to act on commands you uttered before calling out Alexa 's name . One of the few things that 's kept user paranoia in check is the existence of the 'wake word ' . You currently need to say the name 'Alexa ' or 'Echo ' in order for your Alexa-enabled speaker to start paying attention to your commands , meaning that you should n't have anything recorded unless you specifically ask for it . The change would mean you could reverse this order , dropping Alexa 's name casually at the end – or even in the middle – of a verbal request . Saying `` Turn down the lights , Alexa '' rather than `` Alexa , turn down the lights '' may not seem like a drastic change in the way you interact with your Amazon Echo . But it could signal a move further into ongoing surveillance by smart speakers that many may not want from their smart speakers . User privacy is an increasingly hot topic , with reports of Amazon employees listening to audio recordings to improve Alexa 's comprehension . This patent , however , also points towards a future where you can interact with Alexa in a more casual , natural way . Whether you think that 's a good thing largely depends on whether you want a voice assistant you 're in control of , or one that feels like a friend . Security researcher David Emm ( Kaspersky Lab ) commented that `` Amazon may argue that analysing stored data will make their devices smarter for Alexa owners – but in today ’ s digital era , such information could be used nefariously , even by trusted parties . `` We are concerned that this latest development shows the company moving in the wrong direction – away from data visibility , privacy , and consent . ”

Would you want your fitness tracker to understand how you 're feeling ? Amazon is reportedly developing a product that can determine human emotions as well as your overall health and fitness . According to internal documents seen by Bloomberg , the company is working with its partner Lab126 - the company that also worked on Amazon 's Echo speaker range - on a device that will use microphones and software to determine your emotional state . These assessments are all driven by your tone of voice , and the company reportedly believes this device may one day be able to offer advice on how the wearer could better interact with people . Work has reportedly been in progress on the project recently , but there 's currently no sign of when it will be released . There 's absolutely no guarantee it will definitely be released either . Amazon carries out extensive product development for a variety of different ideas , not all of which will ultimately be sold . A person familiar with the project has said that a beta project is already under way , with a trial of the software and the product itself going on in the wild . Exactly how the emotion-reading technology will work is currently a mystery , but if it 's something the company is able to achieve with a level of accuracy it may be a game-changing product for Amazon , just like its smart speakers were .

LG has announced that it 's rolling out Amazon Alexa support to its 2019 LG AI ThinQ TVs , which includes its range of LG UHD TVs , NanoCell TVs , and OLED TVs . Amazon 's voice assistant joins Google Assistant , which is already supported by LG TVs , meaning LG customers have more choice when it comes to controlling their TV with their voice . According to LG , the update will be `` implemented through the Alexa app '' , with US customers receiving the update this month . Customers in Europe and Asia can expect the update to roll out `` in the weeks to come '' . Having Alexa built-in to their TVs means that LG customers will be able to `` ask Alexa questions , [ and ] access over 90,000 Alexa skills '' without the need for an external Alexa device like the Amazon Echo . It also means your LG TV could become the center of your smart home , with the ability to control your Alexa-compatible smart gadgets by giving commands to your TV . If you usually start your day by watching a bit of TV , another useful feature of the Alexa-integration is the ability to use Alexa Routines with your TV . These are `` series of actions such as providing traffic information , reporting the weather and listing the day ’ s agenda items '' , which are triggered simply by saying “ Alexa , start my morning . ” Whether you use Alexa , Google Assistant , or a combination of both , contextual knowledge from the LG ThinQ AI assistant will also intelligently weave the assistants together , remembering previous commands so that you can talk in a more natural way to trigger previously or regularly used commands . As well as Alexa integration , LG has announced that LG 2019 OLED and select NanoCell TVs `` will receive AirPlay2 and HomeKit support via a mid-year update '' . This means that if you have a 2019 ThinQ AI TV , you 'll be able to `` watch videos on the Apple TV app and other video apps as well as enjoy photos [ and ] music on compatible LG TV 's connected to an Apple device '' . The introduction of Apple HomeKit means that users will also be able to control these TVs by interacting with Siri or Apple 's Home app , giving customers a range of options when it comes to using AI assistants with their TV . It 's been a big year for LG , with the launch of the world 's first rollable OLED television at CES 2019 , the LG Signature Series OLED TV R .

Amazon ’ s cheapest tablet has just had an upgrade , as the company has announced that it ’ s launching a new version of the Amazon Fire 7 and that it ’ s charging the same price as for the old model , making it just £49.99 ( presumably $ 49.99 but that ’ s to be confirmed ) . The slate packs in twice as much storage as the old model , with 16GB or 32GB built in ( along with a microSD card slot ) , and it has a faster 1.3GHz quad-core chipset . It also gives you hands-free access to Alexa , and has an upgraded 2MP front-facing camera . Most of the rest of the specs and features sound similar to its predecessor . There ’ s a 7-inch screen , a 2MP rear camera , and a number of Amazon-exclusive features , such as X-Ray and Family Library . Interestingly , the battery life is listed as up to 7 hours , which is actually one hour less than the old model . The new Amazon Fire 7 will be available in Black , Twilight Blue , Plum and Sage shades , and is available to pre-order from today ( May 16 ) , with the slate shipping from June 6 . But this isn ’ t the only new tablet from Amazon , as the company has also announced a new version of the Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition . This is also the same price as the old model , at £99.99 ( likely $ 99.99 ) , and it too has a faster chipset than the old model . It additionally has a 7-inch screen , 16GB of storage , a kid-proof case with an adjustable stand , a microSD card slot , and parental controls . It also comes with a one-year subscription to Amazon Fire for Kids Unlimited , which provides access to child-friendly books , videos , apps , games and audiobooks . The new Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition is also available to pre-order from today ( May 16 ) , hits stores on June 6 , and it comes in Blue , Pink and Purple colors .

Amazon has started selling the 1TB version of the Sandisk Extreme , which was announced earlier this year , and means you can potentially load your smartphone or camera with more storage space than your laptop . It is temporarily out of stock , having moved out of preorder earlier today , which indicates that there might be a backlog in orders . At $ 450 ( around £350 , AU $ 650 ) on Sandisk ’ s online shop , it carries a significant premium over smaller capacities . The 128GB version for example retails just over $ 26 ( around £20 , AU $ 40 ) , less than half the per GB price . The card ( known as the SDSQXA1-1T00-GN6MA ) comes with a lifetime warranty and , Sandisk says , is waterproof , shockproof and x-ray proof . With a read speed of up to 90MBps , the Sandisk Extreme is compatible with the new V30 speed class and can record videos at 4K without hitch . Should you want something even faster , then try the Extreme Pro , also in 1TB capacity . It went on sale at Amazon today albeit only in the UK and at a much higher price as well . It almost doubles the read speeds to 170MBps and is fast enough to record in 8K . Micron and Lexar are the other manufacturers that have already announced a 1TB microSD card ; the first one , which we understand , will start selling its card before the end of the month . Other major players that are currently selling 512GB microSD cards include Samsung , Kingston , PNY and Integral . None have confirmed yet when they will offer a 1TB version .
UPDATE : After kicking off last year in the UK and US , Apple Music is now supported on Amazon Echo speakers across Australia and New Zealand , allowing Aussies and Kiwis to stream their songs and playlists to devices such as the Echo Dot , Echo Plus and Echo Show . Original announcement below . Apple and Amazon appear to be playing nice in time for Christmas , with the news that Apple Music has landed on Amazon Echo speakers across the US . The new update started rolling out on December 14 through the Alexa app on Android and iOS , a few days ahead of schedule . Right now the update is only available in the US , with no word yet on when it will become available in other territories . The addition of Apple Music support on Amazon speakers like the Amazon Echo Show , Amazon Echo Dot and other Amazon Echo devices , means that you can now connect your Apple Music account to your Echo via the Alexa app and set it as your default streaming platform . If you ’ re in the US , you can enable the new feature by heading to the Alexa app on your smartphone , opening ‘ Settings ’ , and then linking the Apple Music service to your device . Not all Alexa-enabled speakers will gain support for Apple Music however ; third party speakers like the Sonos One will not be able to use the Alexa skill – saying that , you can always stream via Apple Music using a Bluetooth connection . Now that Apple Music with voice control is no longer exclusive to Apple speakers like the HomePod , it will be interesting to see whether the tech giant experiences a drop off in sales as a result . Still , by making it easier than ever to play music via its flagship streaming platform , Apple could have ensured the longevity of Apple Music , which will benefit the company in the long run .

Alexa now works with over 60,000 smart devices , making it the most widely available voice assistant on the market . According to Digital Trends , this represents a significant increase in availability , as `` just one year ago , Amazon reported that the voice assistant was compatible with 12,000 devices '' . Read more : Anker Soundcore Wakey bedside speaker As Amazon reported that Alexa was compatible with 20,000 products in September 2019 , the company has `` increased the number of products that support Alexa by 200 % '' over the last eight months . In terms of compatibility with smart devices , competing voice assistants like Google Assistant and Apple 's Siri are lagging behind , with Google Assistant supporting `` 10,000 devices from more than 1,000 popular brands as of October 2018 '' . This number could have increased significantly since then if Alexa 's growth is anything to go by – even so , Google has a long way to go if it 's to catch up with Amazon . That margin could increase further still , since Google scrapped its 'Works with Nest ' program following its integration of the home security brand and subsequent launch of the Google Nest Hub Max . According to Engadget , Google 's new privacy initiative will `` allow data sharing between connected devices and apps , but only for a handful of tightly screened partners '' . Despite Alexa 's compatibility with so many devices , Google Assistant and Siri are still the most widely used voice assistants as they come built into smartphones – and smartphones are , of course , far more popular than smart speakers , and probably will be for the foreseeable future .

Apple is notorious for rarely discounting its products , and its true wireless AirPods are no exception – particularly as they 've been given a recent upgrade in the form of the AirPods ( 2019 ) . That 's why we were surprised to see that the Apple earbuds have been given a 10 % discount over at Amazon , bringing the original $ 199.99 price tag down to a slightly more palatable $ 179.99 . Walmart has also price-matched the offer . If you 're outside the US , you can still get a discount – unfortunately the prices in other territories are n't quite as low . In the UK for example , you can get the Apple AirPods ( 2019 ) for £10 cheaper than the £199.99 RRP at Amazon . To take advantage of this deal you need to apply Amazon 's £10 voucher promotion by ticking the box highlighted below : It 's worth noting that these deals are for the AirPods with the wireless charging case ; you can still buy the new AirPods with a standard charging case for less ( $ 159 / £159 ) . Check out the deals below : Apple AirPods ( 2019 ) $ 199.99 $ 179.99 at Amazon ( US ) This is the best deal we 've seen so far for the second-gen Apple Airpods , with $ 20 off the original retail price . Also available for shipping now at Walmart . Image credit : AppleView Deal Apple AirPods ( 2019 ) £199.99 £189.99 at Amazon ( UK ) This is the best deal we 've seen so far for the second-gen Apple Airpods in the UK , with £10 off the original retail price . Image credit : AppleView Deal Amazon Prime Day 2020 is coming up very soon , and you may be wondering whether you should wait until then to buy the Apple AirPods ( 2019 ) – after all , that price could drop even lower . The official Amazon Prime Day deals event kicks off on July 15 and it 's going to last 48 hours , promising to be the biggest Prime Day yet . Whether we will see significantly larger discounts on Apple 's earbuds ( or any other Apple products for that matter ) remains to be seen – but it 's worth bearing in mind that Apple rarely discounts its products by very much . Still , if you do n't need the AirPods right away , there 's no harm in holding out for a fantastic deal on Amazon Prime Day . It 's also worth considering that the next-generation of Apple AirPods , the AirPods 2 , could be right around the corner . We 've heard rumors about noise-canceling and even waterproof earbuds for nearly a year at this point and now some analysts are saying that they 'll arrive by the end of this year or , at the very latest , early on in 2020 . One of the best sources of Apple AirPods 2 rumors comes from a 2018 report from TF International Securities ’ analyst Ming-Chi Kuo . He said that we could be getting two more headphones before 2020 – an updated version of the original Apple AirPods ( check ) and the brand new AirPods 2 . Of course , nobody knows for sure when the official AirPods 2 release date will be . So , if you need some true wireless earbuds sharpish , it 's probably best not to wait for the Apple AirPods 2 – you could be waiting a long time .

During last year 's Amazon Prime Day , the Instant Pot was a top seller during the July shopping event . This year the popular pressure cooker could be an even hotter item thanks to a potential price hike due to China tariffs .

Yes , it 's summer , but Amazon is launching a new way to help you ease back into the next school season with exclusive deals for Prime Student subscribers . Not only are we weeks away from the start of Amazon Prime Day 2020 , but we 're also in the early stages of the back-to-school season . Prime StudentView Deal Yes , even though many students are still in school , back-to-school season usually kicks off mid-to-late June . For that reason , Amazon recently launched an Off to College store with deals on all things dorm- and college-related . Naturally , it helps if you have a Prime Student account . A Prime Student account gives you many of the same perks that a traditional Prime membership includes , but at half the cost . Moreover , students get a free 6-month trial membership instead of just 30 days . After your 6-month trial is up , students just pay $ 59/year for Prime Student . Amazon regularly offers exclusive deals for its Prime Student members . In the past , it 's taken $ 15 off orders of $ 40 or more and even offered its current-gen Echo Dot for as little as $ 5 . So far , the best deal we see in Amazon's Off to College store is 60 % off on Logitech devices . ( This sale is actually available to everyone and not just Prime Student members ) . However , Amazon has teased some upcoming deals for the summer . They include : We expect the hub to offer better deals as the summer progresses and as back-to-school sales take off .
There 's less than a month before Amazon Prime Day on July 15 comes along to convince you to buy all the gadgets and tech you probably do n't need . During last year 's sales , the Amazon website went down for a few hours due to the sheer volume of traffic hitting the site , and it 's likely the company is preparing well in advance for many eager shoppers this year , to avoid the same happening again . Amazon is n't the only company gearing up for Amazon Prime Day though , as eBay has a proposition for you – if Amazon goes down like it did last year , eBay will put on its Crash Sales , so consumers can still get tech products for a discounted price . The eBay Crash Sale will see savings of up to 50 % off products from well-known brands like Samsung , Apple and LG on June 15 – and then if Amazon does crash , eBay will open the doors for even more deals , but they have n't said what so far.. The Crash Sale is one of many sales eBay has coming up to rival Amazon Prime Day : from July 1-7 is the 4th of July 4th Savings , which will see up to 85 % reductions on home electronics like cookware , vacuums and camping gear , and July 8-22 sees Hot Deals for Hot Days , in which each day will bring new deals on tech and gadgets of up to 80 % off . While 50 % off expensive brands might not seem a lot compared to the 80 % and 85 % of the preceding weeks , it 's a lot better than the 0 % savings you 'll see if Amazon goes down with no rivals to take its space , so eBay could be providing a valuable service if this happens . Amazon Prime Day is on July 15 and 16 – so perhaps Prime Days would be a better name – and at TechRadar we 'll be reporting live on all the best deals and bargains , so come back then to find out how to best spend and save your money .

Amazon Student gives college students access to free 2-day shipping and a variety of other Amazon-specific services at half the price of the company 's traditional Prime membership . It also gives students access to exclusive deals on Amazon Prime Day and access to Amazon 's just launched Off-to-College store . It 's handy if you frequently buy from Amazon and use , or are interested in using , its other online services . Even though Amazon raised the annual cost to $ 59 last year ( monthly membership also jumped to $ 6.49 ) , the service is still indispensable . Plus , students get a free six-month trial , which is substantially longer than the 30-day trial standard Prime members receive . Here 's a break down of Amazon Student 's main features . Q. : What is Amazon Prime ? A. : Amazon Prime is an annual subscription program that provides several benefits for members . Subscribers are eligible for free two-day ( and , in some cases , one-day ) shipping on most items and other delivery perks . Members also get unlimited streaming video and music , as well as special offers on other digital media . ( For all of the details on Prime , see our complete Amazon Prime FAQ . ) Prime benefits include the following : Q. : What is Amazon Student ? A. : Amazon Student offers the same benefits as regular Amazon Prime ( $ 99 per year ) , at a discount . It is available to students enrolled in at least one class in a college or university in the United States ( including Puerto Rico as well as online universities ) . A. : Amazon Student costs $ 59 per year or $ 6.49 per month , after a free ( limited ) six-month trial period . Verified students ( you have to have an .edu email address ) are eligible for four years or until graduation — whichever comes first . After that , the membership will auto-renew itself at $ 119 per year . Students must pay tax on the membership if they live in Arizona , California , Florida , Kentucky , Michigan , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Tennessee , Texas , West Virginia or Wisconsin . A. : Amazon Student has a referral program that pays $ 5 to both the student being referred and the student who refers them . Amazon has requirements for how you deliver the invite to a fellow student , by sharing a link on social media or by using Amazon 's email form to send the invite . A. : Amazon Households allows two adults to share membership benefits . So it could be an option for student roommates , but it saves only one extra dollar over Amazon Student . Alternatively , you can opt for the $ 6.49/month plan and cancel it the months you do n't plan to use it . A. : Most items that Amazon sells directly or through `` qualified sellers '' are eligible for free two-day shipping with Amazon Prime . Some of those products are also eligible for free one-day shipping . Oversize items , such as heavy furniture or larger TVs , get free standard shipping . Items sold through third parties ( via Amazon Marketplace ) are ineligible for Prime shipping discounts . A. : You ca n't share your membership with others in your household , as you can with a standard Prime subscription . Though Prime Photos and discounts on new video game releases are included in the six-month free trial period , students do not have access to Amazon 's Prime Music , Prime Instant Video or Kindle Lending Library . A. : You can sign up for a full Prime paid subscription at any time ; you do n't have to wait for the six-month trial to end . A. : You may not need Amazon Prime for the free shipping benefits . Purchases that exceed $ 35 already get free delivery . As far as the additional benefit of streaming services goes , if you are happy with other streaming video or music services you already subscribe to ( such as Hulu , Netflix , Apple Music or Spotify ) , Amazon 's media offerings may not provide you with anything new . ( Check Amazon Prime's video and music listings to see . ) The same is true if you do n't read e-books , or if you use another reader , such as Apple iBooks or Google Play Books . A. : If you do n't have an Amazon account , start by setting one up here . It 's free , but you will have to register a credit card so that Amazon has a way to charge you for purchases . You 'll also have to verify that you are a student . A college-issued email address ending in .edu qualifies you . ( It 's just for receiving a confirmation email from Amazon and does n't have to be the address you use for your Amazon account . ) Otherwise , you 'll have to email Amazon a scan of a document proving you are a student , such as a transcript or a student ID . Amazon.com explains the details . If , during the trial period , you decide that Amazon Student is n't worth paying for , go to your account ( before the trial period ends ) , select Manage Prime Membership and click Do Not Continue . In the meantime , here are some current Student coupons you can take advantage of via membership .

In the ongoing war for your smart home , Samsung ’ s SmartThings brand is releasing a trio of new products that includes a cheaper Amazon Cloud Cam alternative : the lineup of 2019 products consists of the SmartThings Cam ( $ 89.99 ) , SmartThings Wifi Smart Plug ( $ 17.99 ) and SmartThings Smart Bulb ( $ 9.99 ) - all of which go on sale today . While the Samsung SmartThings Smart Bulb seems to be a shot across the bow of smart bulb competitors Sengled , Philips and LIFX , it ’ s the SmartThings Cam and SmartThings Wifi Smart Plug that pose the biggest threat to Amazon . They 're a challenge because not only are Samsung ’ s products cheaper than Amazon ’ s , but also because they ’ re also compatible with both major smart platforms , Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant , plus Samsung ’ s expanding Bixby platform . The good news is that , according to Samsung , you do n't even need a Samsung SmartThings hub for the SmartThings Cam - it works without any additional hardware . Samsung is n't clear if one is required for the Smart Plug and Smart Bulb , but we 'd err on the side of caution and buy one if you plan on investing in Samsung 's burgeoning smart platform . In Amazon 's defense , however , it 's still pretty much the market leader when it comes to smart speakers and smart displays thanks to its Amazon Echo family of devices . That 's an area that Samsung has found real problems breaking into , not the least of which is because of the still-MIA Samsung Galaxy Home smart speaker . Until that comes out , Samsung 's best play into your smart home is its series of QLED TVs that pack in Bixby , or its smart appliances – an area that Amazon has n't really touched outside of its Amazon Basics Alexa Microwave . Are three products going to turn the tide in Samsung 's favor ? Probably not . But , when Samsung finally figures out its Galaxy Home smart speaker , these devices could be the first crucial components in an all-Samsung smart home .
We 're still waiting for Amazon Prime Day to arrive , but you 're in luck if you need to get an affordable processor before then . The Ryzen 5 2600 , one of the best budget processors is 25 % off on Amazon today in the US , meaning you can pick it up for as little as $ 149.99 . This is a 6-core , 12-thread desktop processor with a boost clock of 3.9GHz . What 's better , because all AMD processors are unlocked , you can overclock it to get even more performance – as long as you pick out a compatible motherboard . This is easily one of the best processors for gaming , especially in this price range – you wo n't have any trouble with your CPU bottlenecking your gaming performance . Our advice , though – pair the Ryzen 5 2600 with some speedy RAM to squeeze out some extra performance . At its regular price of $ 199 , the AMD Ryzen 5 2600 is already a steal for how much performance you 're getting . But , at just $ 149 , there 's no reason not to jump on it . AMD Ryzen 5 3600 | $ 199 $ 149 at Amazon The AMD Ryzen 5 2600 is without a doubt one of the best budget processors . And , thanks to this Amazon deal , you can score 25 % off , netting 6-cores and 12-threads for just $ 149 . View Deal

Amazon has unveiled a new Amazon Fire 4K TV set ahead of Amazon Prime Day 2020 , and it has Dolby Vision , Alexa and an HD antenna for local channels all baked in to the TV . The Amazon Fire TV Edition with Dolby Vision , as it ’ s officially called , pairs a big-screen television with a slick Fire TV interface backed by Alexa voice commands , and marks the first time we 've seen Dolby Vision on an Amazon Fire TV Edition screen . We say 'first TV ' because this isn ’ t the first Dolby Vision product from Amazon – the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K already supports Dolby 's dynamic metadata HDR standard , which uses dynamic metadata for better contrast and color saturation . But the perk here is that it ’ s built in , so you do n't have to plug in another Fire TV device , and you can use Alexa commands to move about the UI hands-free . Like previous Amazon Fire TV Edition TVs these are US-only , for the time being at least . The 55-inch is shipping now , while a smaller 50-inch ( pictured ) and even smaller 43-inch versions will come to Best Buy at a later date . The Amazon Fire TV Edition price is listed at : 55-inch : $ 449.99 50-inch : $ 379.99 43-inch : $ 329.99 While Dolby Vision is the big draw here , the Amazon Fire TV Edition also integrates the power of the Fire TV Recast , which pairs a DVR with an HD antenna . Amazon staff told TechRadar that they were able to pull down 100 local channels in New York . To date , Amazon has partnered with Insignia and Toshiba to release over 20 Amazon Fire TV Edition screens , although these are the first to support Dolby Vision . What makes this all the more interesting is that Amazon has a large library of HDR10+ content , a rival to Dolby Vision , and was seen as a leader in that category . It 's not yet clear how this new batch of TVs will affect Amazon 's plan to support more of that content in the future .
If you 're looking into getting a home security camera , you may well be looking at products from Blink or Ring . Both brands are owned by Amazon , but they bring very different capabilities and price points to the party . Blink offers affordable security cameras for in and around the home . It ’ s a scalable , entry-level system that ’ s designed to be easy to fit and use . For a relatively low price , you can set up motion-sensing cameras and have alerts send to your smartphone . There ’ s no monthly fee , and the cameras use regular batteries . Ring is best known for its video doorbells , but the security firm has expanded to offer a range of complementary security cameras . Prices are higher than for Blink products , and you ’ ll need to subscribe to one of Ring 's Protect plans if you want to store recorded footage , but the hardware is more versatile and offers several potentially important extra features . While Amazon owns both companies , Blink and Ring are quite different prospects . Both are worth considering if you ’ re looking to set up security cameras in and/or outside your home , but it 's likely that one system will suit you better than the other – so let ’ s dig into what each offers – and with Amazon Prime Day just around the corner you can expect to see cut-price deals on most of the products featured here . For a single indoor camera from Blink you ’ ll pay £79.99 / $ 79.99 ( about AU $ 145 ) , but you can add additional cameras for £69.99 / $ 69.99 ( roughly AU $ 125 ) each . You also have the option to buy a five-camera system for £289.99 / $ 279.99 ( about AU $ 525 ) . The Blink XT , which is the outdoor weatherproof camera , will cost you £99.99 ( approximately AU $ 180 ) for a single camera system , with additional cameras at £89.99 ( around AU $ 165 ) each , though you can get a five-camera system for £399.99 ( roughly AU $ 725 ) . If you 're in the US , the outdoor model is the Blink XT2 rather than the XT . This costs $ 99.99 for one , then $ 89.99 for additional cameras , or you can pay $ 379.99 for a five-camera system . This promises improved motion detection , two-way audio , and longer battery life over the original Blink XT , but is otherwise similar . It should be landing in the UK some time in 2019 . Blink systems come with a wireless hub , called a Blink Sync Module , that can support up to 10 cameras . There are no monthly fees . Ring offers video doorbells . The original Video Doorbell is £89 / $ 99.99 / AU $ 149 and the Video Doorbell 2 is £149 / $ 159 / AU $ 329 . You can also get a variety of security cameras from Ring . The basic Stick Up Cam can be placed indoors or out and costs £139 / $ 149.99 / AU $ 319 for the wired or battery-operated version . You can also get a solar version , powered by its own solar panel for £179 / $ 229 / AU $ 399 . There ’ s also a Spotlight Cam at £169 / $ 169 / AU $ 329 for the wired or battery model , and £199 / $ 229 / AU $ 359 for the solar version . Finally , there ’ s a Floodlight Cam at £199 / $ 199 / AU $ 379 , which is designed to be wired in . It ’ s not essential to subscribe to a Ring plan unless you want to be able to record video – without a plan your Ring cameras will just work as live feed devices . The Protect Basic or Protect Plus plans store recorded video in the cloud for 30 days . A Protect Basic Plan is £2.50 / $ 3 / AU $ 4 per month or £24.99 / $ 30 / AU $ 40 per year , but only covers one device . A Protect Plus Plan costs £8 / $ 10 / AU $ 15 per month or £80 / $ 100 / AU $ 150 per year , and covers every Ring device at one address . Blink is a more basic system offering two types of camera that need to be hooked up wirelessly to a Sync Module over Wi-Fi . Ring offers a variety of standalone devices that connect directly to your Wi-Fi network . The indoor Blink camera has motion and temperature sensors and a microphone . It can record HD video at 720p and takes two standard AA lithium batteries . The slightly more expensive Blink XT or XT2 camera is suitable for the outdoors as it has an IP65 rating . It can also record at higher quality , up to 1080p , and it has infrared night vision . Blink suggests the batteries will last up to two years , but much depends on how often your camera is triggered – in practice , the Blink XT2 should easily be able to hit the two-year mark . Ring ’ s system is far more versatile . All three of the security cameras record 1080p footage , just like the Ring Video Doorbell 2 . You can choose rechargeable battery power , wire them in , or opt for the solar panel with the Stick Up Cam or Spotlight Cam . The Stick Up Cam can be used indoors or out and it offers two-way talk , which is lacking in all Blink systems except the Blink XT2 . The Spotlight Cam is designed for outside , and adds LED light strips and a siren . Ring also offers the Floodlight Cam , which is designed to replace security lights . It lights up when it senses motion , streams video and sends you a notification . It also includes a 110-decibel siren to help you scare off suspicious people . The Floodlight Cam must be hardwired to a standard electrical box . In the US and Canada , Ring even offers a full Ring Alarm security kit , which bundles together motion sensors and a keypad , and also integrates with other Ring products . You can use Amazon ’ s Alexa voice assistant with both Blink and Ring devices . You can also set up motion events to trigger other smart home devices , so that , for example , your porch lights turn on when motion is detected at the door . If you have an Amazon Echo you can even use it to communicate through your Ring cameras and have a two-way conversation . The Ring app also works with various smart lock systems . The Blink Home Monitor app is free for Android or iOS . It enables you to customize your camera settings , determine the sensitivity of the motion sensor , choose the length of video clips it records , and set up a schedule if you want . The app records video in five second bursts by default , but you can increase that up to 60 seconds . You ’ ll get alerts on your phone when motion is detected by your Blink cameras , and you can then review the recorded clips . You can also choose to tune in to the live feed , but you can ’ t record video when watching a camera live . You ’ ll also be asked if you ’ re still watching every 60 seconds . The free storage space is enough for 7,200 seconds of video in total and it will overwrite the oldest video clips as soon as the limit is reached . If you 're using the Blink XT2 , you can also use two-way audio through the app . The Ring app is also free for Android and iOS . It will alert you when motion is detected , or when the doorbell rings if you opt for a doorbell . You can view a live feed of the camera and , if you ’ re using a doorbell , Stick Up , or Spotlight Cam , even have a two-way conversation with whoever is there . You can also adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensors to reduce the risk of false positives . You could install either the Blink or Ring systems yourself , unless you opt for the wired-in Ring devices . If you ’ re looking to keep costs down and just want a basic system with no hidden fees or subscription , then Blink could be exactly what you need . The Ring devices are more expensive to begin with , and you ’ ll need a monthly subscription to record and review video . Ring offers a much more versatile set of devices and power options , with extra features such as light and siren functionality . There are also cameras with two-way audio , and while Blink offers this too , it 's only on the Blink XT2 , which is currently only available in the US and Canada .

Having released a kids-friendly version of the Echo Dot last year , Amazon has given the popular smart speaker a fresh new look and a louder sound for 2019 . The new Echo Dot Kids Edition 2019 comes with child-friendly perks , including a two-year damage replacement warranty , a cute rainbow design , and a year 's subscription to the FreeTime Unlimited kid-focused service . Enabled by Alexa , FreeTime Unlimited gives parents peace of mind that the content their children are accessing is age-appropriate – for example , kids are able to listen to `` over 1,000 appropriate Audible audiobooks '' , as well as `` play music , hear stories , call approved friends and family , and explore a world of kid-friendly skills '' , according to Amazon . After the year 's free subscription , FreeTime costs $ 2.99 per month `` plus applicable tax '' . The subscription renews automatically every month , but you can `` cancel any time by visiting the Amazon Parent Dashboard or contacting Customer Service '' . The Echo Dot Kids Edition 2019 itself costs $ 69.99 – however , Amazon currently have an introductory price of $ 49.99 . Even with the discount , that 's still $ 20 more expensive than the regular third-generation Echo Dot . So , what 's new with this year 's kid-friendly mini smart speaker ? Well , it now comes with a jaunty rainbow-stripe patterned grille , as well as coming in a more sedate blue color scheme that will probably appeal to older kids . According to Amazon , the upgraded Dot is 70 % louder than the previous model – so it might be a good idea to invest in some good quality earplugs . Unless you like the sound of your kids ' music blaring out at all hours , of course . Via Engadget

Tech giants often work alongside the government to help with a variety of projects and the head of Amazon 's cloud computing division has revealed that the company is open to working with any government agency that follows the law . This is in stark contrast to its top rivals , Microsoft and Google , who have turned down government projects over ethical concerns . At the 2019 Code Conference , AWS CEO Andy Jassy responded to a question regarding the company 's work with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement , saying : “ We will serve the federal government , and they will have to use the technology responsibly . Any government department that ’ s following the law , we will serve them . ” At the same time though , Jassy hopes that federal regulators will hurry up or else we could soon have “ 50 different laws in 50 different states ” . Amazon has become entangled in a public debate over the use of facial recognition technology by governments over the past year with critics warning of false matches and arrests while proponents believe the technology would help keep the public safe . Jassy acknowledged that the issues surrounding facial recognition technology are indeed very real but said that “ just because technology could be misused , does n't mean you should ban or condemn it ” . Amazon 's face and image ID service called Rekognition has been used by law enforcement in Oregon and Florida and many are concerned that it will soon be deployed in other US states . Microsoft on the other hand , has taken a different approach than Amazon and the company has defended its $ 480m hardware contract with the US Army while holding off on selling its facial recognition technology when it believed that human rights would be at risk .

Amazon has announced the Amazon Echo Show 5 , the latest addition to the Echo family . Confusingly , this is n't the fifth generation of Amazon 's popular Alexa-powered Echo Show smart display – it 's actually the third generation , with its name referring to its diminutive 5.5-inch screen . Amazon says that the new smart display is available to pre-order now , and will start shipping in the US , United Kingdom , Germany , France , Italy , Spain , Japan , Canada , New Zealand , and Australia in June , and in India in July . It will cost $ 89.99 / £79.99 / AU $ 129 , which is far more affordable than the current Echo Show , which costs $ 229 / £219.99 / AU $ 349 . If you preorder two Echo Show 5s from Amazon , you can get a $ 30 / £25 discount in the US and the UK respectively . Unfortunately the same deal does n't seem to be available in Australia . At just over half the size of its predecessor , the compact new smart display is designed to fit comfortably in tight spaces , as Tom Taylor , Senior Vice President , Amazon Alexa explains : “ The compact form factor is perfect for a bedside table or desk , plus it has a camera shutter for added peace of mind , and new Alexa privacy features for even more control . ” For those concerned about privacy , the inclusion of a physical shutter on the Echo Show 5 's HD camera should offer some reassurance that Alexa wo n't spy on you from your bedside table . As well as that , Amazon says the new Echo Show 5 includes a `` microphone/camera off button that electronically disconnects both the microphone and camera , and a clear visual indicator that shows when audio or video is streaming to the cloud '' . Amazon is also introducing easy ways to delete your voice recordings on all Alexa-enabled devices . From now on , you can simply say , “ Alexa , delete everything I said today ” and the respective recordings will be deleted . Amazon says that customers will also soon be able to `` delete their last request by saying “ Alexa , delete what I just said ” . The company 's emphasis on privacy is likely in response to reports that Amazon employees could be listening to recorded Alexa conversations . According to Amazon , the Echo Show 5 's small form factor does n't mean it packs less of an audiovisual punch than its larger predecessor , which impressed us with its big , bright , responsive touch screen . Depending on where you are in the world , you can currently access TV and video through the Echo Show from the likes of Prime Video , NBC , BBC iPlayer , YouTube , and more – some of these are available via Alexa skills , while others like YouTube will need to be accessed via the Show 's browser . Amazon is also introducing a new integration with wikiHow that `` allows you to access hundreds of how-to videos by voice '' , so you can just ask Alexa to `` show you how to open a tight jar , clean a cast iron skillet , make a paper crane , or solve a Rubik ’ s Cube '' . While it 's not in use , you can display clock faces or your own photo on the home screen . If most of your photos are on Facebook you can also link it up to you account to play a slideshow of your photos . It should sound great too , if it delivers the `` rich and full sound '' Amazon promises , whether you 're watching music videos on Vevo , or playing songs on Amazon Music , Spotify , Apple Music , or Pandora . Hopefully Amazon has addressed the bass-heavy presentation we found in the previous Echo Show , which we found a little off-putting when it came to spoken word content like podcasts or radio shows . Amazon has also announced a new smart home dashboard that 's available on `` all Echo Show devices '' , which is designed to give more control over your smart home gadgets . Now , as well as giving Alexa voice commands , you can do things like turning your lights off by using on-screen controls . Amazon says you can also `` view your smart home camera feed and thermostats , access recently used devices , and manage smart devices by group . '' As ever with Amazon Echo products , if you choose to share your contacts book with Alexa , you can use the Echo Show 5 to place calls to mobiles and landlines – a feature which will have rolled out for UK users as well as US Echo owners by the time the Echo Show 5 hits store shelves . Like previous Echo Show devices , the Echo Show 5 is compatible with a range of smart home gadgets including the Arlo baby camera and Ring doorbell cameras . Amazon seems to be pushing the idea that consumers would have multiple Echo devices in the home rather than opting for just one , saying that , `` with Echo Show 5 in multiple rooms of your home , you can easily drop in on another room or make an announcement that dinner is ready . '' Whether consumers are likely to spend $ 90 on every room , kitting each one out with an Echo Show 5 remains to be seen , but it could be a useful addition if you want to bring Alexa to rooms that are tight on space .

It ’ s almost Amazon Prime Day , and one of the best discounts is on the company ’ s own Kindles . But which will you choose ? If you ’ re after the more luxe models , the Kindle Oasis ( 2nd generation ) might be your best pick . But what about the now-retired Kindle Voyage – is it worth hunting one of them down ? Let ’ s dive in to the differences between both upscale ereaders . Form factor is the most obvious difference between these two pricey ereaders . The Kindle Voyage has a traditional centered screen with a button on each side , while the Kindle Oasis has a deliberately offset screen with two buttons on one side only – which is notably thicker to better hold one-handed . The Kindle Voyage has wide bezels but a flush screen , with soft buttons that buzz with haptics when you press them rather than simply click inwards . It has a rubber cover around the angled back , and the cover curves around the edges of the plastic front . The Oasis , on the other hand , has a metal frame for an extra degree of luxe , but it ’ s slightly ( about 14g , to be specific ) heavier than the Voyage . As previously stated , one side is thicker than the other to give a bit of a one-handed grip – and unlike the Voyage , the Oasis is IPX8 water resistant up to 2 meters or dunked for 60 minutes , which is a relief for poolside or bathtime reading . The Kindle Voyage was definitely meant to be premium . Its 6-inch , 300dpi screen shows sharp words , with a 6-LED backlight that uniformly lit the screen more than previous less pricey Kindles . The ambient lighting brightens or darkens the screen according to outside conditions , with ‘ micro-etching ’ across the screen for a more paper-like look . The Kindle Oasis has a larger 7-inch display at the same 300dpi resolution as most Kindles . It has 12 LEDs backlighting its screen , double those in the Voyage . Storage size is another area where these ereaders differ . The Voyage comes with 4GB of storage , as befits a device released in 2014 , while the newer Oasis comes in either 8GB or 32GB . The Oasis does have another particular perk – it can play audio , which could be music but is ideally reserved for audiobooks . There ’ s no speakers or even a headphone jack , sadly , but you can connect via Bluetooth and listen that way . If you happen to buy the Audible companion to a book , you can switch between text and audio versions while keeping your place . The Kindle Oasis starts at a hefty $ 249/£229 for the 8GB , WiFi-only version , or you can bump that up to 32GB for $ 279/£259 . If you want online connectivity , the 32GB WiFi + cellular version costs $ 349/£319 . ( None seem to be currently available in Australia . ) As previously mentioned , Amazon retired the Kindle Voyage in August 2018 ( per TechTimes ) . You can still pick one up secondhand , like this listing on eBay for $ 159 , which is a discount off the $ 199/£169/AU $ 250 launch price for the basic WiFi-only model . In many ways , there is no competition : the Kindle Oasis is so much easier to find that it ’ s almost criminal to vouch for the discontinued Voyage . But the former was even more expensive from the jump , and it would be harder to justify picking up the much pricier Oasis when the Voyage offered nearly as luxe an experience for less . That aside , the Oasis does have the advantage in feel and storage , allowing you to filter in your audiobooks and download them with a cellular connection . If price isn ’ t an issue , the Oasis is the superior ereader .

It ’ s almost Amazon Prime Day , and that ’ s sure to be the ideal time to pick up a Kindle , as prices are likely to be heavily reduced . But which one to choose ? If you ’ re not after an all-out deluxe flagship of an ereader then really it comes down to either the Amazon Kindle or the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite . These two reading machines have plenty in common , but there are a number of key differences as well . We ’ ve highlighted these below , so you can make the right reading choice . When it comes to the design of these two devices there isn ’ t a huge amount of difference . In fact , the most obvious difference is potentially just the color , as while both ereaders come in black , the basic Amazon Kindle is also available in white , whereas the Kindle Paperwhite doesn ’ t give you any color choice . Otherwise , the look is similar , with both sporting a fairly plain plastic body and large bezels around the screen . In the Kindle Paperwhite ’ s case though those bezels are flush with the screen , whereas they ’ re raised on the basic Kindle . This leads to the Paperwhite looking and feeling slightly higher end . Dimensions and weight also differ between the two , with the Amazon Kindle coming in at 160 x 113 x 8.7mm and 174g , while the Kindle Paperwhite is 167 x 116 x 8.2mm and 182g ( or 191g if you opt for a version with cellular connectivity ) . So the Paperwhite is slightly taller and wider but not as thick . The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite also comes with water resistance . It ’ s IPX8 rated , meaning it can survive being submerged up to 2 meters deep in fresh water for up to 60 minutes . So you can safely read on the beach or in the bath . The basic Kindle comes with no such reassurances . Both the Amazon Kindle and the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite have a 6-inch display , and in both cases it ’ s designed to be glare-free . The main difference is how sharp it is , as while the basic Kindle ’ s screen is 167 pixels per inch , the Paperwhite is 300 pixels per inch , so text looks crisper and closer to how it would appear printed on paper . The difference is most noticeable when reading comics and the like though . If you ’ re just looking at text the higher resolution won ’ t usually make a big difference . Both screens also have a front light , so you can read in the dark without needing an external light source , but the Paperwhite ’ s can get brighter , as it uses 5 LEDs , while the basic Amazon Kindle uses 4 . There are two main differences in the specs of these ereaders . The first is that the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite comes with far more storage , as you can get it with 8GB or 32GB , while the basic Amazon Kindle only comes with 4GB . This needn ’ t be a major problem , since ebook files are usually tiny and if you ’ re buying from Amazon they can be stored in the cloud when you ’ re not actively reading them anyway . However , the storage space becomes more of a concern if you plan to listen to audiobooks through Audible . That ’ s a feature both ereaders support , but it ’ s far more viable on the Paperwhite . The other major difference is that as well as Wi-Fi you can get the Kindle Paperwhite in a Wi-Fi and cellular flavor ( with free 3G and 4G connectivity ) , whereas the basic Kindle only supports Wi-Fi . For most people this again shouldn ’ t be a big deal , but cellular data does mean you can buy and download books any time , anywhere , whereas you ’ re a bit more limited with just Wi-Fi . Most other things are similar or the same , including their software and battery life . The Amazon Kindle starts at £69.99 / $ 89.99 , but that ’ s a version with adverts on the lock screen . If you ’ d rather not have adverts you ’ ll have to pay £79.99 / $ 109.99 . In Australia you can only get a version without adverts , which costs AU $ 139 . The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite on the other hand starts at £119.99 / $ 129.99 for the 8GB Wi-Fi version with adverts , but there are more options here . For £129.99 / $ 149.99 / AU $ 199 you can get the same version without adverts , while for £149.99 / $ 159.99 you can get a 32GB Wi-Fi model with adverts , and for £159.99 / $ 179.99 / AU $ 249 you can get that one without them . As before , Australia only has the ad-free versions . At the top end there ’ s a 32GB cellular version for £219.99 / $ 249.99 / AU $ 369 - there ’ s no option to get this one with adverts . So the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is substantially more expensive , starting at close to twice the basic Kindle ’ s price . All that said , prices are sure to drop on Amazon Prime Day , so keep an eye out for Kindle deals . The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is quite a lot more expensive than the basic Amazon Kindle , but it ’ s still reasonably affordable and comfortably undercuts the likes of the Kindle Oasis . The extra money that you ’ d have to spend for the Paperwhite gets you a sharper screen , more storage , a slightly higher-end design , water resistance , a better front light , and potentially cellular connectivity . Whether those things are worth it will largely depend on when , where , what and how much you plan to read .

Amazon retained its top spot as the number one vendor in the infrastructure as a service ( IaaS ) market in 2018 according to the latest figures from Gartner . Last year the IaaS market grew by 31.3 percent to reach $ 32.4bn with Amazon taking the lead followed by Microsoft , Alibaba , Google and IBM . Research vice president at Gartner , Sid Nag explained why tech giants like Amazon continue to dominate the IaaS market , saying : `` Despite strong growth across the board , the cloud market ’ s consolidation favours the large and dominant providers , with smaller and niche providers losing share . This is an indication that scalability matters when it comes to the public cloud IaaS business . Only those providers who invest capital expenditure in building out data centres at scale across multiple regions will succeed and continue to capture market share . Offering rich feature functionality across the cloud technology stack will be the ticket to success , as well . ” The top five IaaS providers accounted for almost 77 percent of the global IaaS market in 2018 , up from less than 73 percent in 2017 . Gartner expects that market consolidation will continue through 2019 as a result of the high rate of growth for the top providers which experienced aggregate growth of 39 percent from 2017 to 2018 compared with the more modest growth of 11 percent for all other providers during the same period . Amazon continued to lead the global IaaS market with an estimated $ 15.5bn in revenue during 2018 . In addition to being the largest of the IaaS providers , the company accounts for nearly half of the total IaaS market . Microsoft managed to secure the number two position in the IaaS market with revenue surpassing $ 5bn in 2018 , up from $ 3.1bn in 2017 . Among the leading vendors , Alibaba Cloud was the dominant IaaS provider in China and the firm grew by 92.6 percent in 2018 . Google earned the number four spot as it grew its revenue by 60.2 percent from 2017 .

Have you ever wished you could jump right into your favorite streaming platform and navigate all your shows and contents in a virtual world ? Well now you can – if you have an Oculus VR headset , you can now stream shows and movies from Amazon Prime Video via a new Prime Video VR app , which lets you watch in the comfort of a virtual theatre . The app allows US and UK owners of the Oculus Quest , Oculus Go , Oculus Rift , and Gear VR to watch Prime Video shows like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and Good Omens on their headsets – all searchable by voice . Amazon has also announced that users will be able to immerse themselves in 360-degree videos – although , for the moment , there are only 10 titles to choose from , and you 'll need to be a Prime member to access them . According to an Oculus press release , these include '' Emmy-nominated short film INVASION ! `` , and Greenland Melting , an `` immersive documentary from NOVA and Frontline that explores the effects of climate change on the Arctic island of Greenland '' . If you 're not enamored by the content on offer at Prime Video , there are a few different streaming platforms you can access with your Oculus headset . There 's Oculus VR , the official video app from the company , as well as YouTube VR , Facebook Watch , and streaming giant Netflix . Whether upcoming streaming platforms like Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus will also launch VR-friendly apps remains to be seen , but if they want to keep up with the competition they 'll need to look into offering immersive content for those who want to truly lose themselves in their favorite film or TV show .

Remember libraries - those big buildings filled with books ? If you ’ re anything like us , you haven ’ t been in one since university . That said , digital libraries are very much alive , with services like Rakuten Overdrive , Borrowbox or RB Digital renting out eBooks to online library members across the US and UK . If you want more flexibility with your renting than a service tied to a national library , and want to read borrowed books on your Kindle , or the excellent Kindle App , Amazon ’ s answer is called Kindle Unlimited . With over a million ebooks to choose from , accessible across Kindles , smartphones , tablets and computers , it ’ s a great way for bookworms to get access to loads of literature . The service also offers up some audiobooks too , with the monthly subscription fee giving you scope to store 10 offline titles at any given time . Unlike libraries , there ’ s no ‘ due by ’ date , so no late fees , just leisurely reading until you ’ re ready to swap out your downloaded titles for more ; think of it as the Netflix we ’ d want our kids to be hooked on . Also unlike libraries , however , there is a subscription fee to be paid . Read on to find out if it 's worth your money . Amazon ’ s Kindle Unlimited service works directly within the Kindle app , which can be downloaded to pretty much any device with an internet connection . The big players include iOS and Android phones and tablets , Fire tablets and Windows or Mac devices , all through their respective stores . Naturally , Kindle Unlimited books can also be read on Kindles - Amazon ’ s excellent eReaders , which range from affordable budget eInk displays to premium backlit slabs like the Kindle Oasis . That said , other manufacturer ’ s eReaders , such as Kobo Clara or Forma won ’ t support the service . Alternatively , if you want access to your books at work or at a friend ’ s computer , you can also log into your Kindle account and fire up your Unlimited library through a web browser like Chrome , Edge , FireFox or Safari . Our preferred usage ? Discovering books using the web browser , and reading them on-the-go . Kindle Unlimited costs $ 9.99/£7.99 per month , which equates to $ 119.88/£95.88 a year , so depending on how many books and magazines you buy , it could be a great way to streamline your costs , provided your chosen titles are available on the service . You can sign up for a trial which should give you a flavor as to how much of the content you want is available . You can rent ten titles at any given time with your Kindle Unlimited subscription . This covers books and magazines , so you can mix and match until your library is full . If your library is at capacity , when you come to rent an 11th title , the service prompts you to either buy it or remove another Kindle Unlimited title from your account . Kindle Unlimited definitely isn ’ t just a book service , with glossy magazines and audiobooks available to download too . Certain magazines can be rented as standalone issues , while others can be subscribed to and delivered to your Kindle device or app as new issues are released . Many titles like National Geographic are optimised for the display they ’ re being viewed on , reflowing the text to display perfectly , and resizing images . This means whether you ’ re reading on a long smartphone or a wide tablet , the experience should be easy on the eye . Others , however , don ’ t , so will leave you having to deal with a fair bit of pinching and zooming if on a smaller display . Audiobooks are a bit harder to pin down than magazines and work with Kindle Unlimited in two ways . The reliable way is through WhisperSync , with Audible downloads that you ’ ve purchased syncing with Kindle Unlimited books . This means that you can pick up where you left off when you ’ re juggling a single book across eBook and audiobook formats . The service also includes over 2,000 free Audible audiobooks , which can be listened to through the Kindle app or the Audible app according to the website , apparently . That said , in our experience , the service constantly suggested we buy the audiobooks included with the Unlimited package , and we weren ’ t actually able to make a single ‘ Audible narration included ’ book playback for free . If you ’ re worried about messing up your library with loads of Kindle Unlimited books , don ’ t be . All your old books remain in-tact and are just supplemented by your rented books and magazines until either you ‘ return them ’ , or cancel your Unlimited account , which can be done at any time . If you like the idea of Amazon ’ s Kindle Unlimited , but want to shop around , then the main competition comes from Scribd . Offering a one-month free trial , Scribd costs $ 8.99 ( about £7.25 ) per month , and even gives you a free access to Blinkist , Pocket and Mubi at no extra cost , so long as your Scribd subscription is active . The main drawback of Scribd is that it isn ’ t available on Kindles . If however , you plan on reading content on your phone or tablet primarily , it ’ s a great alternative with easy to find audiobooks ( that work ) . One point to note , unlike Kindle , which is a global service with great localisation , Scribd is a US-centric offering , so magazines , in particular , are the US versions . While the audiobook offering isn ’ t perfect , one thing the Kindle Unlimited experience does better than the rest is display eBooks . It offers extensive customisations to the look and feel of your eBook , right through to a feature called Word Runner , which helps wannabe speed readers whizz through titles by displaying single words at a time at a set pace . With all the services mentioned offering free trials , and Kindle Unlimited giving you a 3-month grace period to figure out if the service is right for you , if you ’ re addicted to reading and have an Amazon account , it ’ s definitely worth checking out .

Following the feeding frenzy of Amazon Prime Day , Google has debuted its new shopping platform to lure customers with personalized recommendations . The tool is now live in the US , and will welcome you by name and show tailored suggestions if you 're logged in with your Google account . Google has previously insisted that it has no intention of becoming a retailer , but the new shopping portal puts it in clear competition with Amazon . Google is n't about to start building warehouses to stock products though , and will instead point shoppers in the direction of a handful of selected retailers including Costco and Target . Search for an item , and the new site will point you towards products for sale in Google 's own store ( for devices like Google Home speakers ) , or from its chosen third-party sellers . According to Forbes , it may also point you in the direction of a physical bricks-and-mortar store . Some products will be sold with a 'Buy with Google Guarantee ' , which promises a refund for shoppers if the recommended retailer fails to deliver on time . Google has already tested the shopping platform in a few territories , including France , but has now rolled it out officially in its biggest potential market , the US . While it has n't launched outside of the US at the moment , the fact that it tested the platform in France suggests that Google has global ambitions . Although Amazon has become a literal one-stop shop for virtually every product imaginable , Google has the advantage of having shoppers ' entire search history at its fingertips . It remains to be seen whether this will be enough to allow it to carve its own niche , or if it will end up like its ill-fated attempt to take on Facebook with Google+ .

Update : This Apple AirPods deals is still available ( no it did n't sell out like some sites were predicting ) , however , it is a bit backordered until next week . However , the actual AirPods deal is still in place , so you 'll save money in any event . Confession : I bought the Apple AirPods 2019 on Amazon Prime Day , even though I technically do n't need them . After all , I have the original AirPods from late 2017 . There are several reasons I made the purchase , after much pondering . Sure , it has new features like touchless 'Hey Siri ' and wireless charging . But the perks that swayed me to upgrade are all minor in comparison . Here are the three reasons I bought new AirPods , and how much I paid for them during Prime Day 2019 . I 've been waiting for Amazon Prime Day 2019 to roll around to buy a lot of things . I mean I 've been rationing supplies like trash bags , laundry detergent , and even heavy duty sponges – all on sale and finally bought today . I need new sunglasses , but I did n't get them until today either . I 've saved $ 50 on supplies in the end . This same purposeful procrastination applied to the AirPods 2 with wireless charging . I did n't need them right away , so paying $ 30 less for the version with wireless charging 16 weeks after they first launched made a lot of sense to me . Here 's how much they cost on sale in the US and UK… US : Apple AirPods ( 2019 ) with wireless charging case $ 199 $ 169.99 on Amazon Yes , the wireless charging case makes these AirPods pricier , but I was able to save a cool $ 30 with this Prime Day-timed discount.View Deal Note in the US : I saved an extra $ 9.01 by choosing No-Rush Shipping option . Amazon may be doing this for two reasons : AirPods are going to be very popular today , and everyone from Amazon employees and UPS drivers are going to overloaded shipping everything else sold over the course of the next two days . It gives them a reprieve from getting a popular item out to you . To Amazon , that must be worth $ 9.01 .

That 's the best price we 've found for the truly wireless earbuds , which come with a charging case . View Deal UK Amazon : Apple AirPods ( 2019 ) with Charging Case £159 £154.20 at Amazon In the UK , things are a little quieter in terms of Airpods deals – this is the best you 're going to get at the moment – £5 off the usual price at Amazon . View Deal If I 'm going to sell my AirPods , it has to be in 2019 for them to be worth anything . In time , the battery life will fail and audio volume will diminish . It 's good enough for someone else to enjoy for another year or two ( probably a family member since I would n't want to overcharge a stranger for something that has finite life ) . I 'm a big believer in getting rid of old tech to fund the purchase of new gadgets . It 's how I funded the purchase of the iPhone XS Max , Apple Watch 3 and MacBook Pro . Advice : Get rid of things while they still have value attached to them . My current AirPods from 2017 still last roughly four hours between charges , which is still impressive , in my opinion . It 's longer than other people I 've talked to are getting – several have told me about battery life issues . Having a refreshed battery life that goes a full five hours between charges will give me exactly what I need on longer cross-country flights – and someone in my family will find four hours and , eventually , even three hours , just fine for their purposes .
The growing success of podcasts has led major players in the tech industry to finally start considering them as a serious source of revenue , with big brands increasingly offering funding and support to existing producers and original creators . A new report from Bloomberg suggests that Apple intends to fund its own original podcasts and stream them exclusively on its own platform , according to “ people familiar with the matter ” , in order to compete with the existing market . The report claims that podcasting companies have been approached by Apple executives offering to buy exclusive rights to their series ’ , although the Cupertino firm ’ s plan isn ’ t fully laid out in these communications . Earlier in 2019 , music-streaming giant Spotify spent over $ 200 million to acquire two successful podcasting companies – including Gimlet Media – in the hope to become “ both the premier producer of podcasts and the leading platform for podcast creators ” . Recently , Apple discontinued its long-running iTunes music platform in favor of splitting it up into Apple Music , Apple TV , and Apple Podcasts , signalling a more focused approach to each category . Despite being predominantly responsible for the initial popularity of the category in 2005 , when the company officially added the ability to subscribe to podcasts in the iTunes app , Apple hasn ’ t altered its strategy around the free audio format in any significant way over the past 14 years . Now , more than a quarter of Americans listen to podcasts at least once a month , and even if they currently use Apple 's Podcasts app , none of that audience pays anything to the company – or even encounters any advertising from the tech giant . While there ’ s currently no official word from Apple on its exact plan for exclusive podcasts – or even if there is one – it seems like a sensible move for a company that has , perhaps unwittingly , found itself with a large amount of influence over the format .

Windows 10 has a new preview build of the update that 's due to land in the latter half of 2019 , and while it only comes with a few changes ( unsurprisingly ) , one is pretty interesting , with Microsoft giving digital assistants like Amazon ’ s Alexa a promotion to the lock screen of the OS . In other words , for Windows 10 19H2 preview build 18362.10005 , which has just been released to the slow ring , third-party digital assistants can be voice activated direct from the Windows 10 lock screen . Previously , if the operating system was locked , the only digital assistant you could get the attention of was Microsoft ’ s own built-in Cortana . With this change , the likes of Alexa can now be activated from the lock screen . We mention Alexa specifically because Microsoft has already brought Amazon ’ s digital assistant to some Windows 10 laptops and PCs , with deeper integration between Cortana and Alexa . And back at the start of 2019 , we witnessed Microsoft ’ s CEO , Satya Nadella , admit that Cortana isn ’ t being positioned to compete directly with the likes of Alexa or Google Assistant , but rather to integrate with these rival solutions . So this move slots neatly in with that angle , and ultimately , this integration is aimed at making Cortana far more powerful and indispensable in the long run , as we saw at Build 2019 . And with Cortana being split from Windows search , with the aim being to eventually turn the assistant into a completely standalone app – separate from Windows 10 – we could see a situation hinted at in December 2018 where vendors can actually choose a third-party assistant for their Windows 10 device rather than Cortana . Aside from that , the fresh preview build contains a fix aiming to reduce the latency involved when inking ( using Windows Ink with a stylus and touchscreen ) . This allows manufacturers to use a latency level based on the actual hardware capabilities of their display and device ( rather than being stuck with a more generalized level of latency selected by the operating system , based on a typical hardware configuration – essentially a best guess situation ) . There are a few other changes detailed in Microsoft ’ s blog post , including more serious bits and pieces for Azure Active Directory , but as we noted at the outset , there ’ s not a huge amount happening elsewhere . That ’ s not surprising , though , given that Microsoft has made it clear that Windows 10 19H2 will be a more minor update which is about tweaking and improving performance , rather than introducing any big new headline features . Don ’ t see any of these features yet on your preview build of Windows 10 ? One final thing to note is that Microsoft also explains that all this fresh functionality is turned off by default currently , and the features will be rolled out gradually . The idea is this more controlled approach will give Microsoft an improved level of feedback on the build quality , putting the developers working on the OS in a better position to fine-tune things as they go along . Microsoft clarified : “ With today ’ s 19H2 build , we are testing this experience . Our plan is to quickly follow-up with another 19H2 build that turns these features on for a subset of Insiders and proceed from there based on feedback and quality . ” So don ’ t be alarmed if you don ’ t see anything yet , but with any luck , you should do shortly…

The Bose SoundSport Free headphones are true wireless earbuds from a respected brand - but they ’ re usually a little on the expensive side . We posited a month ago that they could get a decent price drop on Amazon Prime Day this year , but we 'd thought we 'd found a far cheaper way . Directly from Bose , you could get a pair of SoundSport Free for the deal price of £120 / $ 150 , which is a big drop from the £155 / $ 199 price that they usually retail for - if you get them 'Factory Renewed ' ( ie , with the box already opened ) . But then Amazon Prime Day popped up and we saw the purple variants of these coming in for just $ 139 in the Prime sales , making them $ 11 cheaper than we anticipated : Bose SoundSport headphones| were $ 199 now $ 139.99 at Bose Now , you have to know these are for the purple variants , but in our eyes they look pretty exciting as you work your little heart out running or jumping around . They sound pretty good too , with the strong audio performance you 'd expect from Bose.View Deal The other thing to consider is that , while the SoundSport Free headphones are for exercise… they ’ re not the best for the job . In our list of the best true wireless earbuds , we rate the Jabra Elite Sport earbuds as a much better buy , and they 're down in price too . Sound quality might not be as high as the impressive Bose , but they ’ re overall a great choice , even if they are nearer $ 150 . If you ’ re a Bose fan though , this is a cracking SoundSport Free price to look at - and could be a smart way to get them for cheaper . Sadly this deal is not in the UK - but that renewed deal is still live if you want to check it out .

Bargain hunters have been warned to be on alert today as they shop for the best Amazon Prime Day deals . With Amazon 's mid-year sale extravaganza already in full swing , security firm McAfee has warned shoppers to be on alert for scams looking to take advantage of over-eager bargain hunters . The firm is urging users to take extra care before clicking on adverts or links to deals that seem to good to be true , especially those shared on social media sites or in emails and messages received through platforms such as Facebook , Twitter , WhatsApp . McAfee revealed research on online shopping habits that found over a third ( 39 percent ) of Brits were unable to tell if a website is real or fake - but half said that if the price was cheaper than a trusted retailer , they would purchase from an online site even if they were not fully confident it was genuine or secure . Twenty percent said they would make an online purchase over public or unsecured Wi-Fi , which could expose their payment details and personal information to cybercriminal lurking on the network . An average of £725 per person was lost to these criminals across the UK last year , with one respondent reporting that £48,000 was stolen from their bank account McAfee added that its suspicions had been raised further following the discovery of a phishing kit currently being used in the US and Japan to trick Amazon customers into handing over their personal information . The kit allows hackers to create phishing emails that look like they have come from Amazon and prompt users to share their login credentials on a malicious website , and has already been used to create over 200 malicious URLs . “ Amazon Prime Day is a minefield for shoppers and presents a huge opportunity for cybercriminals to take advantage of unaware Brits . Bargain hunters need to think before they hand over their personal information to get the best deal , without being stung . Never feel panicked to get the best deal and take your time before entering any personal information , '' said Raj Samani , Chief Scientist and Fellow at McAfee . “ Consumers should remember that if an advert for a deal looks too good to be true , it probably is – think before you click on a link to a discount . The same goes for emails and messages you receive through platforms such as Facebook , Twitter and WhatsApp . If a great discount lands in your inbox , you are best off checking out the site directly rather than clicking on any links . ” If you think you have been affected by a scam , McAfee recommends changing the passwords to any potentially compromised accounts , and keeping an eye on banking statements for any unfamiliar transact

Amazon is said to be working on a higher-end Echo smart speaker , according to a new report today , and that 's no surprise given how successful Sonos and Google have been with more powerful versions of their smart speakers . This high-quality Echo packs more audio components into a wider frame than prior models , reports Bloomberg , yet it should still retain its signature cylindrical shape . It will include at least four tweeters , said people familiar with the product . It 's an obvious move for Amazon , which has already cornering the smart speaker market at other price points . But it 's left a void at the top , one that the Sonos Play:1 and Google Home Max have filled . The Echo line of Alexa-powered speakers are frequent best sellers , especially during major sales seasons , like the upcoming Amazon Prime Day 2020 . The bigger Echo is being developed by Amazon ’ s hardware R & D division Lab126 , which had previously reported to be working on an Alexa-controlled home robot called Vesta . Today ’ s news affirms that work continues on the domestic ‘ bot , which was expected to be at least introduced this year , but is reportedly not ready for mass-production . Just what Vesta can do is still a mystery , but today ’ s Bloomberg report sheds more light on the product : prototypes are around waist-height and get around thanks to computer-vision cameras . That sounds like the kind of computer-assisted navigation that Amazon has left to Google ’ s Waymo and Apple ’ s self-driving car experiments , which is intriguing territory for a company that made its bones on hardware basics . Details are still scarce about both projects , and neither are seemingly far enough along to have release dates .
It seems Amazon isn ’ t the only company who hires people to eavesdrop on conversations you have with your voice assistant – Google has now been caught out doing the same thing , too . Belgian broadcaster VRT NWS has reported that Google hires contractors to listen and transcribe audio recordings of users talking to Google Assistant , either via a smart speaker or their phones . One such contractor provided the broadcaster with over 1,000 recordings for an investigation into the transcription process . It was found that many of the recordings included identifiable personal details of users , while 153 conversations were seemingly recorded by accident , as the wake command of “ OK Google ” or “ Hey Google ” wasn ’ t used to trigger the digital assistant . According to the report , Google employs thousands of contractors around the world to transcribe Assistant conversations , although they all use a secure login to access the recordings via the company ’ s Crowdsource app . You can watch the original report , with English subtitles , in the video below . Although it 's no secret Google collects user data and stores recorded conversations with Assistant , the company has not previously disclosed the fact that humans also listen to some of these interactions . After VRT NWS broke the news , Google published a blog post defending the practice , stating that the system is necessary to learn more about user behavior and to improve Assistant ’ s algorithms and customer experience . Hiring people from around the world means the company ’ s “ speech technology works for a wide variety of languages , accents and dialects ” , thus “ [ enabling ] products like the Google Assistant to understand your request , whether you ’ re speaking English or Hindi ” . According to Google , contractors listen to only 0.2 % of all audio clips and none are “ associated with user accounts ” . Moreover , transcribers are instructed “ not to transcribe background conversations or other noises , and only to transcribe snippets that are directed to Google ” . Google also says there are “ a number of protections in place to prevent false accepts from occurring ” , which is when Assistant is triggered accidentally by “ some noise or words in the background ” . A contractor leaking audio clips to a news outlet , Google says , is a violation of its data security policies . The incident is being investigated by the company , and it says action will be taken against the leaker . Google is also reviewing the policies it has in place for its transcribers “ to prevent misconduct like this from happening again ” . Via The Guardian

On Amazon Prime Day , having an Amazon Prime membership will be essential if you want to enjoy those exclusive deals . But what about afterwards , when the deals have all gone ? Is it worth keeping your membership going ? There 's a no-commitment 30-day free trial you can get by signing up to Prime here : - US free trial - UK free trial - Canada free trial - India free trial - Australia free trial Amazon Prime members will frequently see items with Prime member-exclusive prices on various items at Amazon all year round and you 'll get early access to Lightning Deals before non-members . And on the best deals , that could well be the difference between buying an item , and it being sold out by the time you 're given a shot . We 're not even exaggerating , we 've seen Nintendo Switch deals last less than 90 seconds around big flagship sales events like Black Friday . But it 's not all about buying . Amazon Prime has a lot of excellent benefits that are often overlooked amongst all the furore around the Amazon Prime Day deals . Let us show you the best ones that might convince you to keep your Prime membership going after Prime Day . Amazon Prime 's Instant video streaming service has come a long way since its early days and is well worth having even if you already have Netflix . Both streaming services offer enough unique content nowadays to justify owning both . And Amazon has some fantastic shows to get stuck . Be sure to check out fantastic hits like Good Omens , American Gods , Mr Robot , Hanna , The Grand Tour ( ok , this one was n't as fantastic as we 'd hoped ) , Vikings , Into the Badlands , The Expanse and The Americans . We 've rounded up a longer list of the best Amazon Prime TV shows for you . We 're frequently surprised by just how new some of its movies are too and while there are n't as many free options as Netflix there 's a strong selection amongst the best Amazon Prime movies . Amazon Prime Instant Video can be shared too . You can actually stream content on three different devices if you 're willing to share your Amazon account login with any housemates or family members ( you can always log their device in yourself without giving them your password directly ) . The other people streaming do n't even have to live at the same address , making it very easy for family members to enjoy the video service for free . If you 're sharing with flatmates , you could split the cost of membership considering you can both enjoy the fast post and streaming benefits so easily . Speaking of which ... Amazon used to have free standard delivery on even the cheapest of purchases , but it gradually increased the minimum spend amount , making Prime membership 's free delivery benefit a key factor in selling it to regular shoppers . But considering the other benefits and the faster delivery times Prime offers , it 's not the end of the world . UK buyers get the fastest widespread delivery , with free next day delivery on millions of items . In the US it 's generally a two-day service , but things are improving with over 10,000 towns and cites now eligible for free same-day or one-day delivery on millions of products . In Australia , where Amazon is still very much an up and coming business ( if you can believe that ) , customers can get expedited delivery on a large selection of items with delivery promised within two business days . And as a part of your membership to Amazon Prime , another adult in your household can enjoy these super fast delivery options too . And no , it wo n't cost either of you anything extra . They do n't have to share your surname , so it works for flatmates , girlfriends , boyfriends , siblings - anyone that lives at the same address . Brilliantly though , we 've found that this secondary person can also get items delivered to another address if needed - like their place of work for example . How does on-demand access to two million songs sound ? Well they 're all yours as a part of your Amazon Prime membership . You can even request music from your Alexa-enabled smart speaker , which is perfect if you take advantage of those cheap Amazon Echo deals on Prime Day . You can download these tracks to listen to offline on your phone or MP3 player , which is great for creating jogging playlists or tunes for the beach on your holidays . And unlike last year , this service is now available in Australia too . If you want to join Amazon 's even bigger Music Unlimited service ( 40 million songs ) , then you 'll find your Amazon Prime membership entitles you to an exclusive discount on the monthly price at just $ 7.99/£7.99 instead of $ 9.99/£9.99 in the US and UK . If you 're quick , you can take advantage of a super cheap promo where you can get a massive saving . In the UK/US right now , it 's just $ 0.99/99p for the first four months and AU $ 0.99 in Australia . Buried down the list of benefits is a large selection of ebooks to download to your Kindle or the Kindle app on your phone/tablet free of charge . Most genres are covered with over a thousand books , magazines , comics and more available to Amazon Prime members . Your mileage will vary depending on what you like to read and you wo n't be finding brand new titles being added to this perk anytime soon , but it 's well worth looking into if you 're an Amazon Prime member already or are considering the full benefit while on an Amazon Prime free trial . You 'll be able to pick up a cheap Kindle deal on an e-reader around Prime Day for sure , so this is a great way to grab a few free books to get you going . If you 're a super keen bookworm , there 's actually a terrific offer going on Kindle Unlimited ( think of it like the Netflix of ebooks ) right now . For the first three months , you do n't have to pay a thing , it 's a completely free trial extended way beyond the usual 30 days . We 've rounded up the details for the US/UK membership and the Australian version too . One of the more gamer-friendly perks you can enjoy with Amazon Prime , in addition to getting super fast delivery on the newest games and hardware , is the free Twitch Prime membership . This is a great bonus if you enjoy watching live streams of games on the massively popular service . You 'll get free in-game DLC on select titles , ad-free viewing , a free channel subscription every 30 days and some exclusive member discounts like $ 10 credit on select pre-orders for US gamers . You also get free games with Twitch Prime each month . The free games and DLC are usually for PC , just so you know . There 's not long to go for Amazon Prime Day 2019 now . If you do n't want to miss out on the best bargains , be sure to bookmark our dedicated Prime Day deals ( USA ) , best Amazon Prime Day deals ( UK ) and Australian Prime Day deals . You 'll also find coverage of the best Amazon Prime Day deals in India . If you 're ready for an Amazon Prime free trial you can sign up via these links for the USA , UK , Canada , India and Australia .

Things are heating up extra early for this year 's big sale . That 's right , we 're edging ever closer to the best Amazon Prime Day deals that officially kick off on July 15 . But Amazon is already stoking our interests with tempting offers on a range of its memberships and keen readers should take note of this one especially . You can now sign up for three whole months of Kindle Unlimited for absolutely nothing . Usually you only get 30-days free , but this is a huge , albeit temporary improvement . Three-months should give you plenty of time to consider if you want to become a paying member at $ 9.99/£7.99 a month afterwards . If you 're not quite getting through enough books a month to make it worthwhile you might find that just paying for individual titles at your leisure is the better option . This is absolutely the best offer we 've ever seen for trying Kindle Unlimited . Note , you need to be an Amazon Prime member to take advantage of this extra long free trial period . On the plus side , you can sign up for a free 30-day trial of Amazon Prime right now . And we 'd certainly advise doing so if you have n't already as the Prime Day deals are strictly members-only , so do n't miss out . If you 're in the US and do n't have Prime and do n't really fancy it , you 'll have the option of getting three months for $ 9.99 which is still a lot better than the $ 29.97 it would usually cost . Prime membership is also plenty handy for super fast delivery on millions of items and there 's loads of content to watch for TV and movie fans on the Prime Video streaming service . Check out our picks of the best Amazon Prime TV shows and best Amazon Prime movies to set up your next binge . Amazon 's Kindle titles can of course be read on Kindle e-readers , but you can also enjoy them via apps on your smartphone or tablet . Kindle e-readers are our favorite way to read ebooks though as they offer epic battery life and the screens are excellent for glare-free reading . If you 've fancied picking one up for a while , you 're almost at the perfect time to do so . Kindle Unlimited is n't just about having the equivalent of the Netflix of ebooks at your disposal , the service has a huge collection of magazines , graphic novels and audiobooks included with the subscription service too . Amazon Prime Day will see loads of items discounted between July 15-16 and Kindles get fantastic deals every time , often the cheapest prices of the year . And seeing as current prices are sat at the full MSRP/RRP you should absolutely wait . If you want to compare the different models available , head on over to our best Kindle prices and deals guide for a detailed rundown . Music fans may want to take advantage of a huge discount on the Amazon Music Unlimited service too .
There 's a lot of stuff on Amazon these days . From its humble beginnings as on online bookstore , the massive retailer has since incorporated all sorts of gadgets , clothing , DVDs , and home and outdoor goods – not to mention a vast media empire of music , movies , and TV shows – and a massive annual Prime Day sale driving deal-seekers to the site . But when those products break , or cease to function , who exactly is responsible ? This question came into the limelight this week after a US appeals court found Amazon liable for faulty third-party goods sold through its site – which make up around half of the items available on the website . 'Third-party ' just means products that are n't made by Amazon , but are sold through its marketplace . These can be either shipped directly to customers by the seller , or distributed through Amazon 's warehouses . But , as reported by Reuters , a federal appeals court has ruled ( two to one , in a three judge panel ) that Amazon is liable even for the products it does n't make itself . The case was brought against Amazon by a woman in Pennsylvania , who lost the vision in her left eye after a retractable dog leash snapped during use , colliding with her face and causing permanent injury . Judge Jane Richards Roth said that Amazon 's business model “ enables third-party vendors to conceal themselves from the customer , leaving customers injured by defective products with no direct recourse to the third-party vendor ” . While there are a lot of quality goods on Amazon , though , there 's also a lot of junk . Arguably part of Amazon 's success has stemmed from its ability to offer cheap alternatives to goods sold by many other retailers , and they will inevitably vary in quality . The huge number of items available also leaves Amazon open to a lot of potential lawsuits , if it 's considered liable for their functionality . At the moment , the ruling is only in Pennsylvania , US , but if this line of thinking catches on elsewhere , it could mean a new , higher quality standard is introduced across the board – likely improving the customer experience of third-party products , but probably driving up costs in the process .

It looks like Samsung could be about to launch a new tablet - or rather , upgrade an old one - with leaked specs claiming to be for the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0 ( 2019 ) hitting the web . If you want a powerful tablet you 're best off looking at iPads , but many people do n't need Apple 's powerhouses , and look to the more affordable end of the market instead – and offerings such as Samsung 's Galaxy Tab A range . German website Winfuture says it has got hold of a spec list for the upcoming tablet , which is set to replace the older Galaxy Tab A 8.0 model , and the list gives us an idea of what to expect when the tablet launches in the near future . First up the leak says the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 ( 2019 ) display is set to be 8 inches – that 's literally in the name , so we 'd be very , very surprised if it turned out not to be true . According to the leak , the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 ( 2019 ) will run on a Snapdragon 429 chipset , a low-end SoC ( system on chip ) launched in 2018 and designed for budget smartphones – so you wo n't be getting a huge amount of processing power in the slate , but its 'Tab A ' title already gave that away . Joining that chipset , the leak suggests the tablet will have just 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory . These numbers seem rather low , but with cloud storage getting more popular , internal memory is n't the most important thing any more . Saying that , 32GB storage is still rather low , but the specs list suggests there will be a microSD memory card slot to solve this issue . Powering the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 is a 5,100mAh battery , according to the leak , which is n't exactly a huge power pack , but it 'll easily see you through a long-ish flight or family gathering . There 's also set to be a 3.5mm headphone jack – it seems Samsung is n't ditching the port in its slates that it is in its phones . In terms of cameras , you could be seeing slightly worse specs than in the recent Galaxy Tab A 10.5 , as while both have an 8MP rear camera , the older device had a 5MP front-facing snapper , while the 8.0 model apparently will only see a 2MP camera . Tablet cameras always have lower resolutions than smartphones , so that 's not exactly a huge surprise , and you 'll be mostly using it for video calls and chats . That 's most of the important information about the tablet , and there 's one thing left to know – is it worthy of your money ? There 's no way to know until it 's been released , but stay tuned to TechRadar when it does for our expert reviews . With a potentially new tablet on the way , it could mean the current Galaxy Tab A series are in line for discounts during Amazon Prime Day , which runs July 15-16 .

The Duo60 was on sale last year for $ 58.99 , which was the lowest price we 've seen for the pressure cooker .

Back in April , it emerged that Amazon employees could be listening to recordings of Amazon Echo speaker users ' conversations with Alexa – and now , it 's been revealed that those recordings can be kept indefinitely by the company and , in some cases , are being shared with third-parties . This has come to light after US Senator Chris Coons sent a letter to Amazon asking `` how long it kept voice recordings and transcripts , as well as what the data gets used for '' , according to Cnet . In his response , Amazon 's vice president of public policy Brian Huseman revealed that the company keeps voice recordings and transcripts from Alexa interactions indefinitely , only removing them when `` the customer chooses to delete them '' . Customers can `` review , listen to , and delete voice recordings associated with their account using the Voice History feature available in the Alexa app and the Alexa Privacy Hub '' , according to Amazon 's response letter . However , there are recordings Amazon wo n't delete at all , even if users remove the audio using this feature . These include requests involving a transaction like `` ordering a pizza or hailing a ride share '' – the Alexa skill 's developers , which can be third-party companies like Dominoes or Uber , can keep a record of that transaction . As Cnet points out , that means there 's a record of `` nearly every purchase you make on Amazon 's Alexa '' . Huseman 's letter also noted that other types of Alexa requests like setting a recurring alarm are also retained . He justified this by explaining that `` customers would not want or expect deletion of the voice recording to delete the underlying data or prevent Alexa from performing the requested task '' . In response to the Coons ' question about the purpose of retaining transcripts of voice recordings , Huseman writes that `` machine learning systems need to be trained using real world data '' . `` Training Alexa with voice recordings and transcripts from a diverse range of customers helps ensure Alexa works well for everyone '' , he says . For his part , Coons is unimpressed by Amazon 's response to his concerns . In a statement , the Senator said : `` Amazon 's response leaves open the possibility that transcripts of user voice interactions with Alexa are not deleted from all of Amazon 's servers , even after a user has deleted a recording of his or her voice '' . `` What 's more , the extent to which this data is shared with third parties , and how those third parties use and control that information , is still unclear . '' Should that put you off buying an Amazon Echo speaker like the Echo Dot , or a smart display like the Echo Show ? It 's hard to say , and largely depends on how privacy-conscious you are . If previous claims of Amazon employees listening to recordings to train Alexa have n't bothered you so far , then chances are the knowledge that some of your transaction history is being stored wo n't either . Plus , Echo speakers could be about to get a hefty discount with Amazon Prime Day 2020 on the way – the price you put on your privacy is down to you .

Amazon Prime Day 2020 may be just around the corner , but if you ca n't wait that long for some Amazon Prime membership perks then you 're in luck as Rockstar Games is offering free cash to GTA Online and Red Dead Online players ( in-game money only , sorry ) . Well , technically the virtual cash is being gifted to Twitch Prime members – but those with an Amazon Prime subscription can automatically be upgraded to Twitch Prime by linking their Amazon account to their Twitch account . Rockstar is handing out a whopping $ 1,250,000 for free to Twitch Prime/Amazon Prime members in GTA Online , while Red Dead Online players are being gifted a modest $ 300 . In addition , any GTA Online players who use real-world money to purchase in-game cash will earn an extra 15 % in-game currency . The same goes for Red Dead Online players who purchase in-game gold bars with real-world money . To claim your free cash , firstly make sure you 're an Amazon Prime member . Then ensure that your Amazon account is linked to Twitch , which will automatically upgrade your Twitch account to Twitch Prime . Next , link your Twitch Prime account to your Rockstar Games Social Club . The cash should automatically unlock after 30 minutes of play once this is done but , if you 're a new player in either game , you need to make sure you 've finished the tutorial before the free cash will be made available . If you are n't sure if Amazon Prime is for you , you 'll be happy to know that this offer still applies to those making use of Amazon Prime 's 30 day free-trial period . According to Rockstar , this is the first of a series of bonuses Twitch prime members can look forward to this year . Source : The Sun
Amazon has announced that certain Alexa skills will now be able to work together to act upon your requests and commands . Called 'skill connections ' , the new feature enables a skill to `` use another skill to perform a specific task '' . So , if a company has an Alexa skill that helps users find highly-rated restaurants in the local area , it could add a skill connection with another company whose skill helps users book tables at restaurants . This means that Amazon Echo users will `` no longer [ need ] to relay details between separate skills '' , which will hopefully make the Alexa experience more streamlined . We all know that Amazon Alexa is pretty smart already – the voice assistant can read you the news , control your smart home , and even tell you jokes . However , much of Alexa 's functionality comes from its skills , many of which are created by third-party brands who want to make their service or product available to Amazon Echo users . These 'skills ' are essentially tricks that your Amazon smart speaker can perform for you – from turning on the security lights in your back garden through to ordering a pizza to your front door . So far , Alexa skills have been somewhat disconnected ; as Slash Gear points out , `` rivaling companies raced to grab a piece of the Alexa or Google Assistant market '' in the early days of the skills system , which means that they became `` isolated gardens '' . If Amazon 's hope is that skill connections will bridge the gap between these different skills , it will need to rely on companies to implement the new feature – and to play nicely with each other . So far , skill connections are only available for printing , booking taxis , and booking restaurant reservations , but hopefully this list will grow , making the feature truly beneficial to users of Amazon Echo devices and other Alexa-enabled gadgets . If the idea of connected skills appeals to you and you 're thinking of buying an Echo speaker , it might be worth holding off until Amazon Prime Day 2020 . We 're expecting to see significant savings across a range of Amazon devices , including the Echo , Echo Plus , Echo Dot , Echo Show , and perhaps even the latest addition to the range , the Amazon Echo Show 5 . The event kicks off on July 15 , and last for 48 hours – we 'll be reporting on all the best Prime Day deals , so make sure you check back with TechRadar then . Via Slash Gear

Amazon Cloud Cam gives Alexa a new sense : sight . It ’ s a security camera and a pet camera , a motion detector and even a two-way intercom that you can use to chat to the kids or bark at the dog . Amazon Cloud Cam was introduced in late 2017 , although at the time it lacked the ability to watch via a web browser ( that ’ s now been added ) . It was designed to work with Amazon Key , Amazon ’ s security service that enables customers to control access to their home for appointments and deliveries . Amazon also suggests that you might want to use it to check in on the kids when you ’ re cooking in the kitchen , or monitor the front door while traveling . It ’ s a direct competitor to the Google-owned Nest cameras , as well as the recent wave of Wi-Fi-enabled , cloud-connected security products . We 're expecting it to be a big hitter due to some meaty discounts during Amazon Prime Day , which will be beginning on July 15 and lasts for two whole days this time . Amazon Cloud Cam is a connected security camera that records and streams video in 1080p whenever it detects motion ; the camera is only enabled when motion is detected , so it ’ s not recording 24/7 . Amazon Cloud Cam has night vision LEDs that can see in the dark , a microphone so it can hear , and a speaker so that you can talk through it , and it works with Alexa . To see what the camera can see , just ask Alexa to show your video feed . You can then watch live or watch the recorded clips on your phone or tablet , Amazon Fire TV , Fire tablet , Echo Show or Echo Spot . Of course , the main feature of a security camera is to let you know if something happens when you aren ’ t watching . Amazon Cloud Cam will notify your phone or Echo device whenever it thinks there ’ s something you should know about , such as the sound of breaking glass or an unauthorized visitor . You can adjust the frequency of the notifications by turning off 'Motion Detected ' in the app ’ s Settings . Once notified you can watch the live feed on your phone , your Amazon device , or via your web browser . Amazon Cloud Cam also stores footage in the cloud so you can review it later , although if you don ’ t have a subscription that storage only lasts for 24 hours . At the time of writing , Amazon Cloud Cam is only available to Amazon customers in the US , and we 're waiting to see if Amazon makes it more widely available . A single Cloud Cam costs $ 119.99 ( roughly £95 / AU $ 170 ) , or $ 139.99 ( around £110 / AU $ 200 ) if you want one that works with Amazon Key , and multi-buy offers can reduce the price . You ’ ll also need a monthly or annual subscription to get the best from it - and it 's often subject to seasonal discounts too . As mentioned , keep an eye on Amazon sales events such as Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday , when Amazon tends to offer good deals on its own devices . The Amazon Cloud Cam comes in a smart white finish , and has a 1080p camera that can record at up to 30fps , with eight infrared LEDs for night vision and a 120-degree field of view . There ’ s an ambient light sensor , an omni-directional microphone , a small speaker and a micro USB port with a 10-foot power cord . There ’ s no battery backup and no display ; everything is controlled via the companion app . The app is available for iOS , Android and Fire OS . The Cloud Cam works with 802.11g and 802.11n Wi-Fi , and an upload speed of 2Mbps is recommended . Amazon ’ s Cloud Cam may be a new product , but it ’ s based on the same old business model as traditional security systems : for the best protection you need to take out a subscription , and here that subscription comes in three different flavors : Basic , Extended and Pro – see below for details of these . Some of the Cloud Cam ’ s best features are only available to subscribers . Person detection uses intelligent image analysis to tell the difference between people and things , so you ’ ll be notified when the kids come home or if someone is trying to steal your TV , but you won ’ t be interrupted if a leaf blows past or a curtain moves . Zones are really useful . These enable you to tell Alexa to ignore particular bits of the room , so for example if you have glass doors or really big windows you can exclude them to prevent the slightest outside movement from triggering the alarm . Zones can also be used for indoor things such as fish tanks , or for walls that tend to get a lot of light reflections . The Basic plan gives you seven days of cloud storage and supports up to three cameras . Extended doubles the storage time to 14 days and supports up to five cameras , while Pro takes the storage up to 30 days and the number of cameras to 10 . You ’ ll save a lot if you pay upfront for a year . The Basic plan is $ 6.99 a month or $ 69.99 a year , a saving of just under $ 14 ; Extended is $ 9.99 / $ 99.99 , saving you just under $ 20 ; and Pro is $ 19.99 a month or $ 199.99 per year , a saving of just under $ 40 . That ’ s an interesting question . The official line is that your video is stored on Amazon ’ s servers and isn ’ t shared with any third parties , and Amazon has a pretty good record on security . However , we also know that a lot of Alexa ’ s intelligence comes from humans listening in , and in early 2018 Alexa accidentally sent an entire private conversation to someone in its owners ’ address book – an accident that , according to Amazon ’ s explanation , required an almost impossible combination of extremely unlikely circumstances . So while you should n't have to worry too much , if you are concerned about privacy then you might want to be careful about what you do in view of your Cloud Cam Google ’ s the big one here : its Nest products include two indoor cameras , an outdoor camera and a doorbell . They ’ re all more expensive than the Amazon Cloud Cam , though : the cheapest indoor camera is $ 199 / £159 / AU $ 249 , although it ’ s sometimes discounted by retailers . Like Amazon Cloud Cam , Nest cameras need a subscription to unlock their best features : they ’ re $ 5 / £4 / AU $ 7 per month for five days of video history , $ 10 / £8 / AU $ 14 for 10 , or $ 30 / £24 / AU $ 30 for 30 days of recording . That ’ s for one camera . Each additional camera requires a subscription too , and they ’ re billed at 50 % of the normal cost – so it ’ s $ 2.50 / £2 / AU $ 3.50 to $ 15 / £12 / AU $ 15 per additional camera per month . Amazon has all the blurb right here .
Apex Legends has quickly become the jewel in EA 's crown , after astonishing plater numbers for the Fortnite-rival battle royale . And any players will be glad to know that EA has plenty of Apex Legends loot to give away this Amazon Prime Day . The online retailer Amazon is set to unleash a horde of deals in the coming weeks in the run to – and certainly during – this year 's Prime Day sales . Through the partnership with EA , there will also be a number of skins , items and goodies for Apex Legends and various EA Sports games . Anyone with a Twitch Prime account is eligible for the free content , meaning you 'll need to have subscribed to Amazon Prime and connected it to your Twitch.tv profile . As of July 3 , that includes an `` exclusive Legend skin and weapon skin '' for Apex Legends , with more skins and content available throughout July and August – and unspecified gifts through `` multiple EA Sports titles '' . It seems like most , if not all of it will be cosmetic items , rather than anything that gives an unfair advantage on the battlefield , and we 're yet to see the designs – though part of us wants something as delightfully naff as a corporate Amazon Prime logo . Either way , it should provide some alternative looks for those wanting to stand out from the pack . Amazon will be going big on celebrations on July 13 with an eight-hour live-stream on Twitch Prime , kicking off at 6pm BST / 1pm EST / 10am PT , with the likes of gold-medallist Mo Farah and footballer Thierry Henry competing on the virtual playing field . With a concert headlined by Dua Lipa and Taylor Swift a few days before , it 's clear Amazon is looking to make this year 's Prime Day as big an event as it can . The Twitch.tv streaming site is a hugely popular hub for watching and sharing game playthroughs or competitive play , with a number of perks when upgrading your account with an Amazon Prime subscription . Alongside the addition of faster delivery ( not necessarily one-day ) and Prime member-exclusive deals , you also get access to the Amazon Prime Music and Amazon Prime Video services , as well as free monthly games through the Twitch.tv platform . A number of new skins might not excite everyone , but we recommend keeping an eye out for deals or giveaways that do take your fancy . With Amazon dealing in everything from music and films to smart speakers and e-books , there 'll likely be something for you when Amazon Prime Day hits on July 15-16 .
If you have an Amazon Fire TV device and you use it to watch live television , you 'll be pleased to know that finding live TV channels is about to get easier than ever before . The company has announced that Fire TV devices in the US will be getting a new dedicated 'Live ' tab , which the company says will bring `` your live sports , news , and channels from select OTT services , streaming apps ( e.g . PlayStation Vue ) , paid subscriptions , and over-the-air antennas into one consolidated view '' . Amazon says that you will be able to find the new live TV tab `` right next to ‘ Home ’ in the main navigation menu '' . As well as coming to devices like the Amazon Fire TV Stick , the new feature will also be available on Fire TV Edition smart TVs . So , what can you expect to see within the Live tab on your Fire device ? There are Live TV integrated apps like Pluto TV and Red Bull TV , which offer free live content , as well as monthly subscription apps like PlayStation Vue . You can also subscribe to Prime Video Channels , which gives you access to live content from HBO , Showtime , NBA League Pass , and more . Plus , if you have a Fire TV Edition smart TV or a Fire TV Recast , you 'll find all your regular antenna channels `` listed alongside your other live content '' in the Live tab . Amazon says that the feature will be rolling out `` over the next week '' to all Fire TV customers in the US – that means you can expect to see it on your interface sometime between July 1 and July 7 ( just in time for Wimbledon , as Amazon points out ) . If you 're looking for a simple way to stream TV , an Amazon Fire TV device can be a great choice . While the original Fire TV ( 2017 ) that started it all is no more , the more compact Fire TV Stick has taken its place . With the Fire Stick ’ s 4K upgrade , too , choosing between Fire TV devices is now as simple as picking HD or Ultra HD for your TV streaming . The regular Fire TV Stick retails at $ 39.99 , while the Fire TV Stick 4K is slightly more expensive at $ 49.99 . If you want to combine your music and TV into one device , there 's also the Amazon Fire TV Cube , which is essentially a Fire TV streaming box built into an Amazon Echo speaker . This is the most expensive option at $ 119.99 . But is now the best time to buy ? With Amazon Prime Day 2020 fast approaching , chances are that we 'll see some fantastic Fire TV Stick deals on July 15 . This year 's Prime Day is set to be the biggest yet , with 48 hours of sales kicking off from 00:01 Monday , July 15 and last until 23:59 of Tuesday , July 16 .

Amazon is offering the Microsoft Surface Go tablet with the maximum storage available for almost $ 100 off in a Deal of the Day . The 10-inch Windows tablet is a favorite of ours , bringing ultra-mobile and budget-strapped customers a much more fitting version of the Surface tablet . In fact , we gave the tablet 4.5 stars and our 'Recommended ' award . Microsoft Surface Go ( 4GB/128GB ) is $ 482 $ 385 on Amazon This excellent , $ 96 discount on the Surface Go gets you Microsoft 's tiniest tablet , and only the tablet , for less than the list price for the entry-level model . Deal expires on August 30 at 3:00am ET/12:00am PT.View Deal However , it 's important to note that this Surface Go deal does not include the Microsoft Type Cover ( $ 129 ) nor does it include the Surface Pen ( $ 99 ) . Collectively , getting the complete Surface Go experience will cost an additional $ 230 , roughly speaking . This is , unfortunately , par for the course for Microsoft Surface products and has been for a few years now . Ultimately , with this deal , you could get the Surface Go in this configuration for just $ 615 . In comparison to the $ 779 this complete setup would cost you normally – albeit with 4GB more RAM – you 're saving $ 165 altogether . We bring all of this up , rather than simply tell you that the tablet is 100 bucks off , because the Surface Go is n't really a complete product without at least that Type Cover . Regardless , this is the cheapest the Surface Go with 128GB of storage is likely to be between now and Black Friday .

Fitbit just announced the Versa 2 , which is an update to its best-selling smartwatch that brings a variety of new features to your wrist – as well as some under the hood improvements . The most exciting new feature is that the Fitbit Versa 2 comes with Amazon Alexa built-in . That means you 're able to ask Alexa for details in a similar way to how you interact with an Amazon Echo speaker . This feature of course wo n't work in regions where Alexa is n't available - such as the UAE . You can just hold the button on the left of the watch down for a few seconds , and then ask Alexa your query . For example , say `` what 's the weather like in London today '' and you 'll get a similar response to the image above . The design is similar to the last version of the Fitbit Versa , but the screen is 8 % bigger allowing for a slightly amount more to appear on the watch 's display . We 've yet to the learn the exact specs of the screen , but we know it 's an AMOLED display . Fitbit says the watch should last for over five days with regular usage , which is a whole day more than the estimate of the original Versa . The watch comes with Connected GPS – so you 'll need to take your phone with your to track your location – as well as activity tracking and a 24/7 heart rate monitor too . Fitbit Pay comes on the watch as standard , but you 'll need to make sure you have a compatible bank to be able to use it . It 's also water-resistant too , so you 'll be able to take this watch running with you . It comes running Fitbit OS software , which is set to see a variety of improvements including a new Sleep Score feature that gives you a clearer picture of how well your night 's sleep went with a score of zero to 100 . You can also control Spotify on the watch with a Fitbit app , but there 's currently no offline play available on the device . For that you 'll have to upload your own tracks to the watch or use Deezer 's playlist feature . September 15 is the Fitbit Versa 2 release date for those in the US , while the UK and UAE has been told it 's coming in mid-September . There 's currently no clear release date for Australia , but we 're expecting to see the watch land there , too . The Fitbit Versa 2 costs £199.99 / $ 199.95 / AU $ 299.95 / AED899 , plus there 's also a special edition of the watch that costs more and comes with a different strap . Fitbit has also unveiled a new pair of smart scales called the Fitbit Aria Air that are more affordable than its existing Fitbit Aria 2 . These will be able to monitor your weight and connect via Bluetooth . Fitbit is selling these for £49.99 / $ 49.95 ( about AU $ 75 ) and these will be available from some point in October . Plus there 's new service from the company that offers a full health program for you , and it 's called Fitbit Premium .
Amazon may be planning a major move into more software fields after it announced two new subscription offers for users of its popular Eero home mesh networking Wi-Fi system . Eero Secure and Eero Secure+ follow a path well treaded by others usch as Invizbox , Bitdefender or Norton Core or Cujo . In a nutshell , take a layer of hardware and add privacy-related software to it . $ 29.99 per year ( or $ 2.99 per month ) gets users the Eero Secure plan , which includes advanced security for all devices connected to the Eero system , content filtering and ad-blocking at hardware level . Eero Secure + ( formerly known as Eero Plus ) costs $ 9.99 per month or $ 99.99 for a year and bundles a VPN from Encrypt.me , antivirus protection from Malwarebytes and password management from 1Password . Bought separately , the trio would cost you nearly $ 280 for a family of five . Assuming that Eero Secure + has no connection limits , that represents a saving of nearly 65 percent for that scenario . We have reached out to Amazon for more information about the above , but the launch could prove to be the start of something big for the ecommerce giant . VPN and antivirus were already part of Eero ’ s offering before Amazon bought it back in February 2019 . Given Amazon ’ s clout and its immense subscription base via Prime - it has more than 100 million subscribers in the US alone - means that it could both the VPN and antivirus markets , very significantly . What ’ s more , Amazon is one of the largest owners - if not the largest owner - of compute , storage and networking resources in the world thanks to the millions of servers it hosts . That ’ s several orders of magnitude bigger than even the biggest VPN provider out there .

The Amazon Kindle Oasis is Amazon ’ s highest-end ereader , so it goes for a fitting price . The baseline 8GB storage space costs $ 249.99 / £229.99 / AU $ 399 , while the 32GB option is priced at $ 279.99 / £259.99 / AU $ 449 . For four times the storage space that ’ s only an increase of $ 30 / £30 / AU $ 50 , so if you ’ re planning to download loads of books at once , we ’ d recommend the latter option . If those prices make you weak in the knees , perhaps the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is a better deal for you . An 8GB Paperwhite will cost you $ 129.99 / £119.99 / AU $ 199 , and 32GB will set you back $ 159.99 / £149.99 / AU $ 249 , making it a lot more affordable than the Oasis . Bear in mind , you ’ re going to be paying a bit more cash for Amazon Kindle Unlimited , or to buy your ebooks individually , so your expense doesn ’ t stop at the hardware itself . When you think of an Amazon Kindle ereader , you probably envision the standard flat rectangle design found in most tablets these days - and that ’ s exactly what the Kindle Paperwhite looks like . It ’ s got a plastic body framing the display , and is a touch bigger than your standard smartphone , so it gives a different ‘ feel ’ than just reading on Google Play Books . The Amazon Kindle Oasis has a far more intriguing design : on the back of the body is a large ridge that offers a natural hand-hold to make the ereader easy to grip in a range of situations ( like walking , or laying on your back ) . For its premium price tag you get a range of other improvements on the Paperwhite , like the metal body and physical buttons to help you navigate pages quickly . In terms of screens , the Paperwhite has a 6-inch display , which is short of the Oasis ’ 7-inch screen but both have the same 300 pixel-per-inch resolution . The Oasis really shines ( pun intended ) through its range of extra display options , like a high max brightness and an optional orange ‘ warm light ’ intended to reduce eye strain when reading . The Kindle Oasis has the superior design and display over the Paperwhite , and this makes it a better device for certain audiences , like people who constantly bash or drop their device , or have sensitive eyes , but the design improvements might not be necessary for all users . While we don ’ t have exact battery sizes for the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite or Oasis , during the course of our review we made a few estimations based on how long they lasted and how quickly the battery dropped . This isn ’ t quite a scientific or empirical way of measuring the battery life of either device , but without specs it ’ s the closest we can do – and the winner is pretty clear . The ridge on the back of the Kindle Oasis is n't just a handgrip – it houses the ereader ’ s chunky battery , so you can expect the device to last a long time . In our review , we estimated the Oasis could last about six weeks if used for half an hour a day , which meets Amazon ’ s official estimations . The Kindle Paperwhite , on the other hand , seems to last about three weeks if used the same amount of time , depending of course on how bright the display is . So it seems like the Kindle Oasis lasts for twice as long ; although both last for such a long period of time that the difference is kind of moot . It 's far less annoying than having to recharge your smartphone every day . Both the Amazon Kindle Oasis and Paperwhite run Amazon ’ s Kindle operating system , which lets you rent or buy books on the Amazon Store , and there ’ s not much difference in terms of software . Neither ereader has a 3.5mm headphone jack though , so if you want to listen to an audiobook , you ’ ll have to do it with a wireless headphone . Talking of ports , both the Kindle Paperwhite and Oasis charge up using micro USB . That ’ s quite an outdated socket , so the devices are quite slow to charge . In fact , the Kindle Oasis and Paperwhite have most features in common , and once you ’ ve looked past the surface appearances , they ’ re rather similar devices . The main differences between the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Oasis lie in their designs and displays . The Oasis aims to be easy to hold in your hand , and even easier to drop without worrying about it breaking , thanks to its metal chassis . Screen versatility is a big difference too , and the Oasis ’ warm light , as well as its increased max brightness , make it a better device for reading in the dark or in bright sunlight . Beyond that , the two devices are rather similar in terms of operating system and user interface , so you ’ re not going to get a terrible experience on the Paperwhite compared to its premium-priced sibling . So if you ’ ve got a lot of money to spend on a new device , or the design or display features of the Oasis are vital to you , it ’ s definitely the device to look for , but if you just want to buy an ereader tablet to get through all your books and comics , then the Paperwhite may be a more viable - and certainly more affordable - choice .

The Sony Xperia 1 is one of the most powerful Sony phones you can buy , but that means it 's also one of the most pricey , with a launch price tag of $ 949 . Amazon 's got an antidote to that scary price – but it comes with a catch . If you 're an Amazon Prime member , and based in the US , you can make the most of a Sony Xperia 1 deal that sees $ 100 off the price , but in exchange the smartphone comes with hands-free Alexa integration . That might sound like a good deal – it 's an AI assistant that many people use – but this means the phone also comes pre-loaded with all of Amazon 's apps , like Audible , Amazon Shopping , Amazon Prime Video , and Amazon Music . When a phone comes with loads of pre-loaded apps , it 's known as bloatware , as often these are applications the user is n't interested in , and has to delete individually ( if that 's even an option ) . However , if you 're an Amazon Prime member you 're probably an avid user of at least some of these apps , so they wo n't irritate you too much , and the reduced Xperia 1 could be a great deal . This is the first time we 've seen Amazon force Alexa onto a device which does n't bear its own name , but it 's something we could see more off in the future . While several Motorola smartphones have been Amazon-exclusive , like the Moto G7 , we 've heard that the rumored Motorola One Zoom will not only be only available on Amazon , but will come with Alexa integration , like the newer Xperia 1 . Presumably , it 'll have Amazon 's apps on it too . Then , there 's the rumored Fitbit Versa 2 , which supposedly has Alexa integration , and can also control your home appliances , like an Echo Show . While Amazon has had its hand in the hardware game thanks to its Amazon Kindle ereaders and Amazon Fire tablets , it 's new for the brand to put its software on other manufacturers ' devices .

Ever bought something from Amazon ? The online retailer has countless warehouses around the world , all packed to the brim with gadgets , smart speakers , home goods , books , and near anything else you could have thought to buy . But when something goes unsold for long enough , what happens then ? Apparently , it went to the dump – until now . Amazon has now announced a new community initiative program , which will kick off in the US and UK , donating hundreds of thousands of unwanted products from third-party sellers which otherwise would go to waste . Marketplace vendors will be able to donate to the likes of `` Newlife , Salvation Army , and Barnardo ’ s '' in the UK , or Good360 in the US . Products have tended to be thrown away when they 're simply stocked in excess – or suffer from too many returns – and the original manufacturer has nowhere for them to go . It 's still startlingly cheap to ask Amazon to dispose of a product – only $ 0.15 ( around £0.12 / AU $ 0.22 ) – but Amazon has made it far easier for those items to find people who can make use of them . The Fulfilled by Amazon initiative ( or 'FBA ' for short ) will start on September 1 , with the likelihood being that it will roll out beyond the US and UK sometime after that point . Given the amount of waste Amazon has been guilty of – throwing away three million televisions in 2018 alone – it ca n't come soon enough . Via The Verge

Like a hungry wolf , Amazon 's image recognition software is now able to detect fear ( plus seven other emotions ) in humans . Amazon claims that the system , Rekognition , could already spot people who were happy , sad , angry , surprised , disgusted , calm or confused . It can also accurately identify a person 's age range and gender , and works with both video and still images . `` Today , we are launching accuracy and functionality improvements to our face analysis features , '' the company said in a blog post . `` Face analysis generates metadata about detected faces in the form of gender , age range , emotions , attributes such as ‘ Smile ’ , face pose , face image quality and face landmarks . '' There are plenty of reasons why detecting a person 's emotions might be useful . It could tell an advertiser how a person is reacting to a product , enable medical professionals to help patients who are non-verbal , or ( in theory ) help law enforcement spot people who are acting suspiciously in public . This last application is the most controversial as it can lead to false alarms , which is why San Francisco has chosen to ban police from using facial recognition in the city . Not everywhere is so hesitant , though . UK police forces are trialling real-time facial recognition for identifying risks at crowded events such as music festivals , and a property company in London has recently admitted to using the technology `` in the interest of public safety '' to widespread alarm . Rekognition might now be more accurate , but Amazon has its work cut out making facial recognition palatable in public spaces . Via IT Pro
It looks like Motorola is set to release another high-end smartphone – well , high-end in Moto terms , so still a mid-ranger – as details have leaked about the Motorola One Zoom , a device we 'd heard scant information about up until now . This information comes courtesy of tech leaker Roland Quandt , who has a fairly solid track record with phones scoops – it 's not clear where he got the information though , and while many are attributing it to a leak from Amazon itself , Quandt 's tweet does n't suggest this . The confusion may lie with the fact that the Motorola One Zoom seems exclusive to Amazon , like the Moto G7 was , thanks to its integration with Amazon 's Alexa . According to Quandt the handset will work with Amazon 's AI assistant like the Echo home speakers , and this means it probably wo n't be running on Android One , the pared-down Android operating system that previous Motorola One phones ran , as Android One lacks much in the way of extra features and bloat . In terms of specs , the One Zoom apparently uses the mid-range Snapdragon 675 chipset , with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage . Motorola One Zoom ( not Pro ) with light-up Moto logo on rear , special Alexa integration ( aka not an Android One phone ) and that massive 48MP quad cam dual OIS array on rear . pic.twitter.com/DChaB9APNAAugust 13 , 2019 The reason we say the phone is premium , at least by Motorola standards , is that according to the leak ( and images alongside the leak ) the One Zoom is set to have a whopping four rear cameras . The main sensor is said to be 48MP with optical image stabilization ( OIS ) , but there 's no information on the other cameras yet . It 's probable that one of these is an ultra-wide angle lens , and another is a telephoto for zoomed-in shots , as these seem standard on most phones with at least three cameras . Plus , the 'Zoom ' in the name suggests a telephoto lens . It does n't seem like the four cameras have identical specs , like the Nokia 9 PureView , as in the images we can see the sensors are different sizes . The bottom-left sensor , which is rather small , could be a depth sensor or macro lens , which are typically used to add appropriate background blur to portrait shots , or take high-quality close-up pictures . According to Quandt , you 'll be paying €399 ( about $ 445 , £370 , AU $ 660 ) , which is rather high for a Motorola device , but affordable in the grand scheme of things – and just about the lowest price we 've seen for a quad-camera smartphone yet . For now we do n't know that much about the Motorola One Zoom , and what we do know is leaked information ( which does n't always turn out to be true , even from the most established leakers ) . When there is more to know , though , you 'll hear it first from TechRadar .

Alexa is getting some much-welcome flexibility to help users who are n't digging the smart assistants automatic talking speed , after an update that gives Alexa three different speeds when responding to voice commands . Users can now ask Alexa to `` speak faster '' or `` speak slower '' , while asking the voice assistant to `` speak at default speed '' will bring it back to the default setting . It looks like the feature has only gone live in the US so far – as we could n't get a UK-based Alexa smart speaker to recreate it . Knowing Amazon 's usual update schedule , though , we expect to the feature to roll out to the UK and beyond in the coming months . While smart home gadgets these days can be wonderfully convenient , allowing you to switch devices on and off , change room lighting , and throw voice messages all over the house – they can also be a right hassle . Not all smart home devices are compatible , after all , and setup often does n't work as seamlessly as it should – even for the tech-savvy . But one of the most promising things about the likes of Google Home and the Amazon Echo ranges is their accessibility . Voice commands do n't require any complicated button combinations , and have provided a simple interface for millions of users to access online information or access music hands-free . Altering the talking speed is a small move , but gives those needing more time to process information – or those impatient to hear everything Alexa has to say – more control over how they interact with Amazon 's smart assistant , and that 's something to be welcomed .

Edit : Amazon has clarified that the decision to retire Dash buttons was not a result of the German court ruling , but a shift to other means of quick purchasing , and the physical Dash buttons have been replaced by virtual versions . All Amazon Dash buttons will stop working at the end of August – and that ’ s a good thing . Dash Buttons made re-ordering everyday items like toilet paper and clothes detergent so simple , you didn ’ t even need to think about it – and that ’ s partly why they failed . In January , officials in Germany ruled that the buttons didn ’ t give shoppers sufficient information about the product they were purchasing ( including current pricing ) before parting with their cash , and made them illegal . That was inconvenient for German citizens ordering Ariel Colorwaschmittel directly from their washing machines , but it makes sense . If you ’ re a regular Amazon shopper , you ’ ll know that prices on the site often fluctuate ( an effect you can see clearly with free browser extension The Camelizer , which displays price changes over time when you visit a product page ) . In its terms and conditions , Amazon reserved the right to change the prices for goods ordered through a Dash Button , and even substitute a different product entirely . Not a great experience for you , and one that could result in you paying more than you would elsewhere . For items you buy frequently ( which is what the buttons were specifically designed for ) , that could make a big difference to your finances over the course of a year . The German ruling isn ’ t the only reason Dash Buttons have fallen out of favor . The wealth of connected devices ( including many made by Amazon ) in our homes means there ’ s no shortage of other ways to purchase items than a single-purpose button glued to an appliance . Just ask Alexa to order you some kitchen towel , and it could be on your doorstep the same day ( depending on where you live ) . There ’ s still very little to get in the way of consumption . Friction isn ’ t a negative , though – as a consumer , it gives you power to choose and time to reconsider . Next time you ’ re shopping for non-essentials online , try putting them in your basket ( or bookmarking them if you frequently clear your browser cookies ) and leaving them for a week . Chances are , you ’ ll change your mind about some , if not all of them . Amazon lets you skip the cooling-off period provided by the shopping cart entirely with its tempting ‘ Buy it now ’ button . With no need to enter any payment information , it almost doesn ’ t feel like spending money at all . Lightning Deals , meanwhile , play to fear of missing out ( FOMO ) , with progress bars showing the percentage of stock sold and a timer displaying how many hours , minutes and seconds you have to grab a bargain before it disappears . Lightning Deals are also a cunning way to surface products you ’ d never normally look for , or consider buying , turning them into impulse purchases . Hmm , 24 % off a garden hose ? Well the grass has been looking a bit parched lately . A Nintendo Switch toughened glass screen protector ? Maybe I ’ m taking a risk without one of those – and a matching case . Buy it now . The increasingly inaccurately named Amazon Prime Day ( this year ’ s event spanned 48 hours ) is FOMO at its finest , encouraging shoppers to wait until midnight for a Jeff Bezos-shaped Santa to drop down the chimney with a sack full of discounted electronics and dog DNA tests . There are some great deals to be found , but there ’ s a lot of chaff as well . Seamless shopping is here to stay , but the failure of Dash Buttons have shown that there is a limit to how frictionless shopping can actually be , and perhaps help us make more conscious , mindful decisions .
Amazon 's Dash Buttons will officially cease to function by August 31 , following their discontinuation in February this year . The news may come as a surprise to loyal Dash users , who were assured by Amazon that it would continue to service the self-adhesive controls as long as customers continued to buy products through them . Launched in 2015 , the Dash Button was intended to be placed somewhere convenient inside your home , so that you could re-order items from Amazon with a single press . This allowed time-pressed customers to order everything from laundry detergent to macaroni cheese , with Amazon charging their accounts and dispatching the items as soon as possible . As the Dash Button does n't give you any indication of price when you place your order , Amazon has been criticized for the time-saving devices ; after all , Amazon 's prices fluctuate all the time , and using the Dash Button means you do n't have the opportunity to shop around for a better price . In fact , German courts ruled that the devices violated the country 's consumer protection laws , earlier this year . The demise of the Dash Button could also be attributed to the rise of smart speakers and connected devices in the home , including Amazon 's own Echo smart speakers . Speakers like the Amazon Echo , Echo Plus , and Echo Dot have made it possible for Amazon customers to order products simply by asking Alexa , somewhat negating the usefulness of the Dash Button . Of course , for some , the convenience of simply pressing a button every time you run out of cat food ca n't be beaten , even by the smarts of voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant . If you count yourself among those hangers-on , you 've got a little under a month to make the most of your Dash Button . Via Android Community

The practice of having human beings review digital assistant recordings for quality control purposes is back in the news , and following Apple 's pausing of the process , Amazon has also decided to let users opt out of the reviews . Bloomberg reports on the change in policy that happened on Friday , which will see the Alexa privacy settings tweaked in the apps for Android and iOS , so you can opt out if you want to . `` We take customer privacy seriously and continuously review our practices and procedures , '' Amazon told Bloomberg . `` We 'll also be updating information we provide to customers to make our practices more clear . '' Like Apple and Google , Amazon says only a small portion of Alexa recordings are reviewed by its team , though information like users ' first names and their locations do come attached to some of the audio clips . A few days ago Google stopped the practice of having human beings transcribe recordings from the Google Assistant – at least in the EU , where the tech giant is currently under investigation from regulators . In Google 's case , part of the reason for the manual review is to improve the detection of different languages , it says . No personal user data is attached to the audio clips , apparently . Even if the quality control reviews use a small fraction of all recordings , and anonymize them along the way , most users will probably still want the choice to decide whether or not their clips get used in this way . Both Google and Amazon offer you the option to delete recordings that have been saved up from their servers . That 's not yet the case with Apple and Siri – though Apple does n't keep any recordings that are n't being reviewed anyway . Via Engadget

Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe is a new Amazon subscription service that will deliver you a package of curated clothing and accessories every month for $ 4.99 . With up to eight new garments arriving at your door each month , that 's 96 new items of clothing every year . This is n't just fast fashion – it 's supersonic . It 's easy to see why Amazon has done it , though . Market research company Mintel has found that 39 % of people in the UK use Amazon Prime ( 26 % have their own subscription , and the remainder share someone else 's ) . That 's a colossal audience who could be persuaded to sign up for Personal Shopper with just a few clicks . The release date is no accident either . It 's now a few weeks after the giddiness of Amazon Prime Day , when thousands of people signed up for Prime ( or at least a free trial ) to make the most of 48 hours of special offers . Those trial periods are almost up , Amazon has created a tempting new feature to keep subscribers from hitting the 'Unsubscribe ' button . Prime Wardrobe subscribers in the US will pay $ 4.99 ( about £4 , AU $ 7 ) a month to have their boxes of goodies curated , but what about the environmental cost ? Fast fashion ( and eight items a month is pretty speedy ) is a major source of pollution . Textile dying pollutes waterways with a cocktail of chorinated solvents and toxic colorants , and uses a colossal amount of water . Cotton-growing is also a water-hungry process that often involves pesticides . It damages marine ecosystems and depletes soil . Synthetic materials are n't great either ; they break down a little with each wash , releasing microplastics that pass through water treatment plants and make their way into soil , oceans , fish , animals , and even us . When clothing is no longer wanted , most of it ends up in landfill , where even natural fibers wo n't decompose easily due to the anaerobic conditions . A BBC documentary from last year , The Secret Life of Landfills , discovered cotton clothing from the 1980s , still fully intact . Man-made materials will take even longer – years , if not decades . A service that positions fashion as consumable and disposable makes fantastic business sense , but for the environment , the cost is just too high .
Amazon has launched a new fashion subscription service called Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe that sends you a curated box of clothing each month . Unlike Amazon 's other recommendations , your monthly fashion box wo n't be curated by algorithms or based on your past purchases ( a relief for anyone who enjoys spy novels but does n't want a trench coat ) . Instead , you 'll complete a survey and the results will be sent to a 'stylist team ' , who will pick out garments and accessories based on your responses . Everything you 're sent should fit your measurements , suit your style preferences and be within a set price bracket . It wo n't be a surprise box either ; you 'll be able to preview the items before they 're shipped and swap out any you do n't like . You can receive up to eight garments per month , but you can choose fewer if you prefer . Clothing subscriptions are nothing new ( companies like Thread and Stitch Fix have offered them for years ) but Amazon has a huge advantage thanks to all the customers who have already provided their delivery address and payment details , and trust the company 's name . The service is currently only available for women ( with a men 's version in the pipeline ) and costs $ 4.99 ( about £4 , AU $ 7 ) per month , not including the price of the clothes themselves . It seems to be US-only for the time being , but we expect it will roll out to fashionistas in other territories before long . Via The Verge

Amazon ’ s deep pockets mean that once it gets behind a product category – usually one that will lock customers into its ecosystem and encourage it to buy more things from Amazon – it tends to give it enough backing until it gains traction with consumers . It launched the Kindle at a time when e-readers were in their infancy and backed it until the concept of eBooks was firmly entrenched in the minds of consumers . The Amazon Echo helped popularise smart speakers and got Alexa – and Amazon – into people ’ s homes . Meanwhile Amazon Prime has developed from a speedy delivery service into an all-encompassing entertainment package . The next stage of Amazon ’ s development is the smart home and the announcement of Sidewalk is a significant development for the consumer Internet of Things ( IoT ) market . A number of wireless standards are used to connect IoT devices , each of which have their own advantages and disadvantages . Bluetooth offers high bandwidth but limited range , Wi-Fi promises low power consumption and high capacity but coverage isn ’ t universal , while 5G will include provisions for IoT – once network deployments are complete . Sidewalk uses unlicensed spectrum in the 900MHz band ( reserved for amateur radio transmissions ) to deliver low bandwidth and long-distance connectivity . It has a range of between 500 metres to one mile , making it ideal for devices that require low-cost and low-power transfers of small amounts of data The standard is also secure , meaning developers can issue over-the-air updates and devices have more protection . “ One of the things we learned from the Alexa Connect Kit is that developers are always looking for new ways to invent for their customers , and that includes pushing the boundaries outside the home , ” said Amazon during the unveiling . “ Bluetooth has limited range . Wi-Fi only goes so far . And 5G cellular is incredibly important when you need reliable , long distance , guaranteed delivery of data , but it can be complex . ” Another key difference is that Sidewalk is based on mesh networking technology . This means the more devices that support Sidewalk are switched on , the stronger the network becomes . Amazon also uses mesh technology in its Eero Wi-Fi system . Mesh networking also eliminates the need for widespread infrastructure deployment associated with wireless and cellular networks . To illustrate its point , Amazon said it sent 700 Sidewalk devices to Ring employees and their friends and family . Within three weeks , the entire of Los Angeles was covered . Amazon ’ s vision is one that sees Sidewalk sensors around the home informing people of what ’ s going on around them . The first product is a reference design in the form of the Ring Fetch – a connected dog collar that uses Sidewalk to track a pet ’ s location within a geofenced area . Other Ring products will likely become connected in the future , and its clear that Amazon wants the development community on board – just as they have been in creating Alexa devices and skills . “ We think developers will build all kinds of useful , low-cost products for this network , ” said Amazon . “ We started with the obvious use case of lighting with Ring 's smart lighting , but think about all the things that are far from your home Wi-Fi that might use Sidewalk—weather stations to tell you how much rain you ’ ve gotten , a water sensor in your garden with your tomatoes , a little sensor in your mailbox that lets you know when the mail has been delivered . The possibilities are endless . ” If Amazon is able to create city-wide IoT networks with relatively few access points , then the appeal of Sidewalk to developers eager to attract as wide an audience as possible is obvious . Not to mention the fact that all of this ties into the wider Alexa ecosystem . However it is very early days for Sidewalk and the ubiquity of Bluetooth , cellular , and Wi-Fi will be difficult to challenge – even if that is Amazon ’ s aim . Low Power Wide Area ( LPWA ) standards such as Narrowband IoT ( NB-IoT ) , Long Term Evolution for Machines ( LTE-M ) , LoRa and Sigfox have significant developer and manufacturer report and coverage is expanding . Meanwhile , the high capacity and low latency of 5G and Wi-Fi 6 networks will also be critical for the Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT ) . Amazon Sidewalk is unlikely to challenge the status quo ( at least for now ) , but as the company seeks to strengthen its relationship with its customer base and continue its advance from mobile devices and online into the home , then Sidewalk could be a huge feather in Amazon ’ s bow .
Amazon has launched its own wireless network system in an attempt to make connecting up your multiple smart devices easier than ever before . Amazon Sidewalk is a new low-energy network protocol using the 900Mhz wave to allow devices around your home to speak to each other . The company says that Sidewalk can even be used outside of the home as part of its bid to support the growth of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) . “ People don ’ t even realise yet how important that intermediate range is going to be , for things like lights in your yard , controlling your lights on your sidewalk in the street , ” Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said at the company 's launch event this week . Amazon is looking to position Sidewalk as an alternative to traditional Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks , allowing users with multiple devices from the company to get set up quickly . The company hopes that Sidewalk will allow for greater security and stability for your connections , but also be less of a battery drain than current Wi-Fi connections thanks to requiring lower amounts of power . Amazon showed off one use case for Sidewalk that uses a tracking collar to allow pet owners to track a runaway cat or dog by watching where it connects to devices on the Sidewalk network . Sidewalk will also allow other user 's enabled devices to mesh in seamlessly , so if you have visitors who want to play their own music or movies on your network , it should prove an end to complex set-up procedure . The company says that it also plans to publish the network protocol for Sidewalk , allowing third-party developers to utilise it for new offerings . It 's not clear how Sidewalk will work with Amazon 's own Eero mesh Wi-Fi router , but the company unveiled a new and upgraded version of its system yesterday as well , offering a much cheaper price and easier setup than its first model .

The new Amazon Echo Dot with Clock is the smart speaker I want in my tiny New York City apartment . It 's small , yet stylish , packs decent sound , has Alexa built-in , and now it shines an LED clock through the fabric sides . It remains affordable , too , except ... I 'm certain it 'll be cheaper for Black Friday 2019 . I 've become so conditioned to Amazon Black Friday sales , when Amazon slashes the retail prices of its Echo speakers . In fact , its entire range of Amazon-branded tech and appliances typically see price drops from mid-November to early December . That 's made buying newly announced Amazon gadgets difficult at launch . Outside of seasons like Amazon Prime Day and Cyber Monday , I 've become less inclined to make purchases – big or small . Even the small ones add up when I buy so much tech . Black Friday 2019 is November 29 this year , and the date for Cyber Monday is later than usual : December 2 . But it 's all still just two months away from today . The fact is , I 've become conditioned to shop on Amazon for its big tech products just two times a year . You 're never very far from Prime Day or Black Friday when you think about it . Prime Day 2019 was two months ago . The longest stretch is seven months between January and July . In effect , Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has created a Pavlovian mindset for habitual online deal seekers like myself . I 'm not sure if that 's good or bad for the Seattle-based company or society at large , but I know I 'm going to be paying less for smart home tech I use myself ( and gift to my friends and family ) . As tempted as I am to get my apartment up to speed with the latest Echo Dot ( I do n't have one ... yet ) , I 'm going to set my non-Alexa alarm clock to November 29 . There 's no certainty it will see a discount , but , while I 'm not a gambling man , I 'm betting it will drop in price . All my chips are on Black Friday .

Today , at Amazon 's 2019 product event , the company launched a boatload of new Alexa-enabled Echo products , two of which you 'll be wearing 24/7 . While the new Echo Buds are a wearable response to Apple AirPods , Amazon has gotten even more ambitious with its wearables . The company also introduced a ring and pair of glass frames , both of which have Alexa built in . These two new products are part of Amazon 's Day 1 Editions program , which aims to put new , ambitious products on the market quickly . The products will be available to customers through invitation only , and Amazon will seek feedback from users . This blends the line between customer and tester . The Echo Loop is Amazon 's smart ring . It has a titanium frame that houses two microphones , a tiny speaker , and a piezo haptic driver to provide vibrations . Given all the hardware pack inside , Amazon plans for it to be a highly capable device and not just an Alexa trigger . A small button on the bottom of the Echo Loop activates it , so it can be used to interact with Alexa . But , you can also use it for phone calls and to receive notifications from your phone . The ring will have an all-day battery life and charge fully in 90 minutes . That 's all well and good , but a simple button on a ring may prove to be the ultimate tool for placing accidental phone calls . And , that 's only if it works . In the on-stage demonstration , the button failed to work . The Echo Loop will cost $ 129 ( no international pricing has been announced yet ) and will come in four sizes . But , that is a special price for the invitation period . The Echo Frames are similar in idea but different in form : They , too , will have speakers and microphones built in , allowing you to interact with Alexa as usual . They also can discreetly play podcasts , deliver phone notifications and more using beam-forming speakers . A touch-sensitive section on the frame near your temple activates the glasses . The Echo Frames weigh 31 grams , and they can fit prescription lenses . They 'll cost $ 179 during the invitation period , but again , no international pricing has been announced . The good/bad news ? Despite being considered 'smart glasses ' they wo n't have any cameras to draw out the ire of your fellow humans like Google Glass did .
Amazon Echo speakers may be among the most popular smart speakers in the world , with the power of voice assistant Alexa 's smarts combined with low price points . However , they 've never been known for having audiophile-grade sound quality , and even Amazon 's flagship model , the Amazon Echo , is lacking in this department . No doubt the tech giant is hoping that 's all about to change , with the launch of two audio-focused Echo speakers : the upgraded Amazon Echo ( 2019 ) , and the all-new Amazon Echo Studio . The new Amazon Echo now boasts the `` the same audio architecture as the Echo Plus '' , which is admittedly , the best-sounding Echo speaker currently available . That means the Alexa-powered speaker now comes with neodymium drivers , a 3-inch woofer and increased back volume , which should make the bass feel stronger , while giving clarity to the mid and high frequencies . With no support for Hi-Res Audio , the upgraded Echo is unlikely to appeal to audiophiles , despite its new drivers and more powerful bass frequencies . Amazon just does n't have the long audio heritage of brands like Sonos and Bowers & Wilkins , whose speakers walk the fine line between consumer-friendly prices and high-end audio prowess . That does n't mean it 's all over for Amazon ; in fact , the new Echo Studio could be the first Echo speaker to truly appeals to audiophiles , being the first smart speaker to support Dolby Atmos ' virtual 3D audio . With a 5.25-inch woofer , and 330W of power , the Echo Studio promises to produce `` deep , rich bass '' , according to Amazon . It 's not just about the bass , though ; a one-inch tweeter and three two-inch mid-range speakers are designed to deliver crisp and dynamic high frequencies . That sound is customizable , thanks to in-built microphones that `` sense the acoustics '' of your room , allowing the speaker to fine-tune its audio output so that it sounds good , no matter where in the room you decide to put it . In a bid to appeal to audiophiles , the Echo Studio boasts a `` 24-bit DAC and a power amplifier with 100 kHz of bandwidth for high-res , lossless music playback '' – which of course , is now available via Amazon Music Unlimited 's new Hi-Res Audio streaming tier , Amazon Music HD . So , even if the upgraded Amazon Echo ca n't give audiophiles what they need from a speaker , the Echo Studio could just succeed where it 's smaller sibling has failed in the past – and that could be a problem for the big audio brands .
Amazon has announced its first foray into the world of true-wireless audio , with the launch of the Amazon Echo Buds at its annual hardware showcase in Seattle . The new true wireless earbuds could pose a challenge for Apple – after all , its own buds , the Apple AirPods , are the current market leaders . Based on rumors , we had expected biometric sensors to come to the Echo Buds , but it looks like Amazon has focused on audio fidelity rather than fitness tracking ; each earbud has `` two premium , balanced armature drivers , inspired by those used by professional musicians '' , according to the company . They also come with noise cancelation courtesy of Bose , specifically its Active Noise Reduction technology . This can be controlled using the touch-sensitive housings on the outside of each earbud – Amazon says that , `` with a double tap , you can turn on and off the noise reduction for pass through mode if you want to clearly hear the world around you '' . You can also tap and hold to access your device 's voice assistant – and that 's even if you use Google Assistant or Apple 's Siri , which is an interesting move from Amazon , considering its own voice assistant , Alexa , comes built into the Echo Buds . Like the Apple AirPods , the Echo buds come with five hours of battery life , with a further 20 hours provided by the charging case . They 're slightly cheaper than Apple 's earbuds though , coming in at $ 129.99 . This works out at around £105 / AU $ 190 , but we 're still waiting on global pricing and availability . Amazon says the Echo Buds are available to preorder in the US from today , and will ship `` in time for the holidays '' .
Amazon has unveiled a new and upgraded version of its Eero mesh Wi-Fi router system , at a much cheaper price than its first model , and offering even easier setup . The Eero base station is available right now in the US at the time of writing for just $ 99 / £99 / €99 ) , while a three-pack containing the base station and two beacons for expanded coverage is priced at $ 249 / £249 / €279 . A launch in France , Germany , Italy , Spain and the UK is coming this November . The new router was unveiled at Amazon 's product launch event at its Seattle , Washington headquarters , Considering that the first Eero mesh Wi-Fi set cost a whopping $ 399 ( about £300 , AU $ 530 ) , this is a dramatic price cut – and notably , it undercuts the Google Wifi three-pack by $ 10 in the US at the time of writing . Like other Eero products before it , these come with dual-band radios as well as Eero 's 'TrueMesh ' technology , which promises to eliminate dead spots in your Wi-Fi coverage . Better yet , a three-pack can now cover up to 5,000 square feet with Wi-Fi signal , a 66 % improvement over the previous model . Amazon is also introducing two new security services with these new routers , Eero Secure and Eero Secure+ , designed to safeguard the devices that connect to your network . The company has n't yet revealed the specific features of each service at the time of writing , only that Secure+ offers on-the-go protections and control . The company was much more excited to talk about how Alexa has been updated to offer voice-based Wi-Fi controls through Eero devices . Here are some of the commands you can expect : Amazon promises to make these Alexa features available to a number of routers from other manufacturers in the future , particularly Asus and TP-Link routers later this year , with support for Arris and Linksys devices coming early next year . Now that it 's available for less than Google Wifi , Amazon just made Eero a much more interesting proposition for a vast majority of would-be customers , especially given the addition of voice control . Whether this will spark a Wi-Fi war between Amazon and Google is yet to be seen , but we 'd be willing to bet on it .
Your favorite smart home devices are going to get an upgrade this year - Amazon has just announced five new Echo speakers for 2019 , including a Hi-Fi speaker called the Echo Studio , a new Amazon Echo Dot with an LED display and a wall plug Echo called the Echo Flex . While details are still pouring in about the new members of the Echo family , we 've done our best to round-up everything we know so far about the speakers and displays , along with pricing and release dates . Amazon has upgraded its most popular smart speaker , the Amazon Echo Dot , to include an LED display that tells you the time . The Amazon Echo Dot with Clock can also display things `` like the temperature or alarm times '' , according to the company , which announced the new model at its 2019 hardware showcase in Seattle . In a bid to bring Alexa into the bedroom , Amazon says that `` if used as an alarm clock , you can simply tap [ it ] to snooze your alarm for a few more minutes of sleep '' . Available for preorder today , the Alexa-powered smart speaker will cost $ 59.99 / £59.99 , which converts to around AU $ 90 . Meanwhile , the Amazon Echo has been gifted an all-new sound system , which will hopefully improve upon the somewhat lacking audio performance of its predecessor . The new Amazon Echo ( 2019 ) now boasts `` the same audio architecture as Echo Plus , including neodymium drivers , 3-inch woofer and increased back volume so the bass feels stronger , and the mids and highs are clearer '' , according to Amazon . Aside from looking a little chunkier , the Amazon Echo ( 2019 ) does n't look particularly different from the previous Echo model , still sporting that wraparound fabric grille – however , it will come in a new color , which Amazon has dubbed 'Twilight Blue ' . The new Echo is available to preorder now in the US , and will cost $ 99.99 / £89.99 ( AU $ 150 ) . There 's a new kid on the block , too : the Amazon Echo Studio , which the company says is `` the most innovative speaker we ’ ve ever built '' . According to Amazon , its the `` first smart speaker that brings 3D audio from Dolby Atmos right into your living room '' – whether the Studio will deliver true Dolby Atmos surround sound , or will provide an approximation of it , is unclear at this stage . The new smart speaker uses `` built-in Alexa microphones '' to `` automatically calibrate and model the room around you '' – so , it should sound fantastic no matter where you have it in the home . The Amazon Echo Studio will set you back $ 199.99 / £189.99 making it $ 100 more expensive than the new Echo – that works out at around AU $ 295 based on current conversion rates . We already have the Echo Show and the diminutive Echo Show 5 – now Amazon has announced a smart display that sits firmly in the middle of the two , the Amazon Echo Show 8 . With a ( you guessed it ) eight-inch HD display , Amazon says the new smart display combines the `` crisp , powerful audio '' of the 10-inch Echo Show , with the `` camera shutter and sleek form factor '' of the 5-inch Echo Show 5 . It 's available to preorder today for $ 129.99 / £119.99 – again , we 're still waiting for global pricing and availability , but that works out at around AU $ 190 . Last but not least , if the Amazon Echo Dot with a screen is still too much of a financial commitment for you but you still want Alexa in your home , check out the Amazon Echo Flex . The Flex is basically a two-way microphone that plugs into any outlet in your home . It 's not going to play music , but it can tell you the score of your favorite team when it 's playing , control smart devices in your home and answer general inquiries . In addition to the micro-microphone , the Echo Flex also has a built-in USB port so you can easily charge your phone from it . It 's only $ 24.99 / £24.99 at launch , which is around AU $ 37 .
Alexa is getting two new voice commands that will give you more control over your privacy . At its device launch event in Seattle , Washington , Amazon announced that it 's adding two new voice commands to its virtual assistant : `` Alexa , tell me what you just heard , '' and `` Alexa , why did you do that ? '' This could be eye-opening for anyone who wonders exactly how sensitive their Amazon Echo device is , or what prompted it to perform an unexpected task like playing a piece of music . Amazon says the 'what ' command will be available immediately , with the 'why ' option arriving later this year . Privacy has been a big talking point for Amazon in 2019 . Earlier in the year it added voice commands that let you delete the last thing you said , or everything you 've said during the whole day , and you 'll soon be able to have all your data deleted automatically if you opt in . Amazon promises that users will also be able to choose their individual privacy settings `` with fine granularity '' . This focus on privacy comes as no surprise ; Amazon ( along with Google and Apple ) is one of the tech giants that 's come under fire in recent months for their use – or misuse – of customers ' recorded voice commands . All three companies employed human transcribers to listen to recorded snippets and transcribe them to improve the accuracy of their software , but it was felt that users were n't made sufficiently aware that other people may be listening to what they say in the their own homes . The ability to find out exactly how much your smart speaker can hear , and decide how that information is used , is a welcome addition , and the extra transparency should go some way towards restoring users ' confidence in Alexa .
Is there a smart device for every room of your home ? Amazon and Lenovo sure hope so . Despite the worries about having always-listening devices sat in your bedroom , both companies have built gadgets for that specific location – the Amazon Echo Show 5 and Lenovo Smart Clock are headed to your boudoir . Yes , Amazon already has the Echo Spot for this purpose and , yes , you could just as easily place these gadgets in other rooms around the home . The Google Home Hub , likewise , is a similar proposition . But one look at their diminutive designs , and it ’ s clear that they ’ re best situated in the comfy confines of your bedroom . So – two different products , two similar designs and purposes , but two distinct voice-activated smart assistants built in . Which should you buy , the Amazon Echo Show 5 , or the Lenovo Smart Clock ? Read on to find out . [ Update : The Amazon 2019 hardware launch event was filled with new Alexa-powered gadgets – 14 of them to be precise – and we got hands-on time with several of them . Check out all the new Amazon Echo speakers , along with release dates , prices , and specs . ] A quick glance at both smart displays , and you ’ d be forgiven for thinking they part of the same product family , if not the same device . Both the Lenovo Smart Clock and Echo Show 5 have a very similar approach to industrial design . Each is broadly wedge shaped , and each has a screen roughly the size of a smartphone . The Echo Show 5 is the slightly larger of the two , with a 5.5-inch screen , while the Lenovo Smart Clock has a smaller 4-inch display . The Echo Show 5 is of a slightly higher resolution , too , coming in at 960 x 480 , while the Smart Clock is a lowly 800 x 480 . As we ’ ll discuss later , that ’ s not necessarily a problem , as both use their displays for quite different purposes . Back to the shape , and you ’ ll find some subtle differences there too . As mentioned , the Echo Show 5 appears slightly bigger , measuring 148mm x 86mm x 73 mm , with the Lenovo Smart Clock measuring 113.88mm x 79.2mm x 79.8mm . Both have a considerable border around their displays , but it ’ s the Amazon Echo Show 5 that ’ s the more industrial looking device – though both have a fabric covering ( black for the Echo Show 5 , and grey for the Smart Clock ) , Lenovo ’ s offering is a bit more delicate , with it ’ s softer color and wraparound cover . In terms of buttons and inputs , the Lenovo Smart Clock is simpler . It just has plus and minus volume buttons on top , while around the back there ’ s a power port , a mic-mute toggle , and a full-size USB 2.0 port for plugging in a charging cable for your phone . The Echo on the other hand has an array of buttons on its top edge – volume up and down , a mic / camera shut off button and even a physical shutter to cover up the device ’ s 1MP camera , used for video calling . It ’ s an extra layer of protection for the privacy-conscious . Around the rear is a powerport and a 3.5mm headphone port for hooking up the smart display to a larger speaker system as well as , curiously , a microUSB port . What this is practically for is unclear – it ’ s unlikely anyone is going to have a microUSB to microUSB ( or Lightning connection , for that matter ) cable with which to charge an external device . There ’ s potential to hook up a microUSB-compatible Ethernet adapter if your W-Fi is not up to scratch , but that ’ s more intended for enterprise users , and won ’ t be very helpful in most homes . The thing to note here is that Lenovo has intentionally stripped back the Smart Clock compared to its competition . It ’ s of the mindset that , for owners to feel comfortable having it in their more intimate rooms . Amazon on the other hand wants the Echo Show to be suitable in every room , and thus has more features , such as that camera . It ’ s been sensitive to users privacy wishes too , what with that physical shutter . From a design perspective then , it ’ s more of an aesthetic choice to be made . Personally , we ’ re going for the Lenovo device – it ’ s just a little less intrusive and softer . So , with roughly similar designs , the core choices you make here really come down to just two features : your preferred smart assistant ( Google Assistant or Alexa ) , and exactly what you want to be able to do with the screen . Let ’ s start with the smart assistants . As you ’ d expect , the Amazon Echo Show 5 uses Amazon ’ s Alexa voice-activated helper , while the Lenovo Smart Clock opts for Google Assistant . They ’ re broadly very similar – say either the “ Hey Google ” or “ Alexa… ” wake words , and both devices begin to start listening to your voice for requests they can fulfil . What they can achieve is mostly quite similar – you can pair them with your preferred music service to ask them to play songs , have them set timers , alarms and calendar reminders , place calls , ask for the news , control other compatible smart home gadgetry and more , all without lifting a finger . For more on what each can do , check out the guides below : What may skew your decision is if you already have another Amazon Echo or Google Assistant speaker , as that makes use of features such as multi-room audio playback much simpler across each individual brand . The core difference with the Echo Show 5 and the Lenovo Smart Clock then is in how they use their displays . The Lenovo Smart Clock is purposefully minimalist in what it displays on screen , often limiting itself to just the time or the Google Assistant logo in an attempt to keep your bedroom distraction free . The Echo Show 5 on the other hand is much more visually arresting , playing back videos , offering video call services , and other visual information to accompany whatever you ’ ve requested of it via voice . Which take on the use of a display your find more appealing will be a matter of taste then : some will find the Echo Show 5 intrusive while the Smart Clock slips more effortlessly into its surroundings , while others will consider the Smart Clock ’ s screen a wasted opportunity compared to the feature-rich Echo Show 5 . At the time of writing , we ’ re seeing the Lenovo Smart Clock sell at a more affordable price point than the Echo Show 5 . But Amazon ’ s product isn ’ t massively more expensive , and the relative price of both balances out given the Echo Show 5 ’ s richer feature set . Check the best current prices for your region in the chart below : This is a toughie . Though very closely related in their aims , the Amazon Echo Show 5 and Lenovo Smart Clock will prove noticeably different devices to live with . Were this a question of which device to have in any and every room of your home , we ’ d go for the Amazon Echo Show 5 every time . It ’ s just a more feature-complete device , offering more possible uses for the user . However , when it comes to the calm and private nature of a bedroom , the laid-back , stripped-back nature of the Lenovo Smart Clock becomes very appealing . It sits in the background a little more subtly , and will appeal more profoundly to those that desire privacy above all else . In the confines of a bedroom , that may prove to be the ultimate differentiator .
In the on-going war between Amazon and Google to win your smart home , the companies have released a number of products to keep you connected , entertained and now , keep you safe as well . If you want all of the above in a single device , however , your best bets are the latest Amazon Echo Show ( 2nd Gen ) and the Google Nest Hub Max , both of which have a built-in camera that allow you to keep tabs on your home while you ’ re away through their respective apps and a number of compatible streaming services . But when both devices are so similar in terms of specs and features , how do you know which one to buy ? Well , we put together a guide to help answer that very question . [ Update : The Amazon 2019 hardware launch event was filled with new Alexa-powered gadgets – 14 of them to be precise – and we got hands-on time with several of them . Check out all the new Amazon Echo speakers , along with release dates , prices , and specs . ] The reason you ’ d buy an Amazon Echo Show or Google Nest Hub Max is because they have a screen attached to it that allows you to watch videos and see visual representations of your voice requests . These displays are necessary for video chatting and allow you to watch any external smart security cams you bought to protect your house . But of the two , which has the better display ? The Google Nest Hub Max has a 10-inch HD display with a 1280x800 resolution… which is almost identical to the 10.1-inch screen with 1280x800 resolution that ’ s used on the Amazon Echo Show Gen. 2 . When no one is around the Amazon Echo Show will turn the interface completely off , while the Google Nest Hub Max dims its display to a nearly off state - not that it really makes that much of a difference either way . Which one is better ? It ’ s a tie . Both devices have a number of decent compatible streaming services - but in terms of big names , you ’ ll find a slightly better selection on the Nest Home Hub . For the Amazon Echo Show you ’ ve got the choices of Amazon Prime Video , DailyMotion and Hulu , plus you can get daily news from NBC . It ’ s possible to watch videos from YouTube on the Amazon Echo Show , but you ’ ll have to go through the built-in web browser until Amazon and Google add native YouTube support back to the service . If you ’ re bound and determined to stream content , the Nest Hub Max has a few more options . First up , the Nest Hub Max definitely supports YouTube , YouTube TV and YouTube Kids - perfect if you have little ones who are going to be using the speaker too . For the adults in the home there ’ s HBO Now and Starz support - though , you could get both of those on Amazon as long as you ’ re willing to subscribe to them through Amazon Prime Video . It ’ s also worth pointing out that the Google Nest Hub Max has Chromecast Built-in , which allows you to cast content to the screen as long as you ’ re on the same Wi-Fi network . The downside is that not every Chromecast-compatible app works with the Nest Hub Max - which means there ’ s currently no way on either device to watch Netflix . Which one is better ? Unless you ’ re only watching Amazon Prime Video and Hulu , the Nest Hub Max has a greater diversity of content thanks to native YouTube support . You can ’ t talk about visual performance without talking about how these displays sound . Again , it ’ s another close match but the Echo Show walks away as the better audio option . For reference , the Nest Hub Max uses a stereo speaker system with two 18mm 10W tweeters and one 75mm 30W woofer while the Amazon Echo Show uses much larger two-inch ( 50mm ) drivers and powerful bass radiator - though Amazon doesn ’ t disclose the latter ’ s exact measurements . In terms of real-world listening , we found the Amazon Echo Show to be a bit bass-heavy while the Nest Home Hub had a slightly better balance , despite being a bit quieter overall . Which one is better ? Depends on what you ’ re after , but in terms of sheer power , the Amazon Echo Show has it . But what can you expect in terms of streaming services ? Both services are pretty comparable in terms of the big names , but again , Google probably wins thanks to its support of YouTube - and , by extension - YouTube Music . On the Amazon Echo Show you can pick from six main music sources : Amazon Music , Spotify , Pandora , iHeartRadio , TuneIn and Vevo . Amazon Music has a pretty decent selection of music that numbers somewhere in the tens of millions and comes free to anyone with an Amazon Prime Account . If you want even more options there ’ s Amazon Music Unlimited , but most of the main hits can be found with the base service . That said , if you want to pick from the most music anywhere , you ’ ll find it on YouTube Music - a service which offers a majority of the music found on YouTube for free with ads . If you want to stick to the official sources , though , the Nest Hub Max supports Pandora , Spotify , Deezer and Google ’ s own Play Music . Which one is better ? We have to hand this to the Google Nest Hub Max . It doesn ’ t have as many streaming options , but there wasn ’ t a song we couldn ’ t find with YouTube Music . When it comes to smart home… er , smarts , these two devices employ two of the most powerful smart assistants in tech : Alexa and Google Assistant . Both are compatible with most major smart platforms and smart devices , but the biggest differences come down to Nest ( a Google sub-brand ) and Ring , which is now owned by Amazon . That said , both Ring and Nest have a similar lineup of products - both have smart cameras , doorbells , etc ... - so you can ’ t go wrong with either option . While both the Hub Max and Echo Show are compatible with most ( if not all ) of the same products , there is a small difference in how they learn new skills - Amazon has an open marketplace called the Skills Store where you can go to get new skills , while Google just tells you when its speakers can do something new . We like the former more than the latter . Which one is better ? In terms of hardware support , the Hub Max and the Echo Show are evenly matched , but the Echo Show ’ s library of skills give it a slight advantage . Being able to turn on and off lights using your voice is great , but so is being able to keep an eye on your home while you ’ re away . Thankfully , both the Echo Show and Nest Hub Max have the ability to drop in while you ’ re away , but the Nest Hub is more of a security device . Let ’ s talk through both devices . Through the Alexa app on your phone or tablet you can , at any point , drop into any one of your Amazon Echo Show devices provided they are connected to the internet . This allows you to see what ’ s happening at home at a given time , but you won ’ t get intelligent movement notifications or 30-day recordings . If you ’ re really interested in those , you ’ ll need to get a Google Nest Hub Max… with a Nest Aware subscription . The Nest Hub Max is Google ’ s crossover smart speaker / security device , and thus has a number of decent security features right out of the box . By connecting your Nest Hub Max to the Nest app , you can get a live feed of whatever room the Hub Max is in , plus video storage . Upgrading to the Nest Aware subscription gets you 30 days of stored video plus intelligent motion and voice detection , but it ’ s a decent security system right out of the box . Which one is better ? Considering that a Nest Hub Max doubles as a Nest security camera , we ’ re going to hand this one to Google . One of the nice perks of these speakers having a display is that you can use them to talk to family and friends - either from one Amazon Echo device to another or using Google Duo on the Nest Hub Max . To be honest , both video calling options are rather niche and require some work on your friend or family 's part as well . Still , if you 've got friends/family with either of these devices , it might make sense for you to get one of the same to avoid any extra hassle . The good news ? Both devices support voice over internet calling , which means you can use both to make phone calls nationally to any line inside the US , Canada and the UK for free . Which one is better ? There 's room for improvement with both devices . Let 's call this one a draw and move on . As you can see , it ’ s a pretty even match between the Amazon Echo Show and Google Nest Hub Max . They ’ re evenly matched in nearly every key area , with a few minor differences when it comes to streaming service selection , home security and their smart assistants . That said , if home security and having an unlimited song catalog are the things that matter to you , it ’ s worth going for the Google Nest Hub Max.It ’ s nearly impossible to find a song that isn ’ t on YouTube Music and the built-in Nest Cam makes watching over your home a breeze . Otherwise , if you ’ re all about Amazon Prime Video , a smart assistant with an ever-expanding skills library and very loud speakers , the Amazon Echo Show is your better option . It allows you to call up Amazon shows on demand and shop for new skills . It ’ s also crazy loud , which is great if you plan on placing it in a larger room .
You want to make your home smarter , but where do you begin ? Well , if you want to try out some smart home products but you 're worried they might not be for you - or might cost a small fortune - then the best way to try out the latest connected tech for size is by purchasing a smart speaker . Most smart speakers on the market right now are affordable , they 're fun to play with and , even if you decide you do n't want to talk to a robotic voice 24/7 , they can still work as run-of-the-mill music speakers or help you to carry out some simple tasks . What we 're saying is , there 's very little to lose . It may seem like the world is slowly filling up with smart speakers , but there are three top brands : Amazon , Google and Apple . You will find there are other smart speakers on the market not made by those three tech giants , but nearly all of them incorporate their tech into their products . For example , the Sonos One is , obviously , made by Sonos . But it has Amazon Alexa integration built-in , that 's Amazon 's AI voice assistant . For the purpose of this guide , we 'll only be taking a look at Amazon , Google and Apple products . But it 's worth bearing in mind that if you do n't find what you 're looking for here , you can cast the net a bit wider if you like . Let 's start by taking a quick look at what 's on offer . Google has a range of different sized speakers to choose from . Amazon 's Alexa-powered Echo range is the most popular and varied , helped by being forever splashed across the internet 's biggest retailer . And right now , Apple makes just one smart speaker , the HomePod . It ’ s not cheap and may not be as smart as Amazon 's Echo range during some of our testing , but it sounds divine and is the one to pick if you ’ re worried about privacy or your personal data being thrown around like casino chips . [ Update : The Amazon 2019 hardware launch event was filled with new Alexa-powered gadgets – 14 of them to be precise – and we got hands-on time with several of them . Check out all the new Amazon Echo speakers , along with release dates , prices , and specs . ] But hold up . Let 's not dive too far into what 's on offer without a quick lesson in smart speakers first . So smart speakers are a home for voice assistants . Just like Siri on your iPhone or Google Assistant on your Android , you can ( almost ) treat these assistants like a person . That means you can ask your smart speaker to play a specific song , quiz it about a bit of pop culture trivia , set an alarm , or get it to carry out tasks by 'talking ' to other smart home products you have , and it will . it may be embarrassing to start talking to your phone in public , but the same social pressures do n't exist in the home where you can be as weird as you like with your new robot pal . So which one should you buy ? Here 's the lowdown on what the three big tech giants have to offer . Let 's find out which is right for you . How big a speaker do you want ? Google and Amazon offer plenty of choices . Small , affordable , puck-shaped speakers like the Home Mini and Echo Dot let you try out digital assistants without spending too much . But you wouldn ’ t use them as a hifi because the sound quality just is n't up to scratch in such a small form factor . £49.99 / $ 49.99 It ’ s small , it ’ s affordable and kinda cute . The recently revamped 3rd generation version of the Dot has a small , fabric design that 's bound to fit in in any home . It also has easy set-up and integration , as well as great call quality . It does n't have good audio , but it 's a great place to start - especially if you have limited room and limited budget . $ 99.99 / £89.99 As ever , Amazon has nailed the mass-market angle with the Echo . It ’ s significantly cheaper than the Home or HomePod . Sound quality doesn ’ t match the best , but it does make podcasts and music radically more enjoyable than the Dot . $ 119 ( UK TBC ) The Fire TV Cube is Amazon 's latest branching-out of smart speaker tech . This is a smart speaker , but also a set-top box . And as it has an IR blaster it 'll turn your TV on and off too . If you care about movies more than music , this could be the right digital assistant speaker for you . $ 149.99 / £139.99 Taller than the standard Echo , this more expensive model also sounds better . It also has a Zigbee interface built-in , letting it work better with some smart home gear including Philips Hue lights . $ 129.99 / £99.99 This is what we imagined a smart home interface might look like years ago . It ’ s a digital porthole with a 2.5in screen . The Spot is a good fit for a bedside table . $ 229 / £199.99 There ’ s a much bigger screen-equipped assistant too , the Show . It ’ s not cute like the Spot , but has a much larger 7-inch screen . You can video chat with people using the front camera . It suits the kitchen , or perhaps a house 's entry hallway . $ 49 / £39 Probably the best-looking small smart speaker , the Home Mini is the budget option from Google ’ s range . It comes in Chalk ( grey ) , charcoal and Coral ( a reddish pink ) , and sounds better than the Eco Dot . $ 129 / £129 The original Google smart speaker . Home has an unusual but stylish look and a touch surface on top to let you control volume and music playback . $ 399 The big daddy of smart speakers , the Home Max looks like a wireless hifi rather than the kind of speaker that blends into the background . That said , the look is still neutral . It ’ s only the size you need to consider . $ 349 / £319 A 360-degree grille suggests how the HomePod works . There are tweeters firing out from all sides , letting you put the speaker in the middle of a room . An LED array on top displays Siri animations , which looks neat . This is a roughly accurate look at the relative stature of all these smart speakers . The part that might surprise here is the Google Home ’ s size . It ’ s relatively small . Only two of these products really demand some planning of your rooms , the Echo Show and Google Home Max . As the others have an “ upright ” design , their footprints are n't all that large . The Echo Dot is the smallest of the lot , although the Home Mini is only slightly bigger . Which sounds the best ? There ’ s predictably a rise in quality as the size increases . However , there are some interesting points to note in each class . Let ’ s put them in bullet point form to keep this clear . When it first launched , Alexa 's functionality was fairly basic , limited to mundane conversations like asking about the weather or the time . As Amazon continued to develop the software , however , Alexa gained the ability to talk about calendars , sports and what we should have for dinner . We 're not quite living in a Star Trek-esque future , where the device will understand your every command , but Alexa is advanced enough to understand multiple phrasings of the same question , for example . Amazon has a strong track record for the past two years , sure , but it 's going up against Google , a company that 's had a strong track record in information parsing for the last two decades Google 's impressive search abilities means the speaker has a lot of information at its disposal . Google Home can , for example , correctly guess a song that 's described in the vaguest of terms . Interacting with Google Assistant has the most natural feel . It understands your commands better than Alexa . You don ’ t have to be so careful about how you word your sentences . HomePod ’ s Siri is the least intelligent of the three . While the voice recognition works , the commands it ’ ll react to successfully are quite limited . Think of HomePod as a great-sounding wireless speaker that also has some smarts and you 'll be happier . Some major software updates , however , have seen it gradually catching up to the smart functionality of the competition – meaning it can now make and receive calls via your iPhone contact book . A HomePod OS update in September is also adding new lyric search options , a way to 'ping ' your lost phone in the house , and a wider range of Siri languages . Music and Video playback Each of these speakers is linked to its maker ’ s music service . The HomePod has Apple Music . Echo devices have Amazon Music . Google Home speakers have Google Play Music . However , only Apple is truly restrictive . Echo and Home speakers let you ask for tracks from Spotify , for example , but HomePod ’ s Siri only takes requests from Apple Music . You can use Spotify with a HomePod but you ’ ll have to do this the “ old school ” way , selecting the HomePod as the source from in the Spotify app rather using voice commands . You ’ re then using AirPlay , not the voice control you paid $ 350 for . Subscribing to Apple Music is almost a must for HomePod owners , and it costs $ 9.99/£9.99 a month . While there 's some parity between which software the other smart speakers can access , video content differs much more . Only Amazon has devices equipped with screens . Google has blocked YouTube , though , so you ’ re largely restricted to Amazon Video , the Netflix-a-like service . Both Google and Amazon 's devices allow you to play content on an external TV . Google achieves this through integration with its Chromecast lineup , while Amazon has added this functionality through its Fire TV . If you have a Chromecast Audio then you can simply ask Google Home to play music through the speakers it 's connected to . Meanwhile the Echo is limited to playing music on its own speaker , and the Echo Dot can only be connected to a single speaker at a time through either Bluetooth or a wired 3.5mm connection . In theory this should give the Google Home the edge , but in practice its Google Cast functionality could be better . Once you ’ ve got it casting to a speaker it won ’ t remember that this is the case and it will default to playing music out of its own speaker unless you specifically tell it to continue to cast the next song . Google Home does however have the advantage of integrating with Chromecast for video . You can easily play shows from Netflix , YouTube and other supported apps using just your voice , however again in practice this could be better since you ’ re unable to specify particular episodes and it will default to picking up where you left off . Not bad when you ’ re marathoning a series , but less than ideal if you ’ re just dipping in . Productivity Google Home integrates with a number of Google 's other services , from planning routes using Google Maps to translating using Google Translate . It will also draw from your Google Calendar , which is a handy feature . However again , while there ’ s potential here , Google Home doesn ’ t make nearly enough use of this functionality . You can get basic directions by car on Google maps , but it can ’ t handle public transport and definitely does n't do email . Meanwhile , Amazon has an ever-growing list of compatible `` Skills '' apps including Domino 's Pizza , Just Eat in the UK and Uber , allowing you to either have your pizza delivered or request a ride over to the store to pick it up yourself . Support is good , but these apps feel like they add fun side-functionality rather than core productivity services . HomePod doesn ’ t have any third-party skills , so it ’ s limited to interactions based on your Apple calendar , local traffic and other piecemeal bits . Smart Home Of course , music and services are just two parts of the smart speaker equation . If you 're buying a Home , Echo or HomePod , you 're also looking for a smart assistant to help control the burgeoning field of smart appliances making their way into homes . In this area , Amazon 's Echo Plus has a distinct advantage . It has a Zigbee hub built in , which means that for many smart home products you no longer have to have a separate piece of hardware plugged into your router . However , this functionality comes with the caveat that functionality will be limited when using the built-in hub . Philips Hue lightbulbs , for example , can be turned on and off , but their more advanced color-changing abilities will still require a dedicated Hue hub . That said , it 's not like Google , owner of Nest , is hurting in the home automation department . Google Nest , for obvious reasons , is also integrated into Home 's functionality . As for Apple , it started its HomeKit program ages ago which means many devices are ready to go . However , there are thousands of third-party devices that will work with all three smart speakers . Amazon Alexa supports the highest number of smart home devices , but the best idea is to check whether the smart home gear you own , or are considering , supports these systems . Shopping A newer feature for both the Amazon Echo and Google Home is the ability to shop from the comfort of your couch via voice commands . Let 's start first with the more established e-tailer . Amazon offers daily and weekly specials via the `` Alexa , what are today 's deals ? '' command . When used , the speaker will rattle off a list of products available to purchase and the price of each . At any point , you can stop the speaker and say , `` Alexa , purchase < insert product name > '' and Alexa will confirm your order . If you want to see all the deals in one spot , however , you can also check out the Alexa Deals page on Amazon 's website . Because Google does n't own a massive online retail store like Amazon does , Google Home has partnered up in the US with Walmart and other retailers to offer a voice shopping catalogue of its own . It 's all part of Google 's Express platform , that allows you to quickly order products from a number of other retailers like Kohl 's , Target , CostCo , Whole Foods and Ulta . Walmart will be the biggest retailer to join Google Express 's ranks . HomePod doesn ’ t let you buy items with a voice command . Some may find this reassuring rather than an issue . However , you can ask Siri to add items to a shopping list . You can then check it on your phone when at the supermarket . Both Google Home and Amazon Echo support multiple users , which is important if you do n't want to be subjected to your other half 's calendar when you ask your speaker what you 're up to today . However , the way the two speakers handle multiple accounts is slightly different . With the Amazon Echo you 'll have to manually switch between user accounts by saying `` Alexa , switch accounts '' , or `` Alexa , switch to Jon 's profile . '' Google Home is slightly more clever , and will recognise different users by the sound of their voice alone . You 'll need to train the speaker to recognise each person 's voice by saying `` OK Google '' and `` Hey Google '' a few times , but after that point you should n't have to worry about accidentally getting traffic information for someone else in your household . HomePod doesn ’ t support multiple users yet . It ’ s linked to one iCloud account , so becomes that person ’ s speaker . And Siri will react to whoever talks to it . Again , HomePod is the most restrictive choice . Part of Siri ’ s limited smarts is down to its approach to privacy . Google and Amazon use data collection to learn about you . Apple uses a purer form of artificial intelligence , making it harder to create the illusion Siri knows what you want every time you open your mouth . Google and Amazon also log the data from any requests made and link them to your online accounts . This data can then be used to tailor the ads you see on websites , which also happens when you search for something on Google.com or amazon.com . HomePod doesn ’ t do this . Your Siri data is encrypted and randomised , and isn ’ t actually even linked to your Apple account . If privacy is a worry , the HomePod is a great choice . Compatibility You can use an Echo or Google Home speaker with any recent phone . iOS or Android ? It doesn ’ t matter , either will work fine . This isn ’ t the case with a HomePod . You have to have an iPad , iPhone or iPod Touch to get it working . Apple ’ s official line is you ’ ll need an “ iPhone 5s or later , iPad Pro , iPad ( 5th generation ) , iPad Air or later , iPad mini 2 or later , or iPod touch ( 6th generation ) running iOS 11.2.5 or later . ” If you want to try out a smart speaker without spending much , the Echo Dot and Google Home Mini are your two choices . And Google ’ s is the better-sounding of the two despite the fact the Dot has had a revamp recently to make it the best-looking . Those who want a smart speaker to act as their main hifi should consider either the Apple HomePod or Google Home Max . They sound far better than the other smart speakers . How about in-between ? The Amazon Echo ( 2nd Gen ) offers a great compromise between price and sound quality , and Amazon Alexa offers lots of smart home features to play around with thanks to its Skills system . Amazon ’ s smart speakers with screens are great for , say , the kitchen . However , they are also hugely held back by the politics involved , as you can ’ t use YouTube or Netflix on them . Make sure you adjust your expectations before buying .
Smart home enthusiasts are in thrall to Amazon . With the humble Amazon Echo having found its way into millions of homes worldwide , and expanded into a number of distinct models , it ’ s no surprise that the latest Echo to land from the retail giant – the Amazon Echo Show 5 – is already drumming up excitement . But when we compare the Amazon Echo Spot and Echo Show 5 , which will come out on top ? The launch of the Echo Show 5 later this month is set to be something of a refresh . The new screen-based Echo manages to undercut both the Echo Spot and previous Echo Show on price – Amazon ’ s other smart displays currently on sale – while still seemingly offering the latest and best of smart functionality to boot . [ Update : The Amazon 2019 hardware launch event was filled with new Alexa-powered gadgets – 14 of them to be precise – and we got hands-on time with several of them . Check out all the new Amazon Echo speakers , including the Echo Show 8 , along with release dates , prices , and specs . ] Amazon doesn ’ t always do itself favors with the complexity of its Echo range , however . With a variety of speakers and displays varying from the minimal Echo Dot to the woofer Echo Sub , there ’ s a host of shapes , sizes and functionalities on the market , with new iterations of each coming out all the time . That ’ s why we ’ ve put together this head-on comparison of the Echo Spot and Echo Show 5 , with everything you need to know about their specs , pricing , and what the Show 5 ’ s arrival means for the Echo range as a whole . We ’ ll be sure to update this guide when we get to a full review of the Show 5 , but if you ’ re unsure whether to get the Spot or wait for the new display , this guide is for you . The Echo Show 5 and Echo Spot have a lot in common at first glance . Amazon has a tendency to make slight alterations between its Echo products to see which features are most important to its audience , and its range of smart displays is no different . Both displays are screen-based smart home devices , able to play both video and audio on a compact screen . The Echo Spot has been commercially available since late 2017 , when it launched as smaller bedside alternative to the then first-generation Echo Show . Meanwhile , the Echo Show 5 is a sibling to the 2nd gen Echo Show , which came out in 2018 with a 10-inch screen . ( The ‘ 5 ’ branding refers to the new model ’ s 5.5-inch screen , much like the naming of Amazon Fire tablets ) . The Show 5 launches on June 26 , and will be available in the US , UK , Germany , France , Italy , Spain , Japan , Canada , New Zealand , and Australia – with models shipping to India in July . The main difference between the two smart displays is their size . The Echo Spot has a rounded body and 2.5-inch circular screen , making it ideal as a clock face for a bedside table . The Echo Show 5 , on the other hand , features a rectangular 5.5-inch screen with a curved back , offering a more traditionally-shaped display . Otherwise the inputs are largely the same , with both having a touchscreen display , as well as physical buttons for volume control along the upper side of the casing . Both models are available in black or white , and require a cabled power connection . They both have a Microphone / Camera Off button , allowing you to switch off any video or audio recording features when you ’ re wary of being spied on . The Show 5 , though , comes with a physical shutter to make sure there ’ s no way of being filmed by accident – or possibly just to put you at ease . The Show 5 is a clear winner for picture quality , packing in 960 x 480 pixels in its larger screen , compared to 480 x 480 for the Echo Spot . The quality of images and videos taken with the Show 5 ’ s camera is also significantly better , with a 1MP lens compared to the Spot ’ s VGA camera ( 0.3MP ) . The Show 5 also has a larger audio output , with 4W speakers over the Spot ’ s 2W equivalent , though we ’ re reserving judgement on the sound quality until we test the Show 5 for ourselves – the 2nd-gen Echo Show was a bit bass-heavy , and we ’ re hoping the new model goes for clarity of voices instead , given we ’ re likely to use it mainly for YouTube videos and calls . The main draw of the Echo ecosystem has to be the Alexa voice assistant . Though not perfect , and prone to “ trouble understanding right now ” , Alexa is still a brilliantly convenient way to navigate music playlists and radio stations , hear weather information or news , learn trivia and definitions , and a whole host of other possible functions . Both models have the same fully-fledged Alexa assistant that runs across Amazon ’ s entire Echo range – with the ability to make video calls to other Echo devices , display personal photos , and watch online videos on either model ( you can now make calls to phone numbers in the US and UK , too ) . It ’ s the larger size and resolution of the Show 5 , though , that opens the way for expanded functionality , with a new integration with wikiHow that `` allows you to access hundreds of how-to videos by voice '' for day-to-day problems like cleaning specific spills and stains , cooking certain recipes , or any other number of non-domestic queries – though the Show 5 is being angled as more of a kitchen assistant than the Spot ’ s bedroom alarm clock . It 's worth noting that neither the Echo Spot or Show 5 run the Zigbee smart home hub found on the Echo Plus or 2nd-gen Echo Show . Zigbee is essentially a smart home network standard that allows devices from different manufacturers to play nicely with each other – meaning you don ’ t need every smart gadget in your house to be made by the same manufacturer . This is less of an issue now : Alexa will work automatically with the likes of Philips Hue , Hive , or Kasa smart products – with numerous Alexa skills expanding this to Ring , among others . But if your device specifically works via Zigbee and isn ’ t one of these main brands , it might be worth checking their compatibility . Perhaps most importantly , what ’ s the difference in price ? The Echo Spot was previously the cheapest way to get an Echo smart display , costing just $ 129 / £119 / AU $ 199 . By comparison , the 2nd-gen Echo Show retails at $ 229 / £219.99 / AU $ 349 . The Show 5 , though , comes in at just $ 89.99 / £79.99 / AU $ 129 – making it by far the most affordable of the three , despite being twice the size of the Echo Spot . We would be very surprised if the Spot did n't get a price cut on the Show 5 's release – especially with Amazon Prime Day coming soon after the launch – but for now the disparity makes it hard to recommend the Spot over its new sibling . If you preorder two Echo Show 5s from Amazon , you ’ ll also get a $ 30 / £25 discount in the US and the UK respectively . Unfortunately the same deal does n't seem to be available in Australia . The Show 5 sits around the middle of the scale between the miniature Echo Spot and 2nd-gen Echo Show , but with a far more tempting price point than either . Unless you ’ re specifically hankering after the Echo Spot ’ s smaller ( cuter ? ) form factor , or the Echo Show ’ s larger 10-inch ( and high definition ) screen , the Show 5 should probably be the first port of call for a new smart display – especially as a hands-free kitchen companion . The Show 5 ’ s pre-order deal makes it a very tempting way to start your Echo family – though if you already have an Echo Spot or Show and want to upgrade , it ’ s well worth keeping the older models as well . Echo devices were made with multi-room functionality in mind , and being able to connect various Shows and Spots to a single network is a big draw of the Amazon ecosystem .
So you ’ ve decided that you want a smart speaker . You ’ ve ruled out the Apple HomePod and its sometimes-sketchy Siri voice companion , and have decided Google already knows enough about you before inviting a Google Home Hub into your castle . That pretty much leaves you with Amazon ’ s Alexa range or Echo speakers . You want something with a bit more audio oomph than the small Amazon Echo Spot , Echo Dot or forthcoming Amazon Echo Show 5 , and find the screen-sporting full-size Echo Show a bit domineering . What ’ s left ? The Amazon Echo , or the Amazon Echo Plus . They ’ re the most closely-related of the smart speakers coming out of Amazon ’ s stable , and understanding the differences between them can make choosing which is for you a surprisingly involved task . Which sounds better ? Which is more expensive ? What exactly makes the Plus ... plusier ? We ’ re here to help : these are the key differences and benefits of the two core Amazon Echo models . [ Update : The Amazon 2019 hardware launch event was filled with new Alexa-powered gadgets – 14 of them to be precise – and we got hands-on time with several of them . Check out all the new Amazon Echo speakers , along with release dates , prices , and specs . ] First things first – what exactly do these speakers do ? At their heart , both the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Echo Plus are voice-activated , web-connected speakers . By simply talking to the onboard voice assistant , Alexa , you can use your natural spoken voice to get the speaker to do things . Simply say the wake word “ Alexa ” , which the speakers ’ onboard microphones are constantly listening for , and they ’ re then ready to do your bidding . They ’ re incredibly versatile speakers , capable of carrying out many tasks , known here as 'Skills ' . Connecting to hundreds of popular services and thousands of smart home products , you can ask Alexa to play any song from your favored streaming service of choice , answer all manner of general knowledge questions , read books and playback podcasts , and control loads of web connected products around your home , from the channels on your TV to the color of your smart light bulbs . Mileage will vary depending on how much web-connected tech you ’ ve got dotted around your home , but the Amazon Echo speakers are so simple to use that even tech luddites can have one seamlessly integrate into their lives . Whether it ’ s asking for a weather report , setting alarms and timers , or noting down calendar reminders , everyone will find these smart speakers useful to some degree or other . You can now make voice calls to mobile phone numbers in the US , UK , Canada , and Mexico . To enable this feature , you need to assign your mobile number to your Amazon account , giving it access to your contacts book . You 'll then be able to ask `` Alexa , call Dad '' and have your smart speaker patch you through to her smartphone . The ability to receive calls on Echo devices is limited depending on which mobile network you 're on , but anyone is able to make them . At first glance , there ’ s really not that much to separate the Echo and the Echo Plus , now that ’ s they ’ re both a couple of hardware revisions in . Both are broadly cylindrical in shape and 5.8-inches tall , with the Echo Plus being a little plumper at 3.9-inches compared to the Echo ’ s 3.4-inch girth . Both have buttons on top for muting the mic , activating Alexa , and changing volume levels , and both have the signature blue light ring around their rims to let you know when Alexa is listening . The only difference is in the finishes – the Plus has three fabric surfaces to pick from ( sandstone , charcoal or heather gray ) , while the regular Echo has those fabric finishes as well as smooth oak , walnut and ‘ silver ’ options which expose the speaker grilles . In other words , there ’ s not a lot separating the two – go for an Echo with a smooth finish if you want a more industrial look , otherwise it ’ s just a choice of shades . Previous versions of the Plus were taller and slimmer , with a physical dial to control the volume , but these are now long discontinued . So , see those things up above that we said the Echo speakers can do ? All that will work across both Amazon Echo and Amazon Echo Plus . So they ’ re incredibly similar in terms of core functionality . Before we start talking about sound , there are just two key features that separate the two devices . The first is a simple one . The Amazon Echo has only a 3.5mm line out port , should you want to send its sounds to another sound system you may have . The Echo Plus has both line and line out , which means it can both output sound to another speaker , and receive audio information to be outputted by the Echo Plus speaker from another device over that 3.5mm connection . What really separates the Echo Plus though is its built-in Zigbee smart home hub . Many smart home devices require separate control devices that help them communicate with devices like an Amazon Echo – Philips Hue lightbulbs for instance have their own hub , requiring its own power outlet . The Echo Plus does away with this , by having its own Zigbee hub built in . Zigbee is a smart home standard that lets devices communicate with each other , and while it doesn ’ t cover every single device , it does account for a huge percentage of them . So the Echo Plus could potentially save you a lot of messing around with individual products ’ hubs . Neither the Amazon Echo or Amazon Echo Plus are audiophile grade devices . They sound great for their respective price points , but understand that they ’ re not the same quality as a dedicated stereo hi-fi . And that ’ s sort of the point – these are relatively affordable and focus on being on smart , rather than on caressing your ears with the most luxurious of audio components . They ’ re both enjoyable though . Of the two , the Amazon Echo Plus is the superior sounding device . While both offer Dolby-tuned internals for as rich a sound as their components can deliver , the Plus has the beefier drivers . It has a 3-inch woofer and 0.8-inch tweeter , while the regular Echo sticks with a 2.5-inch woofer and 0.6-inch tweeter . That said , it ’ s not a huge difference between the two . The Echo Plus definitely feels more powerful – there ’ s a depth to its sound that the standard Echo can ’ t match – but it ’ s just a step or two above , not a radical difference . We ’ d personally opt for the Echo Plus in terms of audio , but if your budget doesn ’ t stretch that far , you shouldn ’ t feel too left out . Given the more robust feature set , it ’ s the Echo Plus which , unsurprisingly costs the most out of the pair . You can find the latest live prices for both below : Is it worth the added expense ? It ’ s arguable – both are broadly similar . The Echo Plus sounds better , but not massively so , though the convenience of being able to free your home from numerous different smart home device hubs is a worthy one . Our gut leans towards the standard echo being more worthy of your money , with the Plus being a nice ‘ deluxe ’ upgrade if you ’ ve got some extra money to spend . It ’ s full of nice extras , but not necessarily ‘ must-haves ’ . It 's worth noting that both can often be found bundled with different compatible smart home devices , from doorbells to smart lightbulbs . Make sure to do the maths on any bundle deals you see – you might even make a saving overall with a Plus if its paired with something else you 're after . Taken in isolation though , both are fantastic devices , worthy of your cash . You can ’ t go far wrong whichever Amazon Echo device you opt for .
When you ’ re thinking of buying a smart speaker , choosing the right model can be really tricky ; even if you ’ ve settled on a brand , the best smart speaker brands often have a number of different models for every occasion . If you ’ ve discounted the Apple HomePod , and don ’ t fancy the speakers in the Google Home range , you might be looking to buy an Amazon Echo speaker – but how do you choose between an Amazon Echo and its smaller sibling , the Echo Dot ? Both offer the smarts of Amazon ’ s Alexa and the company ’ s now-iconic design . You can even use both speakers to place phone calls to phone numbers in the US , Canada , Mexico , and the UK , by assigning your mobile number to your Amazon account , and giving it access to your contacts book . But , which one is more expensive ? Which model is best for students and which one offers better audio quality ? We ’ ve taken an in-depth look at both smart speakers so you can make an informed decision . UPDATE : The Amazon 2019 hardware launch event was filled with new Alexa-powered gadgets – 14 of them to be precise – and we got hands-on time with several of them . Check out all the new Amazon Echo speakers , along with release dates , prices , and specs . The most important updates to note are that the Echo and Echo Dot have both had a significant refresh . The Amazon Echo has been gifted an all-new sound system , which will hopefully improve upon the somewhat lacking audio performance of its predecessor . And the Amazon Echo Dot with Clock now has an LED display that tells you the time . Smart speakers may be ubiquitous these days , but that wasn ’ t always the case . When Amazon released the Amazon Echo Dot in 2014 , the craze for connected devices and voice assistants truly took off . Now in its second generation , the Amazon Echo is still one of the best smart speakers on the market . Combining Amazon ’ s voice-enabled smart assistant Alexa with home audio , the Echo stormed the smart home market , before branching out into a number of different speakers and smart displays , including the Echo Show , Echo Plus , and Echo Dot . The Echo Dot may be the smallest Echo speaker , but it ’ s also the best-selling according to Amazon , thanks to its compact size and modest price tag . Designed to fit into any room of your home , the Echo Dot is now available in its third iteration . The Amazon Echo Dot is the cheapest of the two smart speakers , but you can currently get both the Echo and the Echo Dot at a discount from a number of retailers worldwide , making both prices more palatable than ever . At launch , the Amazon Echo cost $ 180 / £150 / around AU $ 230 , while the Echo Dot cost $ 49.99 / £49.99 / AU $ 79 . However , both speakers have seen sizable discounts since then , and you can currently get your hands on the Amazon Echo for as little as $ 83 / £69.99 / AU $ 149 and the Echo Dot for $ 30 / £30 / AU $ 48 . In Australia the Echo Dot is still being sold for AU $ 79 on Amazon , but with Amazon Prime Day fast approaching , it might be worth holding on until then to buy your new Echo speaker . With a wraparound fabric grille in stylish ’ Charcoal ’ , ‘ Heather ’ and ‘ Sandstone ’ shades , both the Amazon Echo and the Echo Dot sport a cool , minimalist design that looks great in most homes . On the top of both speakers you ’ ll find volume buttons , a button to mute the inbuilt microphones , and a button for summoning Alexa for when you don ’ t feel like calling out the voice assistant ’ s name . The most obvious difference between the Echo and the Echo Dot is the size . The cylindrical Amazon Echo ’ s measurements are 5.8 x 88 x 88mm , and it weighs 821g . The hockey puck-shaped Echo Dot on the other hand , is just 99 x 99 x 43mm , and is less than half the weight of the Echo at 300g – this means the Echo Dot is ideal for squeezing into small spaces like a bedside table , and could be ideal for those who are short on space , like students living in a shared house , for example . Both the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Echo Dot share a lot of the same features ; they ’ re both Alexa-activated , web-connected speakers that can play music as well as control your smart home . Saying the speakers ’ wake word , ‘ Alexa ’ and they are both ready to respond straight away , thanks to inbuilt microphones that are constantly listening out for your commands . The kind of tasks your Echo or Echo Dot is capable of carrying out depends largely on which Alexa ‘ skills ’ you have enabled ; Alexa skills are like tricks that your smart speaker can perform for you . There are skills for controlling your smart home gadgets , for playing music and radio , for giving you recipes step-by-step , and even ordering pizza from Dominoes . These features are available on every Amazon speaker , so in terms of smart features , the Echo and the Echo Dot are matched equally . In terms of audio quality , there ’ s a clear winner ; the Amazon Echo ’ s 65mm woofer , 15mm tweeters , and Dolby processing means it offers a more expansive sound than its smaller sibling . That ’ s not to say that the Echo Dot sounds terrible ; its sonic output means its fine for putting on some background music while you ’ re pottering around the kitchen , but you ’ re not going to get audiophile-quality sound . What the Echo Dot is great for , is for adding Alexa ’ s smarts to otherwise ‘ dumb ’ speakers . With audiophile brands like Sonos , Denon , Marantz , Onkyo , Pioneer , Yamaha , and many more offering Alexa-compatible products , you can tell your Echo Dot to play your music on a much more powerful speaker hands-free . Why not do this with the Amazon Echo ? It comes down to price ; if you ’ re going to use your Echo speaker to control other audio devices , you may as well buy the cheaper version . After all , the Amazon Echo offers better sound than the Echo Dot , but not much else . Whether you should buy an Amazon Echo or an Amazon Echo Dot largely depends on what you want to use it for . Want a voice-activated speaker that will do your music justice ? Go for the Amazon Echo . Looking for something to control your other connect gadgets ? The Echo Dot is probably your best bet . Aside from size and cost , the only real difference between the two speakers is the sound quality on offer – after all , both the Echo and the Echo Dot support the same Alexa smarts . So , if you ’ re planning on using your Echo speaker for casual background listening , or as a device to control your more powerful audiophile speakers , you should save your money and buy the cheapest option , the Echo Dot . It ’ s worth taking the size of the speakers into account too , of course ; perhaps you already have an Echo in your living room and you want to bring Alexa to your bedside table – in that case , too , it ’ s probably best to go for an Echo Dot . If you have a large room that needs filling with sound , go for the Amazon Echo , or even its larger sibling , the Echo Plus .

If you ’ re looking for a streaming device to plug into your television , you may well be eyeing up one of Amazon ’ s Fire TV range : the Fire TV Stick , Fire TV Stick 4K , or Fire TV Cube . Why would you want a streaming device ? Most televisions sold nowadays are what ’ s called ‘ smart TVs ’ , meaning they ’ ll have Wi-Fi connectivity and be able to access a huge number of apps and services for watching TV and films on demand . That means you can watch Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu and YouTube all on your television , the same way you ’ d open an app on your smartphone . But if you ’ re holding onto an older TV without those services , and don ’ t fancy paying loads for an upgrade when you could spend a fraction of the amount on a plug-in streaming stick , we ’ ve got everything you need to choose between Amazon ’ s Fire TV range in this handy guide . The European tech show IFA 2019 was a big one for Amazon with a number of new announcements . This includes the unveiling of a number of new Fire TV Edition sets , as well as a new Amazon Fire TV Cube , which is an updated version of its Alexa-enabled hands-free streaming media player , adding Dolby Vision and a few other new features to the mix . We have n't had the chance to thoroughly test the new Fire TV Cube yet , but we 'll be sure to update this article as soon as we do . The original Fire TV ( 2017 ) that started it all is sadly no more , after the smaller and more compact Fire TV Stick supplanted it . With the Fire Stick ’ s 4K upgrade , too , choosing between Fire TV devices is now as simple as picking HD or Ultra HD for your TV streaming . It ’ s a different story in the United States , which is currently the only place you can get the Amazon Fire TV Cube : basically a Fire TV streaming box built into an Amazon Echo speaker . If you ’ re outside of the US you don ’ t have the option , though if you don ’ t want – or already have – a smart speaker in your living room , this won ’ t feel as urgent a purchase anyway . How much is each Fire TV streaming device ? The regular Fire TV Stick retails at $ 39.99 / £39.99 , while the Fire TV Stick 4K is a smidge higher at $ 49.99 / £49.99 . The Fire TV Cube – bundling as it does the functionality of a streaming stick and Amazon Echo together – comes with a somewhat higher $ 119.99 price tag ( around £95 / AU $ 170 ) . On the surface , you won ’ t really be able to tell the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick 4K apart . Both come in the form of a small HDMI dongle that plugs into the back of your television . Both models also ship with the second-generation Alexa remote , meaning the navigation and voice control of the Fire TV app is identical between them . The Alexa remote comes with a hold-to-speak voice functionality , meaning you can push a button and have Alexa come up on your television . If you link up the streaming stick to an Amazon Echo , too , you can command your television to awaken and jump to specific shows or categories with voice commands , though Alexa isn ’ t quite as smart on Fire TV as she is with other daily needs . The Fire TV Cube is a whole other affair . It has the look of a boxy Amazon Echo speaker , and is designed as a hands-free interface you can control entirely through your voice – though it also comes with the 2nd-gen Alexa remote for those who don ’ t want to struggle with Alexa ’ s poor app navigation . The Fire TV Cube can act as a control center for changing channels on your set top box , altering volume , swapping inputs to your soundbar , and the like . The Cube ’ s eight far-field microphones will be able to pick up your words clearly from across the room , though the noise from a nearby TV or soundbar can make this difficult mid-watch . Probably the most important question here : what can you actually watch on the Fire TV , and how does the image quality vary between each device ? Each of these devices shares the same Fire TV platform , so you ’ re able to watch content from the same apps across all the devices – though the resolution and video format will vary . In the US , you ’ ll find Netflix , HBO , Starz , Hulu , PlayStation Vue and Crackle – with plenty of other varied apps alongside – with equivalent services like BBC iPlayer and Freeview Play replacing US-only apps in the UK . While YouTube isn ’ t yet on the platform , Amazon and Google are working at amending this for users . Remember that a lot of these services require separate subscriptions : you wo n't be able to watch Netflix shows or Amazon Prime movies for free on a streaming stick . The basic Fire TV Stick can stream content up to HD quality ( 1080p ) , but the Fire TV Stick 4K – as the name suggests – can reach 4K UHD resolution , around four times the number of pixels . The Fire TV Cube also supports 4K streaming . To stream in 4K , it ’ s worth remembering that you ’ ll need a 4K-capable television . Even if you have a 4K streaming stick , all those lovely pixels are going to be compressed to HD if that ’ s all your TV can display . That ’ s the same for HDR : the 4K stick and Fire TV Cube both support HDR10 for an expanded color gamut and enhanced contrast , but not if your TV can ’ t back them up . While the Fire TV Cube streams in 4K HDR , the 4K Stick manages to go above and beyond its more expensive counterpart by packing in support for HDR10+ and Dolby Vision . These are both ‘ dynamic metadata ’ formats , which is a fancy way of saying they vary the color , contrast , and brightness of the pictures onscreen in real-time , instead of blanket picture settings . Again , not every television supports these , so it ’ s worth checking what your TV can display before you make your choice . There are other competing streaming devices out there , all with their own interfaces and selection of apps , like the range of Roku streaming devices or Apple TV 4K . Your best bet is probably whatever ecosystem you ’ re already in : iOS devices play best with Apple TV and Amazon Echo speakers were designed to work in tandem with Fire TV . The Google Chromecast is a similarly-priced competitor , but doesn ’ t pack in the Amazon Prime Video app – and can also be frustrating to navigate . There ’ s an in-depth comparison of all the leading models in our Apple TV vs Amazon Fire TV Stick vs Roku vs Chromecast guide . Just want to skip to the verdict ? Unless you ’ re a US resident it ’ s a pretty simple equation : get the Fire TV Stick for an HD television , and the Fire TV Stick 4K for an Ultra HD television . You ’ re paying a very small premium for the uplift in picture quality , and you get all sorts of HDR improvements and HDR10+ / Dolby Vision support alongside . For those in the US , you have the option of the Fire TV Cube . This device doesn ’ t support Dolby Vision or HDR10+ , so if you ’ re looking for these video formats you ’ ll want to stick to the Fire TV 4K . Alexa also struggles with navigating the Fire TV app by itself , and we expect you ’ ll end up using the remote most of the time – meaning the hands-free functionality of the Cube isn ’ t particularly useful . If you fancy being an early adopter of Amazon ’ s experimental streaming box , though , or want a streamer that can act as an AV control center , the Fire TV Cube may be the one for you .
Amazon could be about to release its answer to the Apple AirPods , according to a report by CNBC . Citing `` a person directly involved in the project '' , the report details true wireless earbuds – codenamed 'Puget ' – that double up as a fitness tracker , with a built-in accelerometer and the ability to monitor things like `` distance run , calories burned and pace of running '' . The new earbuds will reportedly cost less than $ 100 ( £80 / AU $ 150 ) , which would undercut the Apple AirPods ( and much of the true wireless competition ) by a fairly large margin . They 'll also come with Alexa built-in , giving access to the voice assistant on the go . As well as true wireless earbuds , the source also claimed that Amazon will release a new Amazon Echo speaker – a bulkier device with improved sound quality . The speaker is reportedly `` designed to be the central speaker in Alexa 's core home market , '' which suggests that it might usurp the original Amazon Echo – and with `` a woofer and a higher quality speaker '' , it should address some of the audio issues suffered by its predecessor . So when will we see these new Amazon devices ? Right now , everything 's pointing to September 25 , when Amazon is holding a launch event in Seattle . If Amazon does launch the new running earphones on September 25 , it could pose a challenge for Apple – after all , its own true wireless earbuds are the current market leaders . We had expected fitness tracking and biometric sensors to come to the yet-to-be-released AirPods 2 , but with no word on a release date , it looks like Amazon will beat the tech giant to the punch – in any case , we should find out on September 25 .

While Black Friday and Cyber Monday might be a few months away yet , we 're always keen to track down the very best cheap Kindle prices for you . And we 've found a selection of offers today that may well tempt a purchase sooner rather than later . These fresh Kindle deals cover the Kindle Paperwhite and the entry-level Kindle too for both our US and UK readers . There are some catches to consider though . Some deals require Amazon Prime membership ( fancy a free 30-day trial ? ) , some are time-limited and others are for refurbished models ( the latter are n't that great if we 're honest ) . We 'll talk you through each of them though . Another important element to consider too is that there may well be a new version of the Kindle Paperwhite announced in the next few weeks and it will most certainly be a headliner of the upcoming Amazon Black Friday deals event . As for the standard entry-level Kindle , that was only released a few months ago , so do n't expect another until next year at the earliest . Kindle Paperwhite $ 129.99 $ 89.99 at Amazon Update : this offer has expired . This price is exclusively for Amazon Prime members and matches the lowest ever price for the fantastic waterproof ereader . The only way we see this going any lower on Black Friday is if a newer version is announced before then and Amazon want to clear these out . This price is available on both the black and blue models . View Deal Kindle Paperwhite ( last gen ) $ 99.99 $ 79.99 at Amazon The older version of the Paperwhite is still an excellent ereader although it is n't waterproof like the newer version . This price is for a refurbished model rather than an unused one too , although you do n't have to be a Prime member to buy it . Even so , we think it 's a bit much for a refurb of an older model . You 'll likely to see better around Black Friday . View Deal Kindle ( 2019 ) $ 89.99 $ 64.99 at Amazon Update : this offer has expired . This is the cheapest price yet for the new version of the entry-level Kindle reader , but it 's only for Prime members . Amazon added a light to this version 's screen ( a first for the cheapest Kindle ) , putting it on a par with the older Paperwhite for a fraction of the price .

If you ’ re looking for unlimited , ad-free music across devices and you ’ re already an Amazon customer , it could be time to check out the online shopping giant ’ s Music Unlimited service , which challenges Apple Music , Spotify and YouTube Music head-on with aggressively priced subscription packages . Available as an app on-the-go , or on all your smart home Alexa-enabled devices like the excellent Echo-series , the monthly or annual subscription service delivers tunes straight to your device , gives you plenty of scope for playlist making and suggested artist discovering , and it simultaneously undercuts much of the competition too . [ Update : Amazon Music now has a Hi-Res Audio streaming tier , called Amazon Music HD . It 's currently being rolled out in the US , UK , Germany , and Japan , and it 'll cost $ 12.99 / £12.99 for Prime members , and $ 14.99 / £14.99 for everyone else – cheaper than Tidal 's lossless streaming tier , which costs $ 19.99 / £19.99 . ] Amazon Music Unlimited is a music streaming service that offers on-demand access to tens of millions of songs . Through the service , you can also access thousands of playlists , create your own or discover music with personalised Amazon Music stations and recommendations . If you have an internet connection , you can access Amazon Music Unlimited anywhere , either through the app or the website , and even if you don ’ t , supported devices can save your music offline , so your long-haul flights and underground commutes can be lifted by a soundtrack of your choice . If you have a smartphone or tablet , odds are , it can run Amazon Music unlimited . Just dive into the Apple App Store on your iOS device , Google Play Store on your Android Device or the Fire Store on your Kindle Fire tablet . Next , search for Amazon Music , download the app , and you ’ re good to go . The music doesn ’ t stop there , however . Amazon Music is also accessible on Alexa devices throughout your smart home , whether it ’ s an Alexa enabled smart speaker , like the Sonos One , a Fire TV , or one of Amazon ’ s speakers or screens like the Echo Plus or the Echo Show . If you already have an excellent – but disconnected – sound system , you could even smarten it up and enable Amazon Music Unlimited on it with an Amazon Echo Input - one of our favourite , affordable gadgets of 2019 . Even if you don ’ t have a phone or smart speaker to hand , fire up a web browser window , and you can also access the service by heading to music.amazon.com , where you can access all your recommendations , playlists and saved albums at the office or a party in a pinch . Accessing tracks through the app or a browser couldn ’ t be easier , and with tens of millions of songs to choose from , it ’ ll probably have the one you ’ re looking for . There ’ s a familiar search bar in which to type in the artist , album or title you want to find . The results also display what you searched for , as well as some recommendations and playlists to help you find related tunes and broaden your musical repertoire . You can also find tracks by talking too , if you ’ ve got an Alexa enabled device . A quick “ Alexa , play Abba , The Winner Takes It All ” , will fire the song up , or if you want more of a mood setting playlist , “ Alexa , play some dinner jazz ” will have your party ambience on-point in moments Pushing your musical taste boat out and discovering new tracks is also a doddle , with curated Amazon ’ s Prime Playlists comprehensively spanning genres and decades . You can follow lists , which get updated so you ’ re always on top of new music , and you can even see what other Amazon Music Unlimited customers who listened to your favorite tracks listen to as well . A standard subscription price for a single user signing up to Amazon Music Unlimited is $ 9.99/£9.99 per month , but you can get your first four months for just 99¢/99p , working out to less than 25¢/25p per month . After the trial period is over , the monthly subscription bumps up to $ 9.99/£9.99 for standard users , $ 7.99/£7.99 if you ’ re an Amazon Prime member and $ 4.99/£4.99 for students . These subscriptions can be used across multiple devices , but offer only one user profile . If you just want an Amazon Music Unlimited subscription for your smart speaker , but not on the go , that costs $ 3.99/£3.99 per month , per device , or you can get a family plan for $ 14.99/£14.99 per month for up to six users . Prime users can also benefit from some hefty discounts if they pay annually . You can sign-up through your Android device , PC or Mac , Fire TV or Fire tablet - look for a “ Go Unlimited ” button to get started , go with a free plan or access the promotional four-month trial . Once subscribed , you can manage your subscription settings from your Amazon account through a browser - and you can cancel your subscription or free trial at any time . No , as great as Prime Music is as part of your Amazon Prime subscription , it isn ’ t anywhere near as comprehensive when it comes to the number of tracks available , when compared to Amazon Music Unlimited . A simple example is Elton John ’ s back catalogue , with tracks like I Guess That ’ s Why They Call It The Blues only available as part of Music Unlimited . In our search , 6/10 tracks we looked for were available on Prime Music , and 9/10 were available on Music Unlimited . Yes , and no . The streaming music aspect of Spotify is very much covered by Amazon Music Unlimited . That said , it doesn ’ t officially support podcasts just yet , and Karaoke tracks , in particular , seem to be a bit thin on the ground , unlike on Spotify . When it comes to price , it does undercut the other services if you ’ re a Prime Member , especially if you have a six-person family . Breaking down the maths , an annual six-person subscription is $ 149/£149 . If you have six users , that ’ s around $ 2/£2 per month , per user . Meanwhile , Spotify ’ s family-subscription is $ 14.99/£14.99 per month , which works out to $ 2.50/£2.50 per user . Over the year , that ’ s a saving of $ 30.88/£30.88 for the family on Amazon Music Unlimited versus Spotify . As a result , if you ’ re living in a household filled with Alexa devices and people , and are tired of Peppa Pig popping up in your suggested tracks , then Amazon Music Unlimited could be a cost-effective way to get every member of your family , or every smart speaker a music profile of their , or its , own .
Amazon has announced that its bringing Hi-Res Audio to its music streaming platform , Amazon Music Unlimited . Called Amazon Music HD , the new streaming tier will give audiophiles and casual music fans alike access to `` the highest quality streaming audio available '' , according to the tech giant . Over 50 million lossless songs will be available in CD-quality , with more tracks available in even higher resolution ; Amazon says they 'll go up to `` a bit depth of 24 bits and a sample rate of up to 192 kHz '' . Amazon Music HD is currently being rolled out in the US , UK , Germany , and Japan , and it 'll cost $ 12.99 / £12.99 for Prime members , and $ 14.99 / £14.99 for everyone else – cheaper than Tidal 's lossless streaming tier , which costs $ 19.99 / £19.99 . That works out at around AU $ 19 / AU $ 22 , but there 's no word on when the service will go truly global . If you already have an Amazon Music Unlimited subscription , you 'll just need to pay an additional $ 5 / £5 per month on top of your existing fee . According to Steve Boom , VP of Amazon Music , part of the company 's motivation to enable Hi-Res Audio on its platform came from a desire to allow customers to hear music `` as it was originally recorded '' – instead of the compressed digital streaming files many of us have become used to . Boom also revealed that Amazon consulted with musicians when created Amazon Music HD , including rock icon Neil Young – and Young believes that it will be the `` biggest thing to happen in music since the introduction of digital audio 40 years ago '' . With Amazon gearing up for a large launch event in Seattle on September 25 , we could potentially see new Amazon Echo devices with a greater focus on audio fidelity – could we be in for an Echo Plus that rivals the best wireless speakers like the Sonos One ? We 'll have to wait until the end of the month to find out , but it 's clear that Amazon is finally taking high quality music-streaming seriously .

If you never get around to leaving ratings for the stuff you 've bought online , Amazon has an idea for you : star ratings that can be left in a single tap on your phone . The speedy review system is being tested at the moment with a select group of users , TechCrunch reports , and might eventually get rolled out to the wider community of online Amazon shoppers . A robust review system helps users , sellers , and Amazon itself of course , so it 's perhaps no surprise that Amazon is looking at ways to make it more straightforward for people to leave their feedback . With the new approach , you can put up a star rating without having to fill out the extra fields , like a review title and a full written review , like you do at the moment . What 's more , the option to leave ratings is going to be available from more places on the Amazon website , and in the Amazon app – it 's going to be easier than ever to register your thoughts on a product . The system will still allow you to leave a more detailed review , if you want to , so the lengthy reviews ( complete with anecdotes and illustrative pictures ) are n't going away anytime soon . Amazon will be hoping to give the reviews on its items a boost in terms of both volume and authenticity , but as yet there 's no word on if or when the feature is going to become a permanent fixture on the website and in the Amazon app . `` We are testing a feature that allows customers to leave feedback easily while also helping shoppers get authentic customer ratings on products from a broader set of shoppers , '' an Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch .

At this rate , you ’ re going to need to build an extension on your house to accommodate all the Amazon Echo speakers out there : Amazon has just announced that it ’ s going to be hosting a large launch event in Seattle at the end of this month , September 25 . In what ’ s now becoming an annual tradition for the company , we ’ re expecting Amazon to reveal details on refreshed Amazon Echo speakers , as well as a likely expansion of its own-brand Alexa-enabled home appliances . It was a bumper showcase last year , with not only fresh Echo Dot and Echo Plus speakers in the mix , but also all-new devices like Echo Wall Clocks and even microwaves . With such a large range of devices in its portfolio , there ’ s plenty of potential for refreshes and brand new launches right across the board . We ’ d love to see an extension of the Fire TV-in-an-actual-television trend that the company has kicked off this year . The Fire TV interface is robust and feature-rich , but so far it ’ s been paired with only middling TV panels ; a premium set with Fire TV built in would be exciting to see . The Amazon Echo Plus , though billed as Amazon ’ s premium sound system , is still lacking against the competition . So a real effort to make it as sonically capable as top-tier audio gear , while retaining an accessible price point , would be appreciated . Plus , with the Amazon Echo Wall Clock finally available globally , perhaps a more feature-rich timepiece , a talking clock even , powered by onboard Alexa , would be a massive improvement over what we currently have . We ’ ll be on the ground in Seattle to share all and any Amazon news as it happens , so keep checking back for more details shortly .

Amazon has announced the new Fire TV Cube , an updated version of its Alexa-enabled hands-free streaming media player , adding Dolby Vision and a few other new features to the mix . It 's twice as powerful as the previous generation , with a new hexa-core processor for a faster user experience . It should be quicker when reacting to voice commands , opening apps and pulling up the content you want to watch . Another new feature on the Fire TV Cube ( 2nd Gen ) is Local Voice Control , which lets it quickly execute some of the most frequently used voice commands , such as `` Alexa , scroll right '' , `` Alexa , go home '' , `` Alexa , select number one '' , and more . Amazon claims reactions to these commands are up to four times faster versus the first generation box . You still get support for 4K Ultra HD playback at 60fps , Dolby Atmos audio , HDR and HDR10+ , along with over 50 apps including Netflix , YouTube and Prime Video , plus if you 're in the US you can access live TV stations directly from the second-generation Fire TV Cube . And of course you can summon Alexa , allowing you to control the device ( plus your soundbar , TVs , A/V receiver and cable or satellite box ) with your voice - although a physical remote is also included . Previously the Cube has only been available in the US , but the new Amazon Fire TV Cube will also be available in Canada , the UK and Germany from October 10 and Japan from November 5 . As for the new Fire TV Cube price , it will set you back $ 119 ( £109.99 , around AU $ 175 ) - the same price as the previous generation . IFA 2019 is Europe 's biggest tech show , and the TechRadar team is in Berlin to bring you all the breaking news and hands-on first impressions of new TVs , laptops , wearables and other products as they 're announced .
Amazon is planning to roll out new biometric scanners which will use hand scans as a means of identifying customers at Whole Foods supermarkets . The company is currently testing the system in its own offices , giving employees the opportunity to make purchases from vending machines with their hands . Code-named Orville , the system can process transactions in just 300 milliseconds rather than the three or four seconds card payments take , reports the New York Post . The payment system will be made available to Amazon Prime subscribers who will be able to link a payment card to a scan of their hand so they can benefit from fast check-out in stores . Amazon 's hand scanning system differs from traditional fingerprint readers in an important way . Much like iris scanners , there is no need to physically touch the scanner . Instead , sensors use depth geometry and imagery to identify hands with impressive speed and accuracy . The New York Post 's anonymous sources say that the system is currently accurate to within one ten-thousandth of a percent , but Amazon is said to be looking to improve this to one millionth of a percent . The move away from requiring payment cards – or even a phone – would certainly make payment quicker and easier for customers . What 's not clear , however , is how the system will be received . With any biometric system there are privacy and security concerns , and this appears to be something Amazon has considered in opting for hand recognition rather than facial recognition . It remains to be seen whether Whole Foods customers are ready to embrace hand-based payments , but we 'll find out as the system is due to roll out to a small number of stores by the start of 2020 , before spreading to all US branches of the supermarket .

LG could be about to release a brand new Google Assistant smart speaker at the IFA 2019 tech show in Berlin , according to a report by the Dutch edition of Lets Go Digital . The report highlights four smart speaker patents that were filed by LG back in August 2018 with the KIPRIS ( Korean Intellectual Property Office ) . It suggests that IFA , which is held from September 6 to 11 this year , could be the perfect time for the company to release the follow-up to the LG ThinQ WK7 smart speaker . With LG expected to reveal its upcoming dual-screen device at the Berlin tech event – likely the LG V60 ThinQ – it 's not out of the question that the company will also launch new audio hardware . Of course , patents do n't always make it out as tech in real-world products , but the four filed by LG in August 2018 could reveal a little about what its next smart speaker might look like . The first patent , Model A , looks similar to the LG ThinQ WK7 , albeit more angular in its design . On the top of the speaker are four buttons , while a power button appears on one of the speaker 's four sides . According to Let 's Go Digital , a `` small display '' also appears on one of the other sides , but we 're struggling to make it out from where we 're sitting . Models B , C , and D are all smart displays , like the Google Home Hub or the Amazon Echo Show . Based on the images in the patents , Model B could have a bigger focus on audio , with a large speaker grille underneath its display ; the other smart display patents are far thinner and seem to have more of a focus on the display than the speaker itself . This would n't be the first time LG has released a smart display , if it does ever launch one of these concepts ; the LG WK9 Wireless Speaker with Google Assistant came with an 8-inch touchscreen and Chromecast built-in , when it was launched at CES 2018 . We 'll have to wait and see whether LG actually launches a new smart speaker at this year 's IFA show , but if it does it could look a little like the patents it filed this time last year .

The Amazon Echo Dot is so cheap on Amazon right now that you may swear that it 's Black Friday or Cyber Monday . We checked with Alexa – that 's just not the case . The 3rd gen Echo Dot is $ 0.99 on Amazon in the US , with the caveat that you have to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited for one month , which costs $ 7.99 alone . So , even if you do n't really want Music Unlimited , you 're paying a total of $ 8.98 for a smart speaker that typically costs $ 25 when on sale and $ 49.99 as its official MSRP . You can still buy the Echo Dot 3rd gen for $ 49.99 right now , believe it or not . Echo Dot ( 3rd Gen ) $ 49.99 $ 0.99 or $ 8.98 at Amazon It really depends on how you look at this Echo Dot deal – it 's either $ 0.99 if you intended to pair Amazon 's music service with it , or still a tempting $ 9 if that 's not something you want . View Deal We rarely suggest you buy the Amazon Echo Dot outside of these three days : Black Friday , Cyber Monday , and Amazon Prime Day . It 's just not worth paying full price . Today seems to be the one exception , with Amazon dropping the price in order to increase its Amazon Music Unlimited subscriber count . Well , count us in . There 's one thing you should know before signing up . Amazon forces you to enable auto-renewal in this Music Unlimited bundle , so you could get charged another $ 7.99 if you 're not careful and forget to cancel . Alexa can always help you set a reminder to cancel , and with that , you can escape with an Amazon Echo Dot 3rd gen for just $ 8.98 . Not too shabby .

Amazon is continuing its push into the healthcare space by acquiring a startup called Health Navigator that provides technology as well as services to digital health companies . CNBC reached out to the e-commerce giant which confirmed the acquisition and said that Heath Navigator will become part of the company 's recently launched Amazon Care group . Amazon Care provides medical benefits to the company 's employees through telemedicine but in-home visits are also available when additional care is required . An Amazon spokesperson provided more details on Amazon Care to CNBC in an email , saying : `` The service eliminates travel and wait time , connecting employees and their family members to a physician or nurse practitioner through live chat or video , with the option for in-person follow up services from a registered nurse ranging from immunizations to instant strep throat detection . '' Health Navigator currently has around a dozen employees which makes Amazon 's second acquisition in the healthcare space much smaller that when it purchased PillPack last year for $ 753m . The company has already made a significant investment into PillPack but entering the market has proven difficult for Amazon as other players in the space have prevented it from accessing patient data or trying to hire their employees . The CEO of Health Navigator , David Thompson founded the business back in 2014 and is already well known in the medical sector for developing the Schmitt-Thompson protocols . These protocols have now become the standard way for nurses and other hospital staff to guide patients to the right place , usually through call centers . In its work with technology partners such as Microsoft and other healthcare companies , Health Navigator provides a number of services such as symptom-checking tools that can aid with remote diagnoses and the company helps patients determine whether they should stay home , see a doctor or head straight to the emergency room . Neither Amazon nor Health Navigator have yet to make an official announcement regarding the acquisition but we will likely hear more once the recently acquired company becomes a part of Amazon Care . We 've also highlighted the best telemedicine software of 2019

For a few years now , Amazon has been far and away the most convenient online retailer out there . With its Amazon Prime program , you can get free next-day shipping on plenty of products . But , now Best Buy is coming for Amazon 's turf . Just in time for Black Friday 2019 , Best Buy is implementing free next-day shipping to `` 99 % of its customers . '' And , if one day is too much to ask , you 'll even be able to get same-day shipping in many areas – though you 'll have to pay extra for that . In order to get free next-day delivery at Best Buy , there are a couple requirements . First , you 'll have to make sure the product you 're trying to buy supports next-day shipping . Luckily , it 'll say whether the product you 're looking at is available for next-day shipping right above that big , yellow `` Add to Cart '' button . Then , you 'll just have to make sure you 're spending at least $ 35 , not including digital codes . That means you might not be able to get free next-day delivery if you just buy a new Blu-Ray , but if you 've just acted on an amazing PS4 Pro deal , you should have no problem getting free next-day delivery . Just be aware that this program is n't available everywhere , so you may want to plug in your zip code before you actually hit that buy button . So , basically , if you 're looking to pick up some new techy gifts for your loved ones ( or for yourself , we do n't judge ) , you should n't feel pressured to just go for Amazon . With this free next-day shipping , you can get your shiny new technology faster , so you can just get to playing with it . And , with all the Best Buy Black Friday deals we 're expecting to see , this new shipping policy is just in time . Via PC Gamer
As controversial as this is going to sound , I believe Amazon Music Unlimited could become the best music streaming service in 2020 – better than Apple Music and , yes , better than Spotify . What makes that such a controversial opinion is that Apple and Spotify are absolutely dominating in terms of subscriber count and market share in an area that Amazon , despite its position as the world ’ s leading online retailer , just can ’ t seem to win… and not for a lack of trying . To chip away at the competitors , Amazon has created a number of different music streaming services ( three , if we ’ re being precise ) each of which serves a different audience : There ’ s Amazon Prime Music that has around 2 million songs and comes free with your Prime subscription . There ’ s Amazon Music Unlimited that has around 30 million songs , but costs a monthly fee . And then there ’ s the newly announced Amazon Music HD , that has the most songs of the bunch , with some of them are available in Hi-Res 24-bit/192KHz . For years , Amazon has only had the two tiers but the new third tier – in addition to some competitive advantages Amazon has in the works right now – could give it the momentum it needs to finally cut through the static and reach the mainstream music listener . Admittedly , it ’ s not going to be easy for Amazon ’ s smaller , less-popular music service ( s ) to take over the charts next year – Spotify has the industry in a vice grip and Apple Music courted its fanbase with a free three-month trial at launch and several deals since then . If you sign up for the former right now , you ’ ll get three months free – that ’ s just as good as Apple Music and Spotify – but Amazon will need to sweeten the pot to get listeners on-board . If Amazon wants to win , it ’ s going to have to fight fire with fire… or , rather , deals with deals : To start , Amazon needs to offer a killer Black Friday deal on Amazon Music Unlimited and Music HD . If you sign up for the former right now , you ’ ll get three months free – that ’ s just as good as Apple Music and Spotify – but Amazon will need to sweeten the pot to get listeners on-board . The good news for us ? There ’ s a historical precedence for this and it ’ s not just wishful thinking . In fact , earlier this year , Amazon offered a pretty killer deal on Amazon Music Unlimited during Amazon Prime Day where you could pay $ 1 for four months of service . Obviously there ’ s no guarantee that Amazon will run something like that again this year , but if it really wants to launch its service into the stratosphere , it ’ s deals like these that will push it into a position where it can compete with Apple and Spotify . But , as we all know , having a high subscriber count doesn ’ t make you the best music streaming service on its own . Sure , popularity is good and it has its advantages , but at the end of the day it comes down to the sound quality and device support – two areas that Amazon is making a massive improvement on in the next six months . One of the keys here , in terms of hardware , is going to be the Amazon Echo Studio . It ’ s Amazon ’ s Hi-Res answer to the Apple HomePod and , from what we ’ ve seen so far , it could really change the game for Amazon ’ s streaming service . At $ 199.99 / £189.99 / AU $ 329 it ’ s not the cheapest speaker on the planet but , if Amazon delivers any sort of discount , its Hi-Res compatibility and serious smart home chops could be the key to getting more folks to sign up for Amazon ’ s higher-end streaming service . Not only does it make use of Amazon ’ s “ ultra high definition ” music streams ( to use the term Amazon is co-opting for its hi-res offering ) , but it ’ s also supporting and championing Dolby Atmos and Sony ’ s 360 Reality Audio formats . These immersive , relatively-new audio tracks can make it appear as sounds are coming from above and all around you , singling out individual instruments from a mix . Amazon Music HD is the only streaming service to support these formats , and the Echo Studio will be one of , if not the , most affordable single speaker you can listen to them on . Now if only there were some sort of massive shopping holiday coming up that Amazon , a company notorious for marking down its own products , could take advantage of ...

At least eight eavesdropping apps have slipped past Google and Amazon 's app verification process and made their way into their respective app stores , ready to be downloaded onto the smart speakers of unsuspecting victims . As Ars Technica reports , researchers at hacking collective Security Research Labs ( SRLabs ) built four Google Home actions and four Alexa skills , which looked like innocuous tools for checking horoscopes and generating random numbers , but were also capable of phishing for passwords and monitoring users ' conversations . All of these apps passed through Google and Amazon 's security checks , and were published for others to download . When a user asked to know their horoscope , the eavesdropping apps provided the information as expected . They then seemed to stop running , but actually remained active and listening in the background . Conversations were logged and sent to a remote server . When a victim attempted to use one of the phishing apps , they would receive an error message informing them that the app was unavailable in their country . The app would again remain running , and after a short break would use a voice similar to that used by Alexa or Google Home to inform the user that an update was available , and ask for their password . Researchers at Sophos recently identified several apps in the Google Play Store that used a similar trick – throwing up up fake error messages while continuing to run in the background and perform malicious operations – but users are even less likely to expect such malware on their smart speakers . SRLabs reported its findings to Amazon and Google , both of which removed the apps from their respective stores and promised they would tighten their appraisal processes in the future to make sure genuinely malicious software is n't able to slip through the same way . For the time being , you 're well advised to follow the Sophos team 's advice on installing new apps : always read reviews , and sort them so you see the most recent ones first ( the malicious element might have been added with a recent update ) . Filter out any five-star reviews with no written text , as these are likely to be fake , and look closely at the remainder . If several reviewers complain about the app causing problems or not behaving as expected , you 'd be better off avoiding it .

Getting anything for free can often sound too good to be true , not least if it 's one of the most popular smart speakers on the planet , like the Amazon Echo Dot . However , the Alexa Perks Program is making Echo freebies a reality , with a new promotion meaning that anyone who builds their first , new Alexa Skill will get an Amazon Echo Dot , completely free of charge . Alexa Skills are like special tricks that your Echo smart speaker can perform for you – from turning on the lights in your home through to ordering a pizza . Not only that , but if you publish three new Alexa skills , and `` one of them is used by at least 75 unique users during the promotion period , '' you 'll get an Amazon Echo Show 5 voucher – which is worth $ 89.99 / £79.99 / AU $ 129 . You can also earn the original Echo Show by adding Alexa Presentation Language to one of your skills , which must reach 150 unique users during the promotion period ; this allows you `` to build interactive voice and visual experiences across the device landscape , '' including slideshows , graphics , images , and videos , according to Amazon . The promotion period ends on November 30 , so you 'll have to be quick if you want a free Echo speaker ; it currently only applies in the UK , Republic of Ireland , Germany , Austria , France , Italy and Spain . The same promotion was available last year in the US , but it could be coming back soon , with Amazon saying it will update its US Incentives for Alexa Skill Builders `` in the coming weeks '' . Sound like too much hard work ? Do n't forget that the Amazon Echo Dot will likely be discounted in the near future , with the Echo Dot with Clock usurping the company 's smallest Alexa speaker . Plus , Black Friday and Cyber Monday are coming up very soon , with the massive sales event kicking off proper on November 29 ( although you 'll find that the deals start to trickle in from early November onwards ) . This means that the Echo Dot , Echo Show 5 , and Echo Show could all see their prices slashed , among other Amazon devices – so , if you want an easy way to get Alexa at a discount , it 's worth hanging on until the Amazon Black Friday deals start rolling in .

Rumors had already been swirling about a pair of new Nvidia Shield TV products , and a recent leak on Amazon suggests one will be an Nvidia Shield TV Pro launching on October 28 , Android Authority reports . The product listing showed a similar design to the existing Nvidia Shield TV , but an updated remote with backlit buttons . The price was listed at $ 199 , which would fit the $ 199 / £189 / AU $ 249.95 launch price of its predecessor . But , there are some clear reasons to upgrade , including the new Nvidia Tegra X1+ chip , which can boost performance up to 25 % , plus , and support for Dolby Vision HDR content . We already hold the Nvidia Shield TV in high regard , as it offers the best Android TV experience available . That 's thanks to its high performance and its versatility as a smart home control , streaming platform and gaming device all in one . The upgraded chip inside the Nvidia Shield TV Pro is nice , but there 's no increase in memory or storage . The new device will have two USB 3.0 ports , which opens the door for easy expansion with external storage , but 16GB is still on the small side to start . Another miss is the devices use of 802.11ac wireless ( Wi-Fi 5 ) , when Wi-Fi 6 is now an option . Of course , that can be remedied by using an Ethernet cable for a fast and reliable connection . The timing of the Shield TV Pro could n't be better , though . Why 's that ? Google Stadia . Google 's online game streaming service , is set to launch November 19 , and there have been rumors both that the Nvidia Shield TV will support Stadia and that Google Stadia will come to Android TV . The slated launch of the Nvidia Shield TV Pro may be a bit early for the Stadia launch , but that gives it time to gain some traction and attention before the streaming service goes live . So , for current gamers and would-be gamers getting excited about Stadia , the updated Nvidia Shield TV Pro may prove a winning option over the less versatile Chromecast Ultra and Stadia controller pairing Google is offering .

Want something extra special from your music streaming services ? Well Sony 's 360 Reality Audio technology , which recreates the experience of live music by enhancing tracks for a surround sound feel , is set to come your way very soon . Sony 360 Reality Audio will be coming to a host of music streaming services later this year , with a launch window ( given to Engadget ) suggesting it wo n't arrive any later than November . There 'll reportedly be 1,000 tracks available in the format , marking a somewhat hesitant launch giving the massive libraries of the services they 'll be coming to . Amazon Music HD , Tidal , and Deezer will all be getting tracks featuring the technology , though Spotify wo n't be supporting it at launch . A lesser-known streaming service called nugs.net , though , apparently will . There 's been an ongoing push for high-resolution audio , with Tidal 's Masters tier for high-res audio tracks , and Amazon making over 50 million lossless songs available in CD quality in its Amazon Music HD tier . But Sony 360 Reality Audio is specifically trying to give a different flavor to the music available beyond the bitrate and audio detail , with a sense of music filling the space around you – in a similar way to the Creative SXFI Air headphones , though built into dedicated tracks rather than an all-round hardware feature for whatever you 're listening to . The lack of Spotify support is n't overly surprising , given that the massive streaming service is still relying on mp3 audio ( which requires less data to stream ) rather than chasing high-res quality – though if you want premium audio from a music streaming service , it seems there are plenty that want to give it to you .

If your Apple Music subscription has run out , there ’ s some good news : starting today , you ’ ll be able to stream Amazon Music on the Apple TV and Apple TV 4K . Subscribers will be able to listen to the 40 million songs available through Amazon 's service as well as access their favorite artists , playlists and purchased music , according to Amazon 's blog post . The app ’ s arrival doesn ’ t come as a surprise considering that Apple Music launched on Fire TV back in March , but it does show that the two previously feuding companies are now more eager to work together . The other less obvious advantage to allowing Amazon Music on the Apple App Store is that it increases the competition among streaming apps - especially with Apple 's own Apple Music service . Recently Spotify said that Apple 's ownership of both the platform and its own service are textbook anti-competitive behavior , which has led to the US government to investigate the situation . With Amazon Music now on-board , Apple can now say that it has another rival music streaming services on Apple TV , shoring up its defense should the probe progress any further . That being said , if you 're more excited about streaming your Amazon Music library than you are about Apple 's stratagems , you can download the Amazon Music app on the Apple TV App Store starting today in the US , UK , Australia , New Zealand , Brazil , Canada , France , Italy , Spain , Germany , Mexico , Japan , and India .

Oracle is pushing hard on the cloud front with plans to extend its cloud services to further locations globally , an expansion which involves the hiring of almost 2,000 fresh staff members . Don Johnson , executive VP of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure development , revealed these plans to Reuters , with the move reportedly being part of transitioning Oracle ’ s business software for finance and sales ( and more ) to new systems over the course of the next year . By the time 2020 comes to a close , Oracle intends to have opened 20 more cloud regions – for a grand total of 36 regions globally – where it has data centers to allow customers to comply with any local data storage regulations . The new regions will be situated across Asia and Europe , as well as in Chile , South Africa and United Arab Emirates . Naturally this is all part of a bigger drive to compete with the cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft for a slice of a cloud market which is expected to see strong growth , driven by the current ever-present economic instability which is causing companies to look cloud-wards in order to cut costs . Gartner has predicted that the total public cloud services market will see growth of over 17 % this year , rising to $ 214 billion , and will likely only strengthen from thereon out , reaching a predicted $ 330 billion by the year 2022 . The expansion is built around Oracle ’ s second-gen cloud infrastructure , and Johnson explained to Reuters : “ We ’ re driving this very , very aggressively . We are very rapidly converting what ’ s a complex footprint to be a very simple footprint : Everything everywhere runs on our generation two cloud infrastructure . ”

Amazon has been accused of putting shoppers at risk by recommending products with serious security flaws An investigation by consumer watchdog Which ? carried out extensive tests on six wireless cameras recommended by Amazon and found serious security flaws that could leave users exposed to hackers . This was despite the fact that these devices have thousands of positive reviews and were even able to earn a coveted “ Amazon 's Choice ” recommendation . To make matters worse , many of these devices are marketed as being suitable for use as baby monitors . The investigation found a number of issues including weak passwords and strangers being able to remotely control these cameras to spy on users and access their unencrypted data . Which ? was first alerted to these problems by industry experts and comments in Amazon reviews including a rather shocking one from a father who said he had “ chills down his spine ” after hearing a mysterious voice coming from a camera next to his child 's crib after it was apparently hacked . Which ? carried out lab tests on four cameras suspected of having security issues : the Victure 1080p , Vstarcam C7837WIP , ieGeek 1080p and the Sricam 720p . It was quite simple for the testers to gain root access to the Victure 1080p which would enable a hacker to take complete control of the camera and view footage captured from the device as they pleased . The Vstarcam C7837 had a default username that was set to the basic 'admin ' as well as an easily guessable default password . The ieGeek 1080p and Sricam 720p cameras both use the same app and because of this , both devices share the same security flaw . Which ? found that WiFi passwords were sent unencrypted over the internet when a user entered them on both devices . This would enable an attacker to access the user 's home WiFi network to see what users are doing on the web and even gain access to data stored on other devices in their home . Some of the cameras the consumer association looked into even had their passwords and usernames written clearly on the side of the product and users frequently uploaded pictures of them alongside reviews . This opens up users of these devices to potential attacks regardless of whether or not the posted the picture as once the information is out there , hackers can easily use it to their advantage . Which ? has asked Amazon to remove these products from its store but when the group reached out to the e-commerce giant , the company declined to comment .
The launch of Disney Plus is now only a few weeks away , but viewers not in the first slate of territories for the Disney streaming service – including the US , UK , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , and the Netherlands – may be wondering how in Asgard they can access all those Disney Plus shows and movies . Well , it looks like Disney has a workaround in place , with a streaming deal with Amazon that will see selected Disney Plus titles come to the Amazon Prime Video platform in Latin America ( via Variety ) . Disney has a two-year roadmap to become a truly global service , and seemingly plans to release in Latin America in early 2021 , given its Amazon deal will run from October 2019 to September 2020 . If you 're curious about pricing , make sure you check out our Disney Plus price guide . It 's usual practice for providers to license their content out to competing platforms in territories they have yet to launch in . It gives us hope that Disney has n't given up on other key territories across Europe , with the possibility that Amazon could become a carrier for Disney Plus shows and movies before an official launch . While viewers in the Netherlands are already enjoying free preview access to the Disney Plus platform , others are having to wait , and there 's still no Disney Plus UK release date . With a host of legacy content from Disney , Pixar , Marvel , and Lucasfilm , and brand new Disney Plus shows including The Mandalorian , there are a lot of global viewers who will be feeling left out if they do n't have a legal avenue of accessing this content . Here 's hoping Amazon , or a platform like it , will be able to step in to bridge the gap elsewhere .

Amazon has reportedly designed a new more powerful processor chip for use in data centers as the company 's cloud computing division looks to break free from its reliance on server chips from Intel and AMD . The new AWS chip utilizes technology from Arm and according to sources familiar with the matter , it will be at least 20 percent faster than the company 's first Arm-based chip , Graviton , which was released last year . The cloud computing market is currently controlled by Intel and AMD with the former controlling more than 90 percent of the server processor market and the later controlling most of the remainder . However , several companies and chip designers are currently trying to adapt Arm 's chips , which currently power mobile phones , to make them suitable for use in data centers . While Amazon 's first Arm chip did not disrupt Intel 's data center business , Bernstein Analyst Stacy Rasgon believes that with the right backing , Arm could be a real challenger , saying : “ Arm by itself I ’ m not worried about , but Arm in the hands of an Amazon or a Google who could potentially invest in it , that becomes potentially more problematic . ” Sources familiar with the matter said that the e-commerce giant 's new chip is not expected to be as powerful as either Intel 's Cascade Lake or AMD 's Rome chips . Amazon 's first Graviton chip used older Cortex A72 technology from Arm but the new chip will likely use the firm 's Neoverse N1 technology . Another source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the chip is expected to have at least 32 cores compared to Graviton 's 16 . The new chip will also utilize a technology called a “ fabric ” which will allow it to connect with other chips to help accelerate resource heavy tasks such as image recognition . One hurdle still remains for the adoption of Arm chips in data centers and that is the fact that customers will likely have to use software written specifically for Arm-based chips and this is much less common than software developed for chips from Intel and AMD .

AMD ’ s Ryzen processors are totally dominating Intel chips in consumer desktop sales , at least by Amazon ’ s reckoning . If you look at Amazon.com ’ s ( US ) bestseller list of CPUs , no less than eight out of the top ten processors listed are AMD , with only a pair of Intel offerings present . And as Wccftech , which spotted this , notes , this has been the case for quite some time . The top dog chip is AMD ’ s Ryzen 7 2700X , in case you ’ re wondering ( more on that later ) . The retail giant ’ s bestseller list is updated hourly , and at the time of writing , stands pretty much exactly the same as Wccftech observed earlier ( and as remarked , has apparently been much like this for some time now ) . This isn ’ t really any shock , however , because since the launch of Ryzen 3000 , various sources have made AMD ’ s increasing dominance in the CPU world clear , and you ’ d struggle to find anyone who ’ d argue with you on this score . Although remember that looking at the broader processor arena , outside of desktop CPUs – so including OEM PCs and laptops , and business machines – Intel is still powering the majority of computers ( although even here , AMD is starting to gain serious ground – and in server CPUs as well , for that matter ) . All of which adds up to make a worrying picture for Intel , and to compound matters , supply issues are still plaguing the chip giant . Meaning Intel is kind of caught between a rock and a hard place at the moment – being pulled one way by the need to cut prices ( which it ’ s already doing with some processors ) to stay competitive with AMD ’ s technology , and being pulled another way by supply issues which would normally dictate that prices go up . As mentioned , the top-selling CPU is AMD ’ s Ryzen 7 2700X , which is somewhat surprising in that other sources we ’ ve seen have indicated the most popular chip is the Ryzen 5 3600 . In Amazon ’ s rankings , the Ryzen 5 3600 is in third , behind its predecessor the Ryzen 5 2600 – so yes , Ryzen 2nd-gen processors hold the top two spots here . That ’ s doubtless due to the knock-on effect of price-cutting which Ryzen 3000 ’ s release has caused for these older CPUs . For example , currently the 2600 is 40 % cheaper than the 3600 – and the former is still a great processor ( Black Friday could well usher in some even more tempting discounts , too ) . Where does Intel come in the top 10 ? Well , it actually holds fourth position after those three AMD chips , with the most popular Intel model being the Core i5-9600K . The Core i9-9900K is in sixth place , and sandwiched between those two Intel chips is AMD ’ s Ryzen 7 3700X .

Amazon is making it easier for hardware makers to add Alexa to millions more products . The company had revealed it is lowering the hardware requirements and enabling devices with very low-powered chips and just 1MB of RAM to run Alexa Voice Service . Alexa Voice Service ( AVS ) enables developers to access cloud-based Alexa capabilities with the support of AVS APIs , hardware kits , software tools and documentation . By handling complex speech recognition and natural language understanding in the cloud , Amazon is lowering the barrier to entry for businesses that want to add Alexa capabilities to their devices . Alexa built-in devices previously required at least 100MB of RAM and an ARM Cortex A-class processor . Now though , the requirement for AVS integration for AWS IoT Core has been lowered to just 1MB and device manufacturers can utilize cheaper Cortex-M processors . By lowering the hardware requirements needed to add Alexa to a device , Amazon is making it much easier for companies to build single-purpose devices such as light bulbs and light switches with Alexa functionality . These new devices wo n't be able to run complex voice-recognition models and decision engines locally , so all of that work will be done in the cloud . However , these single-purpose devices will still need to be able to detect the wake word to start the Alexa functionality . VP of IoT at AWS , Dirk Didascalou explained to TechCrunch that low-spec Alexa devices just need to be able to detect the wake word , saying : “ We now offload the vast majority of all of this to the cloud . So the device can be ultra dumb . The only thing that the device still needs to do is wake word detection . That still needs to be covered on the device . ” Lowering the requirements for Alexa devices could also end up being the first step towards ambient computing where users just have to speak to their environment and their environment can interact with them .

Amazon has filed a lawsuit in federal US court contesting the US Defense Department 's decision last month to award the $ 10bn Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure ( JEDI ) contract to its cloud computing rival Microsoft . According to a spokesperson from AWS , the complaint and supplemental motion for discovery were filed in the US Court of Federal Claims under seal . However , Amazon did not explain the basis for its complaint . In a court document seeking a protective order , Amazon explained that the filings contain “ proprietary information , trade secrets and confidential financial information ” which have the potential to “ cause either party severe competitive harm ” . The company also said that “ the record in this bid protest likely will contain similarly sensitive information ” . Suggestions of bias in the Pentagon 's decision to award Microsoft the $ 10bn JEDI contract were rejected by US Defense Secretary Mark Esper last week when Amazon announced its plans to challenge the decision . For quite some time , Amazon was believed to be the favorite to win the JEDI contract after IBM , Oracle and even Google dropped out of the bidding process . The e-commerce giant 's cloud computing division AWS was the most likely to win the lucrative contract which is why Microsoft being awarded it came as such a surprise . However , Amazon believes that politics got in the way of a fair bidding process as the company 's CEO Jeff Bezos has been an outspoken critic of President Trump . Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on the other hand , believes that staying out of politics played a big part in helping it win the Pentagon 's cloud computing contract . With $ 10bn on the line over ten years , it comes as no surprise that Amazon would try to appeal the Defense Department 's decision just as Oracle did when it filed a lawsuit earlier this year saying the contract favored a single cloud vendor .

For the last three years , the only way to get Spotify on an Amazon Echo or Sonos speaker was to shell out for Spotify Premium - Spotify ’ s premium streaming service that costs $ 9.99/ AU $ 11.99 per month . But starting today , Spotify announced that it 's changing its policies allowing everyone in the US , Australia and New Zealand who own an Amazon Echo , Sonos or Bose speaker to use Spotify ’ s ad-supported free service instead . For Amazon device owners that means you can use Spotify Free on your Echo devices like the Amazon Echo Dot and Amazon Echo Studio , as well as your Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV Cube – though you ’ ll need to link your Amazon and Spotify accounts to do so . The process is a bit different for Bose and Sonos speakers , which instead use Spotify Connect via the Spotify app to stream music , but the end result of free ad-supported music is exactly the same . It 's been a great few weeks if you 're someone who does n't like paying for music streaming services . First , Amazon announced that it would make its Amazon Music service available to everyone , not just folks who have an Amazon Prime subscription , and now Spotify is opening up its free service to more speakers . So , why is everyone opening up their digital catalogs to the masses ? As the music streaming market becomes more saturated with competition , the services need to make more accommodations to subscribers to keep them listening . It 's the reason that Spotify , a service that enabled listeners to choose what they listen to right from the outset , overtook Pandora as the world 's most popular streaming service . Opening up these services to the masses also makes the advertising side of the business more lucrative , so whatever Amazon and Spotify lose in subscription dollars , they 'll make up for advertising revenue . TL ; DR : You get free music and these services retain your business while keeping companies that advertise on the service happy .

Calling customer service could be about to get a lot less painful thanks to a new partnership between AWS and Salesforce . The software giant has announced it will be using AI technology from Amazon 's cloud computing arm into its Service Cloud to provide call transcription services directly to customer agents . Salesforce will be using Amazon Connect technology to turn conversations into text , allowing customer service agents to quickly identify any issues , and even detect if the customer is getting angry on the call . The new Salesforce Service Cloud is built directly into Salesforce 's existing platforms , bringing together phone , digital channels , and CRM data into one unified view . From the moment a call is received , the service can provide in-depth information on a customer 's past purchases and account history , offering instant suggestions to agents as to how to proceed with individual cases . Using tools such as Amazon Transcribe , Amazon Translate , and Amazon Comprehend , text can be translated into different languages , with Salesforce 's platform able to analyse the words and recommend answers to any questions being asked , rather than putting them on hold for a long period of time and risk losing the customer . `` Salesforce 's growing partnership with AWS is fueled by a shared commitment to customer success , '' said Bret Taylor , Salesforce Chief Product Officer . `` Together , we 're making it easier for companies to deploy powerful AI and voice technologies to deliver smarter and faster customer service experiences . '' “ For years AWS and Salesforce have had a deep relationship , and we share a commitment to integrate our services to provide customers with industry leading , enhanced solutions , ” said Ariel Kelman , Vice President , AWS . “ We are delighted that Salesforce has chosen Amazon Connect as its preferred contact center technology ... we are continuing to enable businesses to leverage the full power of both platforms to provide world-class customer service . ”
If you have an Amazon Fire TV Stick and an Echo speaker at home , you 've probably worked out that you can control your content using your voice , thanks to Alexa 's smarts . Until now though , you 've never been able to control your actual hardware , like turning your TV on and off , for example – and that 's where the new Amazon Fire TV Blaster comes in . This infrared companion device works alongside your existing Fire TV device and Echo speaker to extend Alexa 's control , which means you can switch HDMI inputs on your TV , adjust your AV receiver , change the volume on your soundbar , and even power your TV on and off , totally hands-free . Up for preorder now , the Amazon Fire TV Blaster will be available to buy from December 11 for $ 34.99 / £34.99 ( around AU $ 50 ) . If you preorder , you 're also eligible to order a bundle consisting of Fire TV Stick 4K , Echo Dot ( 3rd Gen ) and Fire TV Blaster for $ 79.99 / £86.98 , which is a pretty substantial saving . The new Fire TV Blaster does n't work on it 's own ; you 'll need a Fire TV Stick , Fire TV Stick 4K or Fire TV ( 3rd Gen ) , as well as an Echo speaker to be able to give Alexa voice commands to control your home cinema setup . If you already have these devices at home , the Fire TV Blaster represents a cheaper alternative to the $ 119 / £109.99 ( around AU $ 175 ) Fire TV Cube , which also works with Alexa , to control the device ( plus your soundbar , TVs , AV receiver and cable or satellite box ) with your voice .

Disney Plus , the long-awaited online streaming service from Disney , has finally landed on US shores – as well as Canada and the Netherlands . For those of you able to access the service already , you now face the tough decision of whether to ditch your other online streaming subscriptions or add another to your monthly outgoings . It 's not just Netflix out there anymore , with platforms like Hulu , HBO Max , or Apple TV Plus all fighting for our time , attention and money . You can see some other direct head-on comparisons in our guides to Disney Plus vs Netflix , Apple TV Plus vs Netflix , or Hulu and Disney Plus . But when it comes to Amazon , how does the retail giant-turned-streaming provider fare in the question of Disney Plus vs Amazon Prime Video ? We ’ ve collected together everything you need to know about Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video , to help you decide which one is right for you – considering what each service offers , how they work and , most importantly , the content they have to offer . Before you decide , remember that finding the right streaming service for you will be personal , and depend on which TV shows you can ’ t live without , your budget and whether you can afford to add another subscription alongside your current streaming plans . Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video are both online streaming services that offer a wide range of TV shows , movies , cartoons and documentaries . You can stream content , as well as watch it later on a mobile device with offline viewing , which is handy if you ’ re travelling without an internet connection . Disney Plus is yet to launch and when it does it ’ ll have a number of big-name properties under its belt , including Star Wars TV shows , Marvel flicks and every Disney movie you loved as a kid available to stream . On the other hand , Amazon ’ s TV streaming service has been around for over a decade and is already one of the top streaming platforms globally – even if it ’ s lagging behind Netflix . It offers a huge library of content , both new and old , as well as its own original TV series – even a Lord of the Rings TV show ! What ’ s more , Amazon Video also allows you to pay to rent or buy movies and TV shows that aren ’ t part of the streaming subscription . It ’ s worth mentioning that there are also a few other players in the online streaming rankings these days , including Netflix , Hulu , and HBO Go . Disney Plus has launched in the US , Canada and the Netherlands , with the platform coming to Australia and New Zealand on November 19 . Viewers in the UK and wider Europe will then get the service in March 2020 – a painful wait , but at least a date with some certainty . Disney Plus offers subscriptions for $ 6.99 ( around £5.50 / AU $ 10 ) a month or $ 69.99 ( around £55.50 / AU $ 100 ) a year . That subscription allows you to stream content to four devices at the same time , with a total of 10 mobile or tablet devices for a single account – and no constraints on how much you stream . You can see more about Disney Plus prices here . Unlike Netflix , there are no tiered pricing plans with Disney Plus . US viewers , however , can buy a bundle package that includes ESPN+ and Hulu – all for $ 12.99 a month – or the cheaper option for just the Disney platform , with a seven-day free trial . An single Amazon Prime membership seems much more expensive at $ 12.99 per month or $ 119 per year if you choose to pay annually . With this , you ’ re able to stream content to two devices at once with different formats ( like HD ) available . But when it comes to Amazon Prime Video , remember that you ’ ll also have an Amazon Prime membership . This will give you access to all things Prime Video and the Amazon Music streaming service – as well as same-day or one-day shipping , photo storage , access to exclusive deals and more . What about the Disney Plus interface ? As crucial as the actual content is , the way you navigate , find and stream it is a big part of the user experience . Disney Plus does n't offer anything too unfamiliar , with a similar layout to Amazon Prime Video and Netflix . You can read more about that in our Disney Plus review ( from time testing in the Netherlands beta ) . There ’ s a ‘ Recommended For You ’ stream and another called ‘ Continue Watching ’ , as well as five buttons across the top of the screen for the different channels on offer on Disney Plus , including Star Wars , National Geographic and Marvel . Amazon Prime Video has much the same format , recommending content based on your viewing habits and collecting titles together in different genres . Sometimes it ’ s not as easy as it should be to find recently-released content , but everything about Amazon Prime Video is intuitive enough . There ’ ll be a lot of content available on Disney Plus at launch , but will it be able to compete with the sheer amount of what ’ s on Amazon Prime Video ? On Disney Plus we can expect many movies , cartoons and TV shows you already know and love . This is going to include all your favorite Disney movies , both old and new , every episode of The Simpsons and every Pixar movie . As well as a big bank of older content , there ’ s also going to be a large choice of upcoming TV shows and movies courtesy of Disney ’ s big-budget properties , including Star Wars , Marvel and Pixar . One of the most highly-anticipated new TV shows is The Mandalorian , the first live-action TV show set in the Star Wars universe . There are also lots of new Marvel live-action TV shows in development , including WandaVision ( about the Scarlet Witch and Vision ) , Hawkeye , and The Falcon and The Winter Soldier . Disney also owns National Geographic , which means it ’ ll be a great place to visit for new documentaries about the natural world , providing a big mix of content whatever mood you ’ re in . Even if Netflix tends to dominate discussions of the best and biggest TV streaming services , Amazon Prime Video has long had an advantage in the sheer number of titles available – at last count having four times as many movies as Netflix . Of course , that doesn ’ t mean all of it is worth watching – there are lots of mediocre choices to weed through ( which is why we ’ ve put together lists of the best Amazon Prime movies and best Amazon TV series too ) . But if you ’ re after quantity above all else , Amazon Prime Video wins over the rest and has some of the best legacy content ever made , including Lost , Parks and Recreation and The X-Files . Just because there ’ s a lot of content available doesn ’ t mean Amazon isn ’ t great at investing in new content too . It ’ s created some fantastic TV shows over the years , including Transparent , The Tick , The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , The Boys , and Carnival Row , and it ’ ll also be producing the next season of hit science-fiction show The Expanse – and procured the rights to create a massive TV adaptation of The Lord of the Rings . It ’ s also home to a lot of shows it didn ’ t create but has exclusive licenses to stream in many regions , including Mr Robot and the upcoming Star Trek : Picard series . What ’ s interesting content-wise is that Disney has joined forces with Amazon , which will be streaming some Disney Plus content in regions where it hasn ’ t launched yet . According to reports , this deal is only in place in Latin America , but it could roll out to other countries soon . That means that if you ’ re not in the US , an Amazon Prime subscription could bring you all the benefits of Amazon as well as some of the top new shows from Disney Plus . It ’ s difficult to weigh up the pros and cons of Disney Plus in advance of its official launch but it certainly seems like a contender and might be worth switching your Amazon Prime and Netflix subscription for . However , finding the right streaming service for you all depends on what content you like to watch . So , when it comes to Disney Plus vs Amazon Prime , you ’ ll have to ask yourself whether there ’ s any content on Disney Plus that you can ’ t live without – e.g . Star Wars or Marvel movies . Or , whether there ’ s Amazon Prime content that ’ ll keep you coming back again and again , like Mr Robot and The Expanse . There ’ s no doubt about it : Disney Plus is going to have a lot of fantastic new content and old favorite legacy content that ’ ll be hard to beat . However , Amazon has an extensive back catalogue of movies and TV shows too , as well as a solid track record of award-winning originals . Amazon Prime is also a no-brainer if you enjoy any of the other Prime member benefits on Amazon , like super-fast deliveries on products . So there is no winner in the Disney Plus vs Amazon Prime head-to-head – just two great streaming services with different types of content on offer .
Amazon has announced that you can now hook up your Amazon Echo speakers with Fire TV devices , to create an immersive home cinema system – totally wireless , and all controllable with voice assistant Alexa . Depending on which Echo speakers you own , this means you can create wireless speaker configurations in a range of setups , including 1.0 ( one speaker in front of your TV ) and 2.0 ( one speaker on each side of your TV ) . If you have the Echo Sub , adding it to these setups will give you 1.1 and 2.1configurations , which are the same as above with the addition of a subwoofer to boost the bass frequencies . If you have the Amazon Echo ( 2019 ) or Echo Plus , you can stream Dolby Audio ; even better , those with with the Echo Studio will be able to stream `` Dolby-Atmos-quality sound '' , according to the company . This means you can get object-based surround sound without the need for a huge speaker setup or an upwards-firing soundbar , which should make for captivating films and TV shows . You 'll need to make sure that you have a compatible Fire TV device and Echo speaker . This includes the Fire TV Stick 4K , Fire TV ( 3rd Generation ) , Fire TV Cube , and Fire TV Cube ( 2nd Generation ) . Supported Echo speakers include the Amazon Echo ( 2017 ) , Echo ( 2019 ) , Echo Dot ( 3rd Generation ) , Echo Plus , Echo Plus ( 2nd Generation ) , Echo Dot with Clock , and the Echo Studio . Missing one of these devices ? Do n't forget that many Echo speakers could be discounted during Black Friday and Cyber Monday – bookmark our Amazon Black Friday deals page for the latest . Firstly , connect your Fire TV device and Echo speaker to the same network and Amazon account , and open up the Alexa app on your smartphone or tablet . Then , tap on the Devices icon on the lower right side of your screen , and then tap the '+ ' icon at the top right . Select Set Up Audio System , and then choose Home Cinema . You can then select your Fire TV device and give your new home cinema setup a name . Then , select the Echo speakers you 'd like to use ; you can currently select two speakers and an optional Echo Sub – follow the onscreen instructions , and you 're ready to enjoy your films with immersive sound . It 's worth bearing in mind that you 'll only be able to watch content that 's available on Fire TV ; while many of the biggest streaming platforms are available , UK viewers won ’ t be able to find Now TV , and US viewers wo n't be able to stream on Walmart 's Vudu , which is currently a large source of Dolby Vision content .

Security experts have warned that Amazon Echo devices could still be susceptible to a range of flaws . A team known as Flouroacetate were able to hack into an Amazon Echo device due to shortcomings in the security software used to protect the device . Hackers exploiting this `` patch gap '' would be able to overload an affected device to hijack the Echo , and possible even then gain access to a victim 's home network . The findings were enough for the Fluoroacetate team to win the Pwn2Own hacking contest , which is held every year to highlight security flaws in modern-day devices . They used an Amazon Echo Show 5 , which as an older release was particularly at risk due to not being eligible for some of the latest security patches sent out by Amazon . In this case , the device was found to be using an older edition version of Google 's Chromium browser engine , which had been forked during its development . The Fluoroacetate team were able to target this outdated code through the use of an integer overflow JavaScript bug and a malicious Wi-Fi network to hijack the device and take `` full control '' . The team , who netted $ 60,000 in bug bounties as their prize , shared the findings with Amazon , which has said it will be `` investigating '' the flaws and would take `` appropriate steps '' to protect its devices .

New research has found that Amazon Ring smart doorbells may have a number of signficant security flaws . Findings from Bitdefender discovered that the products were leaking the password for the Wi-Fi networks of their users , making the details available for any third parties . The issue appears to affect the Ring Video Doorbell Pro device , which costs around £220/ $ 225 , with thousands of users potentially at risk of having their home networks compromised . Bitdefender 's research found that when a Ring doorbell registered with a user 's Wi-Fi network , it was sending the password needed to join in cleartext . This could have allowed hackers to intercept the password , and then use it to infiltrate the network for malicious purposes . This data was also being sent over an unencrypted connection , putting the user network at further risk . “ When first configuring the device , the smartphone app must send the wireless network credentials . This takes place in an unsecure manner , through an unprotected access point , ” Bitdefender said in a blog post detailing the findings . “ Once this network is up , the app connects to it automatically , queries the device , then sends the credentials to the local network . ” Bitdefender found that hackers could also potentially trigger the reconfiguration of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro by overloading it with a stream of deauthentication messages , making the device get dropped from its wireless network . When this happens , the mobile app loses connectivity and asks the user to reconfigure the device , giving hackers another way in . Bitdefender says that all Ring Doorbell Pro cameras have received a security update that fixes the issues its team found , and that users should download and install this as soon as possible . `` Customer trust is important to us and we take the security of our devices seriously , '' a Ring spokesperson told TechRadar Pro . `` We rolled out an automatic security update addressing the issue , and it 's since been patched .

The Boys is one of the best Amazon Prime series yet , and arguably the best superhero TV show to date , too . Amazon felt so sure about its chances that it renewed the show for a second season before it even arrived in late July , and now that follow-up run of episodes has finished filming . Actor Karl Urban , who plays Billy Butcher on the show , posted the news Instagram while posing with his co-stars : Cut and print ! ðŸ¤ª Thatâ€™s a wrap for Billy Butcher on season 2 of @ theboystv . Massive thanks to our awesome Crew n cast , love you all . 💥The Boys 2💥 On yer telle Mid 2020 # gonefishing🎣 😎💗 Karl Urban A photo posted by @ karlurban on Nov 6 , 2019 at 7:33am PST You 'll also see that he revealed a not-totally-surprising release window for the second year : mid-2020 . That feels like a long way from now , but given how effects-heavy the show is , that 's not a massive surprise . We 'll probably see the show return in the summer months , likely right around the time when season one debuted . We 're speculating here , but the early renewal for season 2 was possibly motivated by how long the lead time is for making a show that 's this action-packed . The Boys stood out for the way it treats superheroes like they 're real-life celebrities â€ “ with all the grim realities , scandals and ugly hero worship that would create . Producer Seth Rogen watched the first episode of season 2 all the way back in August and called it `` way better than I ever could 've hoped it would be '' , and pointed out that the team behind the show has `` more resources '' for season 2 . Expect more characters from the comics to be added , too , including a major new villain in Stormfront , played by Aya Cash . There 's a lot for fans to look forward to , then , and even though it felt like ( mild spoiler alert ! ) season one was written into a bit of a corner , storytelling-wise , we ca n't wait to see where the characters go next year .

Popular Dungeons & Dragons YouTube show Critical Role is coming to Amazon Prime Video , as the streaming service has ordered two seasons of the animated series Critical Role : The Legend of Vox Machina . The series began as a Kickstarter campaign last year , demolishing its goal for a pilot episode , and making enough money through stretch goals to generate 10 full-length episodes . Amazon 's order adds 14 additional episodes onto that , with the total amount divided into two 12-episode seasons . According to a post on the Kickstarter campaign 's page , Amazon 's financial backing will improve the overall production values of the series , elevating the animation , effects , and sound quality . That Kickstarter campaign originally made over $ 11 million . Backers will still get the entire first season as part of their pledge , and early access to the opening two episodes of the season . The season will cover the entire Briarwood storyline from the show , as well as additional stories from the Vox Machina campaign . It was previously adapted into a comic book series , which was published by Dark Horse Comics . Critical Role is a monster hit among the many Dungeons & Dragons shows out there on YouTube and Twitch . Launching in 2015 , it boasts over 688,000 subscribers on the former platform , bringing together professional voice actors Laura Bailey , Taliesin Jaffe , Ashley Johnson , Liam O ’ Brien , Matthew Mercer , Marisha Ray , Sam Riegel , and Travis Willingham .
Amazon 's first true wireless earbuds , the Echo Buds , could double up as a fitness tracker and help you to monitor your running performance – that 's if a new Fitness section in the Alexa app is anything to go by . Spotted by CNBC , the new section includes the option to track a workout , a fitness profile ( which at this stage only has a space to input your height ) , and a Workouts heading . Later , The Verge also confirmed the existence of the Fitness section . CNBC 's Todd Haselton found that he was able to track his steps after saying `` Alexa , start a workout '' – so far , this appears to be the only fitness functionality available , suggesting that this feature is still in its testing phase . While Amazon has n't yet commented on the appearance of these fitness features , we would n't be entirely surprised if the Echo Buds were able to double up as a pair of running headphones . After all , the inclusion of biometric sensors was one of the biggest rumored features surrounding the Echo Buds before their launch in October ; this is also true of the AirPods Pro , which recently launched without the built-in heart rate monitor we were hoping for . Fitness tracking would be a useful addition to the Echo Buds , and given their IPX4 sweat resistance rating there 's no reason why they could n't be used to soundtrack your workout . In addition to one-upping the AirPods Pro , it would also set the Buds apart from competitors like the Sony WF-1000XM3 Wireless Earbuds and the Powerbeats Pro – although with no comment yet from Amazon , whether the Echo Buds ' fitness features come to fruition remains to be seen .

A database is the heart of any application . It ’ s where a web application stores all of the user information such as credit cards , phone numbers , and home addresses . It ’ s what an internal business dashboard uses to track all of the reporting functions that show the health of your firm . It ’ s how a massive e-commerce website tracks all of the product information such as product name , price , features , and SKUs ( stock-peeping units ) . Without a database , there would be no applications -- on the web , on your phone or tablet , or on a computer . Fortunately , a cloud database can deliver all of the benefits you might expect such as auto-scaling , high reliability , and fast performance . And , a modern database can benefit from advances in technology that make the database much faster and more efficient . Amazon DynamoDB is a database that operates in the cloud , but it ’ s also one that operates more efficiently , faster , and with better security than a traditional on-premise database or even a cloud-based database that lacks the high-performance features . To understand what it is and how it can benefit your company , it ’ s important to explain some database terms . Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value database , which is a way of describing how the data is stored . Unlike a traditional relational database such as SQL that assigns a descriptor to each field , a key-value database stores data in a nonrelational way using keys . This type of database using something called an “ associative array ” to store the records . Because this is a more advanced form of a relational database using key values , it ’ s known as NoSQL which stands for Not Only SQL and means the database is meant for high performance and is enhanced by the fact that the database using key values . While this might all sound technical , it ’ s an important distinction because Amazon DynamoDB is built for speed and performance ; it ’ s intended for those with massive data throughout needs . It ’ s also a highly efficient way to use a database in an application , especially if the database contains millions of records . To give you an idea of what this means , Amazon DynamoDB can handle 10 trillion requests per day and at peaks of 20 million requests per second . In practical terms , it means there are few business applications that would stress the database engine or cause issues in terms of reliability , uptime , scaling , or performance . That ’ s why large companies such as Lyft , Toyota , and Capital One use Amazon DynamoDB as their database engine of choice . When there are millions of concurrent users accessing a credit card database at the same time , or many millions of passengers accessing a ridesharing app , the DynamoDB database can not only keep pace but provide nearly instant results . When your staff are free to focus on the actual application and not running the database and the supporting IT infrastructure management , it leads to better applications , services , business dashboards -- and better overall company support and service to end-users . That ’ s one of the main advantages to using DynamoDB -- it is particularly efficient and fast , which helps companies that need that level of throughout and performance to meet the demands of customers . There ’ s no concern about “ can the database keep up ” because the platform can scale up or down as needed to meet dynamically changing user requests . Amazon has called this “ virtually unlimited throughout ” and it means there are no bottlenecks -- in fact , the service is designed to provide a single-digit millisecond response time . As with most Amazon cloud computing services , DynamoDB is designed to operate without direct involvement from your own staff . That means you don ’ t have to configure or setup the database itself , manage the related infrastructure such as the servers , networks , or online storage , and you don ’ t have to maintain the database . Your team doesn ’ t have to think about whether the data is secure , safe from hackers and data breaches -- that responsibility falls on the cloud provider . There are no requirements related to provisioning or patch the data . The huge benefit here is that your company is free to focus on the application itself , not how the database is managed and maintained . It means you don ’ t have to become experts in infrastructure management , server provisioning , storage allocations , or any of the related technologies that are typically needed to make sure the data is available to apps . An important benefit for Amazon DynamoDB specifically is that it is ready for enterprise-grade applications -- the kind that involves millions of users . In the example mentioned previously related to credit card data , as a company scales up and acquires millions of customers , there are no sudden requirements related to archiving and storing the data even as the database grows to petabyte-scale and no need to radically improve endpoint security .
A constant flow of information in business is more like a firehose than any of us want to imagine . It ’ s a steady stream , often bursting at the seams , and it doesn ’ t let up . Tracking and managing that firehose of data can be a Herculean task because you ’ re always playing catch-up -- analyzing the data after it has been transmitted and generating reports at a later date . The problem , of course , is that “ the later date ” never comes and sometimes we process reams and reams of data , store it and archive it , without ever really analyzing it . Amazon Kinesis is a real-time cloud analytics engine that collects , analyzes , and reports on data transmission in your company as it happens , using the power of cloud computing services . You can think of it as a pipe that connects two firehoses -- the data comes in , Amazon Kinesis can analyze it as it transmits , and then the data keeps flowing . Instead of using an analytics dashboard or generating that are only helpful later , you can make business decisions and respond to data flows in real-time . As an example of this , think about a vast multiplayer gaming system where thousands or even millions of gamers participate online . Talk about a steady flow of data . There are thousands of data requests in terms of player movements , rewards they collect , and achievements in the game not to mention the transactional data -- what they purchase in the game and their records in terms of what they can access and how they pay for their membership . For a company running a gaming network like that , it ’ s easy to see how complex the interactions are between gamers , the network , and the IT infrastructure management required to host the game . Amazon Kinesis tracks the interactions at every level as it happens . For example , if there ’ s a new high-score for a multiplayer battle -- say , completing a level in record time or defeating every opponent -- Amazon Kinesis can report on this information within seconds . For other data throughput scenarios , real-time analysis and reporting are incredibly valuable . This can include scenarios such as connected smart home devices and Internet of Things devices , medical records for a large hospital chain , data collected from a car and analyzed for machine learning application such as autonomous driving , or even on a website to find out exactly which sections of an e-commerce website someone visits and where they click . One of the key benefits to Amazon Kinesis is that the business decision-makers , developers , analysts , and data scientists are all better informed and able to make better ( and faster ) decisions . The firehose of data is not so overwhelming . The rich analytics and business intelligence is all available right away , not just as part of a report or a dashboard that summarizes findings . There ’ s no need to wait until all of the data is collected and put under a microscope because the microscope is constantly looking at the data as it flows on the network . There are quite a few practical benefits to this , starting with the ability to improve your service . In the case of the multiplayer gaming system , there are tradition benefits such as reporting back to the user on high-scores and achievements , but perhaps even more importantly it means companies can examine and problems on the system in real-time and deal with them as they occur , not after the problems have caused users to unsubscribe . Another practical benefit has to do with the speed of decision making . Because the analytics are provided in real-time as they happen , companies can then make real-time decisions about that data . In the example of the autonomous car , an automaker might run a simulation in a crowded urban area to see how the robotic vehicle performs , and make decisions about the GPS fleet tracking , location data and the sensors that track how the car adjusts its speed . In a traditional model , where data is summarized later , the automaker might run simulations and then analyze the data later . One reason this is sometimes true has to do with the scope of the needs for data discovery and reporting . Some companies just can ’ t manage and maintain the infrastructure required for real-time data analytics . That ’ s another major advantage to use Amazon Kinesis because the service can scale according to your real-time data analysis needs . There ’ s no need to build-out the infrastructure first or to scale p or down for each new project . This also helps tremendously with the costs . Typically , real-time data analytics is complex , difficult to manage , and requires high-end servers , networks , and vast amounts of online storage but Amazon Kinesis can scale according to the project needs and scope . Yet the costs are related to the actual analytics you perform . With traditional batch processing for data analytics , one that is housed and analyzed in a traditional on-premise data center , that ’ s just not the case .
Amazon 's Ring video cameras have inadequate cybersecurity , possibly leaving consumers vulnerable to cyberattack , according to a new court filing in the US . A proposed class action filed last week claims that Amazon should compensate existing owners who have had their Ring systems compromised , as well as ensure overall security is improved for the product . John Baker Orange , who filed the suit in Los Angeles , complained that his own Ring security system had been exploited by an attacker to spy his children . “ A company that sells a device that is supposed to protect occupants of a home shouldn ’ t become a platform for potentially endangering those occupants , ” John Yanchunis , a lawyer for Orange , said in an interview . Ring was bought in 2018 by Amazon , in a deal said to be worth $ 839 in cash . Providers of other smart devices will no doubt be watching the case closely , not least Google with its Nest system , in case the court rules that they have any form of liability or duty of care to customers when it comes to security . In the meantime , Orange has reportedly upgraded the security on his own system , such as adding two-factor authentication and improving his password . The case has been filed at the U.S. District Court , Central District of California , as Orange v Ring LLC , case no . 19-10899 . Via Reuters .

The answers companies need from their data can sometimes be elusive . We live in an age where data is in great abundance , especially with the expansion into cloud storage . But the tools to analyze and process that data are not always easy to use , overly accessible , or even that effective . The problem ? Data has to reside somewhere , and most companies have to think about how it is stored , who will access it , how to make that secure , and most importantly how to make data access reliable and fast . That ’ s where Amazon Athena can help . It ’ s a query service in that companies are able to run SQL queries against their data as though it resides in a local data center . It ’ s serverless in that you don ’ t have to manage the infrastructure at all or use database software to manage it . And , it ’ s extremely fast . Your staff can run SQL queries and expect results even on large datasets in a matter of seconds . To use Amazon Athena , the data is first housed on Amazon S3 ( Simple Storage Service ) , which is an object storage service that runs in the cloud . Amazon S3 is what makes the data accessible and safe to use , while Amazon Athena is the query service that provides the power to derive the results you need from the data . This means you do n't need to concern yourself about designing databases . One way to think about Athena ? It ’ s somewhat similar to a Google search . You know the data is out there , but it ’ s often hard to find the data sets you actually need . A query is similar to a Google search in that you create the parameters for the SQL query you need to perform . The difference here is that you 're using cloud computing services instead of a search engine . This is not something that requires setup or configuration , which is typically the case with a local data store and can involve an ETL ( Extract , Transform , Load ) which prepares data in a database for a query by isolating the dataset . Instead , your query can run without using ETL and therefore simplifies the process -- you run the query from an easy-to-use web console . You point to your data in S3 , configure the schema , and start the query . One example of how this might work involves a retail company that sells a large number of products with thousands or even million os SKUs ( stock-keeping units ) . A company might want to know if there are SKUs that should be retired . Normally , this might require preparing a complex ETL to configure and prep the data for SQL queries . Because of how the object storage works within Amazon S3 and because of the integration without other Amazon Web Services ( such as AWS Glue Data Catalog ) , the queries work without any prep . This means companies can run a point-of-sale transactional query like the one related to retired SKUs or perform other queries faster and with better results . As with most Amazon Web Services , the major benefit to using Amazon Athena is that it provides great flexibility in how you run queries without the added complexity . One example of this is with a pharmaceutical company using the cloud for genomic research . Your staff might decide to run multiple queries against the data set , but normally each one requires setup and configuration to create a cloud database that can accept the queries . With Athena , the staff can run multiple concurrent queries all at the same time but trust the results will be clean and accessible within seconds . These actionable results from queries will mean that companies have access to clean , reliable data to make better decisions and continue their research . Another advantage to Athena related to this is a lower cost . Companies don ’ t have to manage the footprint required for the datasets , so if they do run multiple queries or need to make decisions related to a vast treasure trove of data , they don ’ t have to first improve the IT infrastructure or configure their data storage to handle the higher number of requests . Athena expands and retracts performance variables as needed for the queries at hand . As mentioned earlier , Athena is flexible enough to handle a variety of tasks related to database queries . It runs standard SQL and supports standard data formats such as CSV , JSON , ORC , Avro , and Parquet . Athena uses Presto -- an open-source SQL query engine -- with ANSI SQL support , so it is not a proprietary query service users will have to learn from the ground up . Athena lets you run quick SQL queries but also supports more complex joins and arrays . In the end , the power comes into play with Amazon Athena because it runs within Amazon S3 , so all of the benefits of that object storage platform for your database carry over to Athena in terms of reducing complexity , providing the endpoint security and performance needed , and allowing companies to run multiple queries without having to manage or configure the infrastructure . Companies can focus more on the actual queries and results , not on the platform itself .

For large companies or those with massive data analytics needs , there are times when basic cloud computing services just won ’ t help . The open-source options might be too unreliable or not fast enough , the on-premise alternatives require too much maintenance , or there are just too many complex variables for an internal IT staff to worry about . Amazon Aurora is a cutting edge relational database that was built for the cloud and has the computing prowess to keep up with the most performance-driven data analytics projects . While a normal cloud database can run using open source options ( including the one from Amazon called RDS or the Relational Database Service ) , Aurora is a major leap forward because it is essentially an enterprise-grade relational database that runs in the cloud , yet it still provides the same intuitive interface of Amazon RDS ( and in fact runs on top of RDS ) . A relational database for enterprise use is a different beast from a normal relational database . The tables are far more complex , but most importantly there is a need for the exceptional speed , reliability , and security that Aurora provides . A pharmaceutical company may be creating a new prescription drug and there ’ s a need to develop it quickly . A government entity may be doing Big Data analytics on a new citywide infrastructure change , such as replacing bridges . An automaker may need to run analytics on the materials used in a new electric vehicle that will need to meet government standards yet be light enough for a better MPG rating . One thing is clear : The needs are much greater than for normal cloud computing services . In some cases , a company may have a need for up to 64 TB of data storage per database instance or for continuous backup of all data which means there is little margin for error . The reliability needs might be for 99.99 % up-time availability . When the Big Data project is related to new drug discovery , the safety of human drivers in a new car , or related to bridges in a city , compromise is not an option . Interestingly , while the Amazon Aurora service is enterprise-grade in terms of performance , scaling , reliability , and security , it is not enterprise-grade in terms of cost . Companies pay a fraction of the cost for this service compared to what they would pay for an on-premise solution or for a competing product that requires a minimum number of instances . In terms of speed , Amazon stats that Aurora is up to five times faster than a normal MySQL or PostgreSQL database instance but it one-tenth the cost . Even with all of the power and performance , the three key benefits to using Aurora are related to simplicity , cost , and security . As mentioned , Aurora runs on top of Amazon RDS so it is the same web interface you might already be using . The heavy lifting and complexity when it comes to an enterprise-grade database in the cloud is usually related to the provisioning , maintenance , scaling , patching , backups , and updating that ’ s required , yet RDS handles all of that . For your staff , the initial setup looks and functions similar to an open-source database on RDS . And , the database instances are all self-healing , auto-scaling , and fault-tolerant thanks to the connection between Aurora and Amazon S3 ( Simple Storage Service ) , the object storage platform that works in tandem with the enterprise relational database instances . Cost plays an important role here because normally scaling up your Big Data project would require an enormous investment in the infrastructure . With Amazon Aurora , it ’ s possible to add up to 15 read replicas per instance simply by choosing that option . There is no infrastructure management , planning or development involved to achieve this high performance throughout . As you scale up , Amazon S3 also scales to meet the storage needs , up to 64 TB per instance . Scaling down is just as important -- companies don ’ t lose the investment they made to handle the biggest projects while it sits idle waiting for the next massive deployment . Endpoint security is a critical component of any Big Data project , especially in the age of data breaches and exposed user information that is often sold on the Dark Web . If a company like Ford is experimenting with Big Data projects with materials or components inside a new and unannounced vehicle , and the data hacked and exposed , it can be a major setback . Aurora uses technologies like network isolation , encryption at rest using key encryption , and encryption during data transmission using SSL . It ’ s also important to note that , since Amazon Aurora uses S3 for storage , that service is also highly secure -- the underlying data used for the Big Data project is archived automatically in the same cluster . There is little opportunity for data leaks when the database itself and the storage are so closely linked .

For any business that needs to analyze reams of data , there are several complex infrastructure challenges to consider . Massive amounts of data require massive storage , server performance has to be optimal , and there ’ s an array of networking and security concerns . Fortunately , Amazon EMR ( also known as Amazon Elastic MapReduce ) is a service that can help with Big Data analysis needs for companies of all sizes . More than just about any other Amazon service , EMR is closely linked to other platforms to help with Big Data analytics , including Amazon EC2 ( Elastic Compute Cloud ) for renting virtual servers and Amazon Amazon Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) for object storage . These products all work in tandem to help companies with the infrastructure and platform needs to run Big Data projects . Imagine the alternative . For a company that is conducting genomic research , analyze traffic data for a city , building a vast machine learning initiative using artificial intelligence to analyze business data across a large company , the infrastructure would have to be deployed in a way that can handle all of that Big Data analytics -- the servers required , the online storage , the networking , and the security to deploy the frameworks you need to run the Big Data project . Instead , EMR runs as a cloud computing service for deploying the frameworks without the related local , on-premise infrastructure management and deployment . With the ability to deploy Apache Spark , Apache Hive , Apache HBase , Apache Flink , Apache Hudi ( Incubating ) , and Presto as services in the cloud , companies can then rely on EC2 and S3 to provide the autoscaling you need as the Big Data project evolves and gathers more and more data . This is the real headache most companies face when analyzing a large amount of data . It ’ s often two simultaneous headaches . First , there are the project and business requirements ( meaning , the reason the project is being conducted int he first place ) , the coding needed to make it all happen , the reporting and analysis deliverables , and all of the related project variables . That ’ s complex enough . Second , companies then also have to build the infrastructure required to handle a project of that magnitude . Known as Petabyte-scale computing , it is a double-edged sword because it ’ s often true that the data scientists and programmers developing the actual Big Data project are not necessarily experts in IT infrastructure . Like many Amazon Web Services , Amazon EMR runs as a service you manage remotely and auto-scales to meet your needs , so there is little to know management involved . Some of the most important benefits to consider with EMR are related to cost and reducing complexity . In terms of cost , as mentioned previously , there is no need to build your own clusters in a local data center that ’ s on-premise . A compute cluster that runs on EMR can cost as little as 15-cents per hour for 10 nodes . Companies pay at a rate of “ per instance ” which means you are not paying for the actual infrastructure to sit idle . There is a minimum charge of only one minute , and of course , companies can then scale up from there as they analyze more and more data and benefit from adding additional nodes . That scaling is important because it means companies don ’ t have to make plans to retrofit an existing infrastructure . As Big Data needs change and evolve to meet business requirements , you can add dozens of additional clusters and nodes or even thousands . An example of this might be a pharmaceutical company that decides to analyze genomic data for drug discovery . The company starts with one product line and one project meant for genomic discovery , but then adds additional projects on more clusters to aid in the drug discovery . As for reducing complexity , it ’ s possible to install and configure an EMR cluster in a few minutes . There is no provisioning , setup , or configuration -- which is amazing considering what is normally required to configure a Big Data cluster running on an Apache Hadoop framework . This means data engineers and scientists and even non-programmers in a company can start using EMR without knowing about back-end infrastructure management . A final word about security : While data breaches are increasingly common and hard to predict or avoid , the benefit of EMR is that all security issues are handled by the service itself -- including server-side encryption , virtual private cloud access , and firewall configuration . This endpoint security happens “ behind the scenes ” and is part of EMR even for the most basic clusters . In the end , Amazon EMR is intended to help companies focus on what they do best -- build the actual project and launch their reporting and analysis tools in the cloud without the inevitable infrastructure problems related to scaling up a project . Companies can work more on the actual deliverables for the analysis and reporting you need , not the back-end .

Apple , Google and Amazon have announced that they will team up to develop an open-source smart home standard to make it easier for manufacturers to create new devices that work together . The goal of the new project is to ensure than any smart device a consumer buys will work in their home regardless of which smartphone or voice assistant their using . Google Nest 's VP of engineering Nik Sathe and the company 's principal engineer Grant Erickson explained how the new open-source smart home standard will benefit both developers and consumers in a blog post , saying : “ Developers and consumers will benefit from this new universal smart home connectivity standard . For developers , it simplifies product development and reduces costs by giving them one standard for building their products . You will then have the power to choose how you want to control your homes , independent of which smart home technology you choose . Smart home devices will be compatible with various platforms , so you can choose between Google Assistant , Amazon Alexa , Apple Siri or other platforms . ” Apple , Google and Amazon have joined forces to form a new group called Project Connected Home over IP that will also be joined by the Zigbee Alliance smart home protocol whose board members include Ikea , Samsung SmartThings and Signify , the company behind Philips Hue . Technology from each of the three tech giants ' existing smart home systems , Apple 's HomeKit , Amazon 's Alexa and Google 's Weave , will also be contributed to the new standard and they plan on releasing an initial draft in late 2020 . Project Connected Home over IP will also work alongside existing connectivity protocols such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as opposed to trying to replace them . According to the group , devices will likely have to support Wi-Fi , Bluetooth Low Energy or Thread in order to work with the new system . The new standard will also be based around internet protocol ( IP ) as should be clear from its name . However , not all devices will need to be directly connected to the internet and IP will be used for sending messages from a smart home device to “ another device , app , or service ” with “ end-to-end security and privacy ” . According to CNBC , Project Connected Home over IP will focus on physical safety devices such as smoke alarms , door locks , smart plugs , security systems and thermostats at its onset with other consumer devices coming down the line .

When it comes to cloud computing , there are two main considerations . One is cloud storage -- the place to keep all of your files in a secure environment . The other is related to the infrastructure , which is how you run the applications and cloud databases for those apps . Amazon Lightsail provides virtual servers that run in the cloud . The product complements Amazon EC2 ( Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ) for storage . There are dozens and dozens of other Amazon services and products , many of them part of Amazon Web Services ( or AWS ) . However , Lightsail is the product that companies rely on for running applications without the complexity of running your own servers in a data center . As such , Amazon Lightsail is a powerful product that can change how you do business . Because it is a virtual server , there are no concerns about scaling up or down as your needs change , no complex configurations to worry about , and no performance bottlenecks that result from poor planning and scaling in your own data center with your own servers . Lightsail can help companies refocus efforts on the actual application development , business requirements , customer support , and other important tasks to help increase revenue and reach more customers instead of the computing environment you use to run those apps . To say cloud computing and virtual servers have changed technology might even be an understatement because popular apps we all use every day would likely not have materialized . All of the benefits of cloud computing apply to Amazon Lightsail , and perhaps more so because it is a robust product that provides a host of features . One of the biggest benefits to Lightsall is that it is easy to use , IT service staff can start and execute a new virtual server for your apps in minutes as opposed to days or weeks ( as they build the required on-premise infrastructure ) . Apps can be pre-configured for Windows or Linux as a stack and the management console looks like a business dashboard you might use to run financial reports . The way the pricing model works for cloud hosting is also an advantage . There is one clear price for the virtual server according to the memory allocation you choose , the number of processors , the application storage needed , and the transfer speed . For example , Amazon lists the price for a virtual server with 512 MB of memory , one processor , 20 GB of SSD storage , and 1 TB data transfer speed as costing $ 3.50 per month . For twice the amount of memory and data transfer speed , the cost is $ 5.00 per month , scaling up from there to a max of $ 160 per month ( that ’ s for a whopping 32 GB of memory , an 8 core processor , 640 GB of SSD storage , and a 7 TB transfer speed ) . If there ’ s ever been a way to easily understand why cloud computing allows you to easily scale for growth , according to those pay levels , this is the best example . Beyond that , Amazon Lightsail is all about reducing management complexity . Your staff doesn ’ t have to configure or maintain the network , any of the endpoint security features , user access , or even the server itself , how it runs , the performance level , and when you need to close it down . Another advantage has to do with extensibility . Often , a company will start with one or two virtual servers that run on Lightsail and configure extra cloud storage but then expand into other service offerings . For example , a company might start with a business app that doesn ’ t handle any financial transactions , and then decide to use an additional service in AWS that extends the capability of its existing app . Or they decide to connect multiple apps together and need services that do that database syncing between virtual servers . Mostly , companies sometimes experience quick growth with apps that suddenly become much more popular , either with external customers or internal corporate apps . The infrastructure you use for this might not be able to keep pace , but with Amazon Lightsail that ’ s not an issue . As your needs change , the app requirements scale up , you add more services and more virtual servers , it is often a simple uptick in a few features within the console to adjust , making the infrastructure management easy and simple . This is a boon for companies that want to create innovative new products without having to think as much about the computing environment you will use . It removes one of the biggest hurdles to fast growth , which often involves improving compute resources . In the end , Amazon Lightsail provides the computing platform companies need to be successful and grow quickly or to scale down services and try new applications that meet the needs of customers in an ever-changing tech climate . It doesn ’ t create the typical restriction of “ living with what you have ” and not ever-adapting to what your customers actually want and need .

John Brandon explains how businesses can use AWS RDS for managing relational cloud databases . One of the most mature and well-known cloud computing products is called Amazon RDS ( Relational Database Service ) . Launched in 2009 , the service is designed to store relational database instances in the cloud for access by applications and as a way to provide relational databases for analytics , reporting , and business dashboards within those apps . To understand RDS , it ’ s important to take a step back and define a relational database . The concept was invented way back in 1970 , and it ’ s essentially a way to store data in a format that is more useful and streamlined . A relational database consists of tables that can be interrelated -- the data is structured in a tabular form and each piece of data can use an identifier . Typically this involves a unique key , although as you can imagine , a database with multiple tables and thousands of rows with unique identifiers quickly becomes complex . Because of the complexity of a large relational database , there are performance considerations to think about -- and other factors including scaling the relational database , accessing it from anywhere using any app , the security needed to protect the data , and the IT infrastructure required to support the database . Companies tend to use multiple relational databases as well . That ’ s where Amazon RDS comes into play . Because RDS runs in the cloud as a service ( and is part of Amazon Web Services or AWS ) , it provides both flexibility and scale . This helps companies as they grow , expand to other areas and provide additional services to customers . You can scale your business apps and the data without having to scale your infrastructure . Many of the benefits of using RDS are similar to the benefits of using the cloud . This includes the flexibility of where the relational database is stored , first and foremost . A company might offer a customer-facing application used on a smartphone or other mobile device , or an internal application for a large company that runs on an internal website . Users might need to access the relational database from a variety of devices , from many different locations , but the cloud makes the data accessible in a way that makes it seem like the data center is sitting right next to you . That ’ s because Amazon RDS has one key advantage -- your IT staff do not need to manage it , or even have to get to grips with database design software , and the RDS can scale as your needs change . One example of how this works is when you compare a typical server in a data center to one in the RDS cloud . You might purchase a server with a set amount of memory , storage , and performance . Then , when you build an application that accesses the database on that server , you are stuck with the allocations you selected ( or you have to manage them and adjust them ) . With RDS , the entire infrastructure is “ serverless ” in that it can adjust to your needs -- whether that is the performance needed , the memory , or the storage . And , this is something that can be automated for your database . This is an important benefit for companies that may start out with only a few apps and a smaller relational database . Most companies expect to grow but some don ’ t know how to scale for the growth from a technical standpoint . Suddenly , a customer-facing app for iPhone or an Android app becomes incredibly popular or an internally designed and developed mobile app changes to meet the needs of quick expansion . RDS is flexible in terms of scaling and how your users can access the databases from apps , but also in how you can use it . For example , you can use database software you already know and use to manage relational databases , including MySQL , MariaDB , PostgreSQL , Oracle , and Microsoft SQL Server . As your needs change , you can even scale up to a different service such as Amazon Aurora which provides even faster performance . Amazon RDS is part of a host of complimentary cloud computing services from AWS as well , such as EC2 for file storage . As mentioned earlier , your staff doesn ’ t need to do all of the management chores , which can include the configurations needed , the adjustments for more performance or storage , the backups , and the security required to make sure your data is safe . One last thing to know is about availability . In addition to the other benefits of Amazon RDS , including the scaling and configuration , your apps can reliably access the data -- it is always available because there is also a secondary instance of the relational database that is hosted in RDS in the event that the first instance should fail for any reason . In the end , Amazon RDS mitigates against the main concern companies have when they develop apps in the first place , either for external use or for internal use . A relational database helps with performance and availability , but companies don ’ t have to constantly adjust their IT operations or even hire more staff to keep up with unexpected growth .

As companies grow , they sometimes rely on methods that don ’ t make sense anymore . One example of that is how businesses process outgoing emails from email clients . Distinguishable from normal web-based email , these transactional emails include the monthly newsletter you might send customers or the reminders an app sends to inform customers about a support issue . Small companies certainly can still use Google Gmail to queue up their email communication and even schedule emails using third-party apps . However , this doesn ’ t work when you are sending thousands of emails per month because of the complexity of the infrastructure . Often , this complexity is due to how a business needs to scale up or down as the business changes . It ’ s related to the business apps you use that send out emails on a routine basis and the marketing campaigns you conduct -- all of which involve more than the simple act of sending emails and includes analysis and tracking , reporting , and a way to respond to messages . Enter Amazon SES , which stands for Simple Email Service . The service is designed for marketing campaigns , company communication , web application transactional emails , and any other activity that involves sending emails to customers , partners , or internally . For those who already use Amazon EC2 ( Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ) for hosting applications on the serverless cloud computing platform , you can send up to 62,000 emails per month for free . After that , the service works in a pay-as-you-go model with a low fee per thousand emails . The basic idea with Amazon SES is to provide a complement to your existing IT infrastructure that allows companies to focus on the content of the emails and not on the infrastructure that ’ s required to process and analyze them . And , due to the scalability of the cloud , there are no concerns over storing email content , performance related to how the transactional emails are sent , or issues with the back-end analytics and reporting you might need to do after sending the emails . Email is a fact of life for many businesses , even as some have moved into the age of Slack and social media . It ’ s expected that any customer-facing application will communicate with a user by sending official emails that explain new features , notify them about security concerns , or provide a way for customers to provide feedback and obtain support . Email is the well-known , official channel for communication for apps , and it ’ s often used for marketing services and campaigns because of how companies can track the success of the campaigns . The problem is that email is also a complex endeavor for companies that need to send thousands and thousands of messages per month from multiple apps , for official company business , and as part of marketing efforts . It ’ s complex in part because of the massive number of messages being transmitted but also due to the strain email can place on platforms . There are concerns over reliably sending the messages , compliance with email marketing regulations , and dealing with the incoming email deluge . Fortunately , Amazon SES has the back-end infrastructure to keep up with the flow . It uses cutting edge content filtering techniques , reputation management features to guard against any issues with regulatory compliance ( avoiding being labeled as spam , since customers opt-in to receive the messages ) , and a vast array of analytics and reporting functions . Amazon SES is a console app that admins can manage and configure for the business needs . Dealing with incoming email is also not a Herculean undertaking . Amazon SES can store incoming messages in an Amazon EC2 bucket , and companies can then use AWS Lambda to process the email using custom code . For example , if your company uses an app to send out an email about new features routinely , and customers reply with questions , you can run a report and create a new email that answers the questions -- for example , by using another service called Amazon SNS ( Simple Notification Service ) that looks for keywords . The most important benefit here is related to cost . As mentioned earlier , Amazon SES uses a pay as you go , model , so even after companies that use EC2 process the free tier of email sends , the costs are extremely low for a business that process thousands of more emails per month or even into the tens fo thousands . The cost is about 10 cents per thousand emails . This scale is where cloud computing is a major asset for companies that might experience quick growth as they add new services or offer more customer-facing apps . As you host each app in the cloud , you can then rely on Amazon SES to handle all of the email processing for you . There ’ s no “ gotcha ” as you grow and expand services and offerings . In the end , every company will continue to process email for customers as they accepted and reliable form of communication and as a method for dealing with transactional emails sent from an app ( both from mobile or on the web ) . It ’ s a technology that is here to stay .
Have you ever wanted to play rock , paper , scissors with Samuel L. Jackson ? Well , now you can , thanks to a new Alexa skill , which lets you change Alexa 's voice to bring Jackson 's dulcet tones to your Echo speaker . The new skill means Jackson can tell you about the weather , sing you a song , and even wake you up in place of your usual alarm – you have a choice of whether you want Jackson to use explicit language or not , too . As well as that , you can ask Samuel L. Jackson more personal questions about his career and interests . To equip the skill , open the Alexa app on your smartphone and tablet , and select Skills & Games from the menu . From there , simply search for 'Samuel L. Jackson - celebrity voice for Alexa ' , and open up the Skill detail page . There you should find an option to Enable Skill . Right now it seems to only be available in the US , and it will set you back $ 1 . That 's part of an introductory offer – after the introductory period ends , it will cost you $ 4.99 . The new skill is part of Amazon 's Celebrity Voice Program , which the company announced at its hardware launch in September . If you were hoping that you could change your default Alexa voice to Samuel L. Jackson full-time , you 're in for a disappointment – to get started , you need to say `` Alexa , introduce me to Samuel L. Jackson '' . Once you 've enabled the skill , you have to preface any requests for Jackson with the Alexa wake word – for example , `` Alexa , ask Samuel L. Jackson where he is from , '' or `` Alexa , ask Samuel L. Jackson to sing Happy Birthday '' . Amazon has come under fire in the past for giving Alexa an objectively female-sounding voice alongside a feminine name – alongside Apple 's Siri , Google Assistant , and Microsoft 's Cortana . While that may not sound like a problem at face value , society ’ s equating of women with voice assistants could have some worrying societal implications . In fact , a May 2019 report by UNESCO suggested that the default use of female-sounding voice assistant in our smart speakers and smartphones perpetuates sexist attitudes towards women , namely that women are docile , subservient , and obliging . Giving Amazon Echo users the chance to speak with Samuel L. Jackson may not address these issues directly , but it does provide a refreshing change that could lead to new Alexa voices in the future – as well as offering direct competition to John Legend 's cameo on Google Assistant devices that debuted earlier this year . Whether Apple will follow suit and furnish Siri with its own celebrity voice remains to be seen , but we 're holding out for a soothing cameo from David Attenborough . Via Engadget
Amazon has scheduled its MMORPG New World release date for early 2020 , and that just means you 'll soon be able to warp back in time to the 17th century . The cinematic trailer for the MMO game was revealed at The Game Awards and , according to the Amazon trailer , the official release window will be May 2020 . New World will take players back to a time when there was still much to explore and focuses on an island called Aeternum , or the Eternal Isle . There players will get to do their own share of exploring . Being an MMORPG , players wo n't be alone . And , that appears to be a very important part of the puzzle . Based on our experience in the New World Alpha , most of the gameplay is centered on how players interact with each other . There were n't scripted events or a guided narrative . New World is an open world sandbox . Players will band together , collect resources , craft equipment , and build fortresses . Other players can go it alone . But , the game is PvPvE , so loners and players in different factions are likely to run into one another on not-so-friendly terms as they vie for the same resources . Those interactions between the players looks to be where the meat of the game will take place . As with Minecraft and Eve , players will be making their own fun within the world that Amazon has built . Though the monsters roaming Aeternum will likely add some extra dynamics to the game . The combat we 've seen in the alpha version was Dark Souls-esque , with stamina factoring into each fight . That may make it simpler than other MMORPGs that are loaded with fantastical abilities ( though there are magical abilities ) . That combat can take place at a massive scale , too , as Amazon has said 100 players can take part in the same battle . Amazon will also launch a New Worlds beta before the official release date , and the full game is available for pre-order now . You can find out more about New World on its website here .

About one decade ago , it was hard to see cloud computing as anything more than a place for online storage and email . Over the last 10 years , it ’ s become obvious that the cloud can meet business needs for analytics and reporting , maintaining the databases used for apps , and even hosting the entire IT infrastructure a company needs to run its operations . Today , cloud computing has advanced to the point where it is almost assumed some of your business functions will run in the cloud . Case in point : a customer call center . With the introduction of Amazon Connect about one decade ago , it might have seemed unusual to move the infrastructure needed for customer support to the cloud . And , in fact , Amazon itself had to develop the technology for their own use and then made it publically available . Amazon Connect is a customer contact center that runs in the cloud . It ’ s omnichannel in that you can use Connect with multiple telecom providers . All of the Customer Relationship Management ( CRM ) features you ’ d expect are available , and Amazon Connect can sync with services like Salesforce if that ’ s the CRM provider you normally use . One of the key features of Amazon Connect is that it uses a pay-as-you-go model . That ’ s important to know because it means companies only pay for the usage they need , and as a company grows and you add more customer service agents to your call center , you can also scale up the infrastructure , connections to telecom providers , and increase your CRM activities to match the business growth ( and any new complexities that result ) . Amazon Connect is also part of the Amazon Web Services product line , which means companies can benefit from a streamlined operation -- not just for their call center , but for all IT service management operations including storage , servers , and networking . All of this scalability , control , and integration is managed from an Amazon Connect web console that is easy to use and not designed only for engineers and IT staff . It means the call center can configure their own operations , choosing the agents who can connect , what they can do using the service , who is a manager or supervisor , and other features they can adjust and reconfigure as the call center changes and expands ( or even as you scale it down as needed ) . In the end , Amazon Connect is an ideal fit for companies that need flexibility , scalability , and affordability but don ’ t want to invest in a product that will only impede your growth . As with any cloud computing service , the main benefit here is scalability . A company could be just starting out and offer a customer service line with only a few agents and still use Amazon Connect . Yet , as you grow and more and more customers need assistance , you don ’ t have to rebuild your internal infrastructure by adding more servers for your CRM software or for your telecom management systems , and you don ’ t have to look for a different contact center provider who can handle the new growth and the resulting infrastructure needs . Another benefit has to do with speed of delivery . When your internal IT staff have to be constantly managing the call center infrastructure , and when you experience downtime as a result , it ’ s the customer who will notice first . Agents won ’ t be available , or there will be errors or other problems with the customer management software , telecom system , or both . Interestingly , Amazon Connect is both easy and fast in terms of the initial setup and installation , and also easy and fast when it comes to expanding services . It ’ s the classic example of a service that can grow along with your company , so any new scaling in services doesn ’ t cause pain points . Reps are “ always-on ” with a cloud call center . As mentioned earlier , another benefit is related to cost . Beyond the pay-as-you-go model , Amazon Connect also doesn ’ t force you to pay monthly fees or service charges , and there are no ongoing maintenance fees . This might be surprising if you have ever had to run a call center or worked with other providers . Often , as a company grows , so do the associated costs . There is often a “ per seat ” charge as you add additional customer service reps . One last benefit to mention has to do with flexibility . On-premise call centers are often complex and don ’ t scale as easily as a cloud call center , but they are also not as flexible . Amazon Connect is similar to other cloud computing resources in that the location of the user is not an important factor . Reps can be spread all over the world and do not need to be located in one central area . They can access all of the same telecom services , CRM apps , and messaging tools to provide the same level of service as a rep who is sitting in your corporate office . More like this :

Following the Department of Defense 's decision to award the $ 10bn Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure ( JEDI ) contract to Microsoft , Amazon has filed a complaint accusing US President Donald Trump of interfering with the deal . The e-commerce giant filed a complaint in the US Court of Federal Claims in which it argued that President Trump launched “ repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks to steer ” the lucrative Pentagon cloud contract away from AWS . While the complaint has been heavily redacted , it makes the case that President Trump aimed to harm Amazon 's founder and CEO Jeff Bezos who also owns the Washington Post . The US President has been a vocal opponent of Bezos and has repeatedly blasted the news outlet for spreading fake news . According to Amazon , Trump 's interference made it impossible for the Pentagon to judge a winner “ reasonably , consistently , and in a fair and equal manner ” . In its complaint , Amazon called for a reevaluation of the proposals submitted to the Pentagon and the company wants the Department of Defense to come to a new award decision . Amazon also questioned how President Trump 's bias affected the DoD 's decision , saying : “ The question is whether the President of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of DoD to pursue his own personal and political ends . ” However , during a recent congressional testimony , top Pentagon technology official Dana Deasy denied that President Trump or the White House had any influence over the JEDI selection process . With $ 10bn on the line over the course of ten years , Amazon 's decision to appeal the contract makes perfect sense but finding out whether or not President Trump had anything to do with the DoD 's decision will likely require a full investigation into the matter .

When it comes to cloud computing services , Amazon Redshift is a powerhouse of data warehousing . Used by some of the largest companies in the world , including Ford Motor Company , Lyft , Intuit , and Pfizer plus countless more , the data warehouse is used to store cloud databases and the related production data . The concept of Big Data hinges on an ability to process , store , and analyze data in vast treasure troves , and that is essentially what Amazon Redshift provides . More than almost any other product , Amazon Redshift has powered the advent of Big Data and data warehousing , allowing companies to build powerful applications and generate reports that provide all of the data they need to run a business . The best way to understand Amazon Redshift is to start with some basic terms and what they mean , and how this adds up to a powerful , fast , and extensive data warehouse product . Once you understand the terms you can start seeing the benefits of the product . One of the first things to understand about Amazon Redshift is that you can start small . Any company can sign up for a single node that allows you to store a database and the related data , and then to start running queries and reports on that data ( and run your own custom applications ) . The first node you create is called the leader node . If you add more , they are called a compute node . You could define Amazon Redshift as a cluster of nodes . Of course , it is far more complex than that -- Redshift forms the basis for a collection of cloud computing products that are part of Amazon Web Services . For the cloud storage component , there is Amazon S3 ( or Amazon Simple Storage Service ) which provides the object storage itself . That said , many companies start with one node when they start a data warehousing initiative . As your data warehousing needs expand and change , you can add more nodes into a cluster . This helps you build more applications , run more queries , and perform more analytics . Pricing can depend on how long you want to keep those nodes active . The prices go down when you reserve nodes for longer periods of time , such as one year or three years . Beyond that , the other important thing to know about Amazon Redshift is that most of the complexity occurs behind the scenes . This includes the endpoint security , management , scaling , provisioning , and anything else related to data warehousing . There ’ s a web console your IT service management team uses to deal with instances and to create new nodes , but you don ’ t have to plan or manage any of the performance characteristics , the back-ups or archives , or any of the infrastructure management related to the database or the data , including the servers or networks . Amazon recently announced some improvements to Redshift . One of the key changes is that the nodes you use can be optimized separately for performance or storage . Previously , a cluster was maintained for both performance and storage allocation . Amazon also improved networking speed , especially the connections between Redshift and Amazon S3 . Amazon claims the Redshift now delivers 3x the performance of competing data warehouse products . As with any cloud computing initiative , the reason to use Amazon Redshift has to do with flexibility . As mentioned previously , companies can choose to create a single node as a starting point , but from there they can create massive clusters containing many nodes for every reporting need they have any for any web application . To say the possibilities are endless in terms of database control is not quite true but with cloud computing , it will seem like it . Another benefit beyond flexibility in terms of what you can do and the applications you run , there is also an advantage to how it is all managed . Your Information Technology staff do not need to manage the cloud computing infrastructure at all , nor do they need to manage the servers , networks , or storage required . Since it is all in the cloud , and it is all part of Amazon Web Services ( or AWS ) , it is all managed remotely and updated automatically . One last benefit to consider is that Amazon Redshift provides the framework for a company to go beyond its current limitations . This might be a new application that uses a database in the cloud ( and data stored in the cloud ) , or it might be a new way to analyze company data . Some firms even create brand new divisions and departments based on their newfound capability to understand and process data . An example of this might be an automotive manufacturer who has the ability to analyze data in real-time and develop autonomous driving features . In the end , the power of Amazon Redshift is only limited by the imagination of the company starting a new initiative , developing a new product , or forming a new division .
Amazon 's Ring connected doorbell and security camera systems already let you keep an eye on unwanted visitors . Now it wants to illuminate n'er do wells – and your home – too . A newly-uncovered patent point to Amazon developing its own range of smart home lighting under the banner of its Ring security devices line . While there are few details to go on aside from the below image posted by tech journalist Dave Zatz to Twitter , an FCC filing shows that the bulb would come with Bluetooth connectivity , as you 'd expect from a smart bulb . Hmmm Ring PAR35 `` smart '' lightbulb . Outdoor lighting line accessory ? Ring Alarm accessory ? Both ? Neither ? : ) pic.twitter.com/zGeCiVK0qRDecember 9 , 2019 This would n't be the first time the Ring brand has released lighting products – its motion-sensing security systems have previously been complemented with connected floodlights and path lights . But the shape of the bulb in the patent points to a product that would more closely compete with the raft of in-home smart bulbs already available on the market , like the leading Philips Hue brand . The choice of Ring branding is interesting – why not Amazon or even Echo / Alexa bulbs ? Whether it 's to deter comparison or the suggestion of competition with products that support the Alexa eco-system , or to bolster the reveal of a Ring-fitting security feature that 's yet to be revealed , we 'll have to wait and see . There 's no official release or pricing information to share at the moment , but the timing of the FCC filing is suggestive of a CES 2020 reveal early in the new year . We 'll be offering up all the details if and when they become concrete then .

UPDATE : After originally removing it , Amazon has officially released the teaser for The Boys : Season 2 for all to see . It probably goes without saying , but the season 2 teaser trailer and article below feature mild spoilers for the show 's first season . The surprise streaming hit of 2019 , the first season of Amazon 's The Boys made a huge splash ( of blood ) when it arrived on Prime Video earlier in the year offering a triple shot of espresso to claims of superhero fatigue . Now , a gruesome ( and awesome ) teaser trailer for the show 's highly-anticipated second season has been revealed at CCXP19 ( which is Brazil 's answer to Comic-Con ) , as reported by Entertainment Weekly . Based on the groundbreaking comic series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson , the show follows a group of vigilantes led by Billy Butcher ( the always amazing Karl Urban ) and their plan to take down The Seven , a Justice League-esque superhero team corrupted by their power and celebrity status . Be warned : the trailer below features copious helpings of blood and gore , along with numerous flipped birds ( if that 's the kind of thing that offends you . [ MILD SPOILERS ] It appears that season 2 will pick up right where the first season left off , with the evil Superman stand-in Homelander ( the magnificent Antony Starr ) revealing a super-powered son , and Hughie ( Jack Quaid ) saving the life of speedster A-Train ( Jessie T. Usher ) , despite the fact he ran through his girlfriend at the start of the show . While the teaser does n't offer a concrete release date for The Boys : Season 2 , it does confirm that the show will land on Prime Video sometime in 2020 .

Amazon is reportedly being looked at in the US regarding potentially anticompetitive policies when it comes to the cloud computing arena . According to a report from Bloomberg , Federal Trade Commission investigators have widened their scope beyond Amazon ’ s retail operations to look at AWS ( Amazon Web Services ) , which could mean the FTC is trying to ascertain whether Amazon is breaching any antitrust regulations with its cloud division . Sources who wished to remain anonymous told Bloomberg that FTC investigators have been questioning software companies around the practices of AWS in terms of whether they could be harmful to the cloud competition . Of course , this is all just a rumor for now – and even if it is true , the FTC probing with some questions here and there doesn ’ t necessarily mean this will go any further than that . When questioned over this by Bloomberg , neither Amazon nor the FTC could be drawn to comment on the matter . Bloomberg mentions that one potential line of enquiry might be whether Amazon could be playing favorites among the third-party sellers on AWS , favoring those who work with it exclusively , as opposed to those who push their products with other cloud providers as well . Bloomberg has previously asserted that Amazon has been under scrutiny regarding its practices with the company ’ s marketplace and third-party vendors who sell their wares on Amazon.com . All of this may come to nothing , of course – and Amazon certainly isn ’ t the only tech giant to be under the microscope in terms of antitrust investigations – but it might be something to keep an eye on . AWS is the world ’ s biggest cloud platform , and has made massive strides with its financial growth in recent times , although the trend of that growth has been slowing down somewhat throughout the course of 2019 . Doubtless at the moment in the cloud arena , Amazon would prefer to concentrate on the big AWS re : Invent 2019 conference , which is now in its final day , and has seen some very significant announcements this week . That includes Amazon making a bid to rule enterprise search , revealing a new custom-built machine learning chip which could pose a threat to Nvidia ’ s profits , and showing off more custom hardware in the form of Amazon ’ s new Graviton2 chips which are aiming to crush Intel Xeon and AMD Epyc processors in data centers . Oh , and there was also a music keyboard which is driven by AI that might just compose the hit songs of the future – but for now is simply a tool to teach developers about machine learning in an interesting and fun way .

Amazon is breaking more fresh ground at AWS re : Invent 2019 with the introduction of a new enterprise search product to rival existing offerings from Google and Microsoft . As with all these offerings , Amazon Kendra provides a means to easily and quickly find the files or content you need , wherever they may be stored across the company . It ’ s powered by machine learning , and uses natural language queries for an intuitive search experience , with Amazon promising a high degree of accuracy when it comes to the search results . Amazon gives us some examples of the sort of queries that users will be able to throw at the system , for example , “ how long is maternity leave ? ” which can be met with a simple answer like “ 14 weeks ” . Something like “ how do I configure my VPN ? ” will obviously require a more in-depth response , and Kendra will pull out a section from a help file or document which details the configuration process . Amazon boasts : “ With Kendra , you can provide pinpoint search accuracy from content within your manuals , research reports , FAQs , HR documentation , customer service guides , and more . ” As with Google ’ s and Microsoft ’ s enterprise search systems , the solution is only as powerful as the connectors available , which allow you to plug it in to be able to search all the third-party apps and services across your company . So unsurprisingly Kendra ’ s preview version offers a starter set of connectors , as it were , for SharePoint Online , Amazon S3 , and databases , with the ability to use the API to hook up your own data sources . When it ’ s released , Amazon says that Kendra will come with a library of connectors for various popular services including Box , Dropbox , Salesforce , and Microsoft ’ s OneDrive . Kendra ’ s machine learning models are constantly updated based on the users ’ search patterns , allowing the system to be honed more for any particular organization as time progresses . Kendra Preview ( which offers a 30-day free tier ) is now available in the AWS console , or via AWS SDKs , in two US regions – North Virginia and Oregon – and also Ireland . There ’ s no indication as yet of when general availability will be reached .
Over at re : Invent 2019 , Amazon has announced a plan to make it easier to find the third-party apps or data products you need on AWS Marketplace . Amazon ’ s solution is the new Discovery API which will be provided to selected partners , and will do what it says on the tin – help folks discover the right products for them . Amazon explains : “ This new feature enables sellers and data providers to curate a narrow set of third-party software and data products by integrating the AWS Marketplace catalog into their web properties . ” One example given is the usage by Deloitte , one of the first adopters of the API , for its ConvergeHEALTH Miner platform ( pictured above ) , with the system ensuring that would-be buyers will only see healthcare-related products . The broad idea is that folks interested in a particular piece of software can get all the details about it from the seller on their platform , and subsequently be redirected to AWS Marketplace to go through with the purchase when they ’ ve made the decision to splash the cash . As mentioned , the Discovery API is already integrated with Deloitte ’ s ConvergeHEALTH Miner platform , and also DLT ’ s Client Portal , with additional platforms to follow soon . Indeed , AWS Marketplace vendors who are interested in integrating the API should contact their Marketplace rep for further info .

Amazon has just launched SageMaker Studio , which it describes as the first IDE ( integrated development environment ) for machine learning . This is another big move which happened over at the AWS re : Invent 2019 cloud conference , with SageMaker Studio aiming to be a one-stop-shop for developers and data scientists hammering out their machine learning workflows . SageMaker Studio covers the whole process of building and training machine learning models , and then deploying and subsequently managing them – at any given scale . Amazon notes that traditional machine learning development is an unnecessarily complex and convoluted process which involves trying to stitch together various tools , and all that palaver isn ’ t necessary with its new service , which delivers everything under one umbrella . The company observes : “ SageMaker Studio unifies at last all the tools needed for ML development . Developers can write code , track experiments , visualize data , and perform debugging and monitoring all within a single , integrated visual interface , which significantly boosts developer productivity . ” SageMaker Studio tracks all steps in the machine learning workflow , and makes it easy for the user to do things like clone them , or tweak them and then run them again , swiftly observing differences and generally making obtaining a suitably honed outcome a quicker process . SageMaker Studio consists of a number of fully integrated tools to cover the full gamut of the machine learning workflow . They include SageMaker Experiments which allows for the tracking and organization of thousands of machine learning jobs ( training , data processing , or model evaluation ) . And there ’ s a Debugger tool which automatically analyzes and troubleshoots training issues , providing real-time alerts on ways to optimize your model training . SageMaker Model Monitor detects quality deviations in deployed models – again delivering appropriate alerts – and allows users to easily visualize potential issues such as data drift , all in a few clicks , Amazon explains . And SageMaker Autopilot builds models automatically , as the name suggests , giving you full visibility into how it has made all the decisions . Finally , SageMaker Notebooks is also now in preview , and delivers an “ enhanced notebook experience ” which lets users create and share Jupyter notebooks with a minimum of fuss – in fact in a single click . Amazon explains that the underlying compute resources are elastic , and easily scalable on-the-fly with no need to interrupt what you ’ re doing . Via TechCrunch
Amazon has launched its first portable Echo speaker , the Echo Input Portable Smart Speaker Edition . The new battery-powered Echo speaker was designed exclusively for India , but will be coming to other markets in the future , according to Tech Crunch , and will begin shipping from December 18 . It 's priced at 5,999 Indian rupees , which works out at around $ 84 / £70 / AU $ 160 based on current conversion rates – although the pricing could be quite different when it launches in Western markets . That 's significantly more expensive than the $ 34.99 / £34.99 Echo Input , the speaker-less Alexa device that was launched in 2018 to allow users to bring the smarts of Alexa to their old-school Hi-Fi systems . The new portable speaker shares the same 'hardware architecture ' as that device . It 's also more expensive than the $ 49.99 / £49.99 / AU $ 79 Echo Dot , although the convenience of portability could justify the new Input 's relatively high price . Plus , you can currently preorder the new Echo Input Portable Smart Speaker Edition for an introductory price of 4,999 rupees ( about $ 70 / £60 / AU $ 130 ) . With a wraparound speaker grille , much like the Echo Dot , the new Input Portable Speaker Edition comes with up to 10 hours of battery life when playing music ( or up to 11 hours of standby time ) . An LED array on the top of the speaker indicates battery life when you press the power button . Like all Echo speakers , the Amazon Echo Input Portable Speaker Edition comes with the smarts of Alexa built right in , so you can ask the voice assistant questions , control your other smart home devices , and access around 30,000 Alexa skills . There 's no word on when the new speaker will come to Western markets , but portability has been a long-requested feature for Echo speakers . The launch of a new portable Echo speaker could prompt rivals such as Google and Apple to create their own portable models – so could we see a battery-powered Google Nest Mini in 2020 ?

Following whispers that Amazon was about to usher in 2nd-gen processors to be used in its servers and data centers , the company has revealed exactly that : new Graviton2 chips . AWS Graviton2 7nm SoCs follow-on from the original Graviton models ( obviously ) and use Arm ’ s Neoverse N1 architecture as the previous speculation dictated . That rumor contended that there would be 32-cores , when in fact the chips will run to 64-cores , and Graviton2 represents a huge performance boost compared to its predecessor . In fact , Amazon says that Graviton2 is capable of delivering up to a sevenfold performance increase compared to 1st-gen-based A1 instances across all cores , and up to twice the performance per core . Memory access will be up to five times faster than the original Graviton chips , too , thanks to additional memory channels and double-sized per-core caches . The new processors were shown off at the AWS re : Invent 2019 cloud conference , with the expected array of slides highlighting the strengths of Graviton2 . That includes a boast about a new generation of ARM-based instances which are 40 % better in terms of price/performance compared to current ( fifth-gen ) x86-based instances . So as expected , these are hitting hard in terms of value proposition and that price/performance ratio . Amazon ’ s own benchmarking shows some big per-vCPU performance gains compared to M5 instances , including around a 43 % increase in SPECjvm 2008 , a 44 % boost in SPEC CPU 2017 integer , and an increase of around 24 % in SPEC CPU 2017 floating point . Amazon further notes : “ The new instances raise the already-high bar on AWS security . Building on the existing capabilities of the AWS Nitro System , memory on the instances is encrypted with 256-bit keys that are generated at boot time , and which never leave the server . ” Amazon says it ’ s working on three different kinds of Graviton2-powered EC2 instances : general-purpose , compute-optimized and memory-optimized . It ’ s now running M6g ( general-purpose ) instances in preview , for testing with non-production workloads , and a full rollout is expected to begin in 2020 . As we observed yesterday , the price/performance ratio on offer with Graviton2 is a very compelling draw , and this truly is Amazon making a real move to push ARM in the data center , an arena that Intel currently dominates – but is also under fire from AMD ’ s top-notch 2nd-gen Epyc silicon .

Rumor has it that AWS ( Amazon Web Services ) is set to bring in more powerful second-gen processors for use in its servers and data centers , with the ARM-based CPUs apparently bristling with as many as 32-cores . The next-gen chips will reportedly be based on ARM ’ s Neoverse N1 architecture and would succeed current AWS ’ first-gen Graviton processors , being something like 20 % faster , according to a report by Reuters which cites two industry sources . As Anandtech , which spotted the report , further notes , Neoverse N1 is designed around providing maximum single-thread performance , running at relatively high frequencies . We are talking clock speeds of up to 3.1GHz , with a likely TDP of around 100W . While Amazon ’ s chips obviously won ’ t be able to rival the likes of Intel ’ s or AMD ’ s server processors in terms of pure performance , by the looks of this , they are set to offer an impressively beefier level of performance than their predecessors . And they will likely do so at a very competitive price/performance ratio ( both in terms of the overall price , and the ongoing cost of running the chips ) . So this could represent a reasonably potent threat to Intel ’ s dominance in the server market , because if these efforts pan out – and remember , this report is just speculation ( albeit from one of the more reliable sources in the tech world ) – AWS could certainly turn to use more of its own hardware . Of course , Intel is already under heavy fire in the server market , fighting a battle against AMD ’ s rival chips . AMD ’ s latest Epyc ( Rome ) processors are innovative and powerful offerings ( running with up to 64-cores ) which have already tempted some big-name defections away from Intel , including Google and Twitter ( and indeed AWS itself – for the time being , perhaps ) .
AWS has made a big move in announcing a new service whereby quantum computers can be hired on a subscription basis . Naturally , quantum computers remain a very niche – not to mention hugely expensive – proposition , with still a very long way to go in terms of developing the tech . However , there ’ s no shortage of customers wanting to experiment with the power of quantum computing , Amazon observes . And the new AWS Braket service , revealed at the re : Invent 2019 conference , is a way to do exactly that , plus it comes alongside a raft of other measures aimed to drive and accelerate the development of quantum computing in general . Braket is described as fully managed AWS service which enables the likes of scientists or developers to use computers from big quantum hardware providers , including the likes of D-Wave ( the first quantum computer manufacturer ) , IonQ , and Rigetti . While a commercially viable quantum computer is still the stuff of dreams , with a number of huge technical hurdles in the way , progress in the field of quantum engineering is being made quickly . And while many businesses want quantum computing right now , with Braket , customers can realistically make a start in the field , and more specifically identify how quantum computers might benefit their operations . Amazon ’ s Braket service will give customers a single development environment in which they can build quantum algorithms using a developer toolkit , and test them on simulated quantum computers , and different quantum hardware architectures . Braket is actually available now in preview form , and you can sign up for the service right here . As to the cost of the service , Amazon notes that pricing will vary according to the hardware provider chosen , and you ’ ll only pay for the time which you use with the quantum computer . No specific figures have been put forward yet , and Amazon says public pricing will be revealed when the service launches in its full form . Of course , quantum computing is a technically demanding field , and so Amazon notes that help is at hand in the form of the Quantum Solutions Lab . The Lab connects customers with Amazon ’ s quantum computing experts in order to help identify how their business might benefit from the tech , and also to collaborate on programs to figure out and test quantum algorithms . The quantum computing initiatives don ’ t stop there , though , with Amazon also announcing the AWS Center for Quantum Computing ( which will be based at Caltech ) . The idea here is to combine the knowledge of Amazon ’ s aforementioned experts with top academic research institutions in order to push forward developing new quantum computing technologies and more powerful hardware . Note that there are rival cloud-based quantum computing efforts out there already , including Microsoft ’ s Azure Quantum offering .
One of the most interesting trends in the automotive industry has to do with third-party add-ons . Modders have added new exhaust systems , hoods , and spoilers for years ( even decades ) , but a new crop of tech mods have slowly cropped up , including rear-view cameras and speakerphones . Recently , I tested one of the best recent tech accessories around , called the Amazon Echo Auto , and for just $ 30 ( it 's currently only available in the US ) it ’ s a smart upgrade . We ’ re not talking about sensors that suddenly provide automated driving features or robotic features , although maybe that will happen eventually . I tested the Echo Auto with a 2020 Nissan Versa that costs $ 14,730 ( about £11,000 , AU $ 22,000 ) on its own . The Versa offers a Bluetooth connection , basic lane-keeping , and excellent gas mileage for a reasonable price , but adding the Echo Auto provided a host of driving aids that surprised me in their simplicity and usefulness . Connecting the device is ultra-simple . You can sync over Bluetooth to your phone first , then connect the Echo Auto to the car stereo using Bluetooth or the included 3.5mm cable . I chose the cable just to keep things easy . The Echo Auto then attaches to the car vent using an included mount . When you need to access the device , you say 'Alexa ' and then ask your question or issue your command . The sound played over the Nissan Versa 's stereo . I immediately tried a few basic functions . I asked for directions , and – because I used an Apple iPhone 11 Pro – the Echo Auto sent me a prompt on my phone to initiate the navigation . I asked a passenger to accept the notification . I could have used the navigation built-in to the Versa of course , but I prefer using voice . With an Android phone , you don ’ t have to acknowledge the prompt and Google Maps will start working on its own . Using Apple Maps with an iPhone was just as easy after accepting the prompt , although you don ’ t see the route and there is no map . ( The Echo Auto only provides audio ; it does n't sync to the display in the car . ) I was mostly interested in other functions , I asked Alexa to play a recent podcast from Freakonomics Radio and it worked perfectly . Later , when I jumped back in the car , I asked Alexa to resume that same episode and that also worked . I tested music playback as well , asked about the weather , and even did some research by asking Alexa some questions . ( I asked about when 3D printers were invented and it provided some nice info . ) Next , I decided to ask about the closest gas stations to my current location . I was surprised that it worked . When Alexa reminded me that I could ask about phone numbers , it dawned on me that the device is also a great speakerphone for phone calls . I called my wife by asking Alexa to dial the Amazon Show speaker I have at home and that worked . Someday , we ’ ll be able to make a video call and turn the car over to the bot , but ( for now ) only voice calls work . I could see where this will help in the future . Adding Alexa meant I was able to focus on driving more and didn ’ t ever fiddle with the radio . I could carry on an entire conversation . Someday , we ’ ll be able to ask Alexa to drive the car or to stop , let us out , and go pick up someone at the mall . We ’ ll stay in contact with Alexa using our phone . It might seem far-fetched , but we ’ ll use bots more and more when they can do things for us that we don ’ t want to do . As a way to augment features on the economically priced Nissan Versa , the Echo Auto was a smart and low-cost alternative . Some vehicles , mostly from Ford , work with Alexa on their own without adding any other products . For this test , I was happy Alexa came along for the ride .

Over at AWS re : Invent 2019 , Amazon has launched a new machine learning-powered service which can transcribe conversations between doctors and patients , effectively creating a digital copy of those consultations with relative ease . Amazon Transcribe Medical automatically ( and accurately ) converts speech-to-text and recognizes medical terms , putting that text straight into the patient ’ s medical record . It can also pull off tricks like inserting punctuation so the doctor doesn ’ t have to worry about dictating commas , periods and so forth . This is essentially a tailored version of Amazon Transcribe , an automatic speech recognition service that Amazon launched back in 2017 . Amazon Transcribe Medical can also be hooked up with Amazon Comprehend Medical , the latter being a natural language processing service which is capable of extracting all kinds of relevant medical information from any given transcription ( like the details on medical conditions , medication and doses , frequency of taking , and so forth ) . The big idea is that with all this taking place in the background , and being handled automatically , the physician can forget about note-taking , and concentrate fully on the patient and their needs . So even if the doctor only has limited time with the patient – as can often be the case these days – at least they can spend that time in a more productive and effective manner . Amazon Transcribe Medical is now available to AWS customers , although only in certain parts of the US at the moment , namely in the US East ( North Virginia ) and US West ( Oregon ) regions . Matt Wood , VP of artificial intelligence at AWS , told CNBC that the service is fully HIPAA compliant and its accuracy is ‘ very high ’ , and that in the future , Amazon may publish research showing how it compares favorably to rival offerings .
